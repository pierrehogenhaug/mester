-----

Prospective purchasers that are QIBs are hereby notified that the sellers of the Securities may be

relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A
under the U.S. Securities Act.

You are reminded that the Offering Memorandum has been delivered to you on the basis that you

are a person into whose possession the Offering Memorandum may be lawfully delivered in accordance
with the laws of the jurisdiction in which you are located and you may not, nor are you authorized to,
deliver the Offering Memorandum to any other person.

Under no circumstances shall the Offering Memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation

of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of the Securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer,
solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

The Securities are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to, and should not

be offered, sold or otherwise made available to, any EEA retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes,
the expression “EEA retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a “retail client” as defined
in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution
Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article
4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a “qualified investor” as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently,
no key information document required by Regulation (EU) 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs
_Regulation”) for offering or selling the Securities or otherwise making them available to EEA retail_
investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Securities or otherwise making
them available to any EEA retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. The
Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Securities in any member state
of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement
to publish a prospectus for offers of notes. The Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes
of the Prospectus Regulation.

The Securities are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be

offered, sold or otherwise made available to any U.K. retail investor in the U.K. For these purposes, a “U.K.
_retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a “retail client” as defined in point (8) of_
Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; (ii) a
customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the
FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) 600/2014 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the U.K.
Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU)
1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “U.K. PRIIPs Regulation”) for
offering or selling the Securities or otherwise making them available to U.K. retail investors in the U.K.
has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Securities or otherwise making them available to
any U.K. retail investor in the U.K. may be unlawful under the U.K. PRIIPs Regulation. The Offering
Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Securities in the U.K. will be made pursuant
to an exemption under the U.K. Prospectus Regulation and the FSMA from the requirement to publish a
prospectus for offers of notes. The Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the U.K.
Prospectus Regulation.

Any distributor subject to MiFID II (for the purposes of this paragraph, a “distributor”)

subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Securities is responsible for undertaking its own target
market assessment in respect of the Securities and determining the appropriate distribution channels for the
purposes of the MiFID II product governance rules under Commission Delegated Directive (EU) 2017/593


-----

(“Delegated Directive”). Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchaser make any representations or warranties
as to a distributor's compliance with the Delegated Directive.

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market

assessment in respect of the Securities has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Securities
is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook
(“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic
law by virtue of the EUWA (“U.K. MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Securities to eligible
counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending the Securities (for purposes of this paragraph, a “distributor”) should take into consideration
the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product
Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the Securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

The materials relating to the Offering do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an

offer or solicitation in any place where such offers or solicitations are not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction
requires that the Offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the Initial Purchaser (as defined in
the Offering Memorandum) or any affiliate of the Initial Purchaser is a licensed broker or dealer in that
jurisdiction, the Offering shall be deemed to be made by such Initial Purchaser or such affiliate on behalf
of Deuce FinCo plc (the “Issuer”) in such jurisdiction.

The Offering Memorandum is for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional experience

in matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act
2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the “Order”), (ii) are persons falling within Article
49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth companies, unincorporated associations etc.”) of the Order, (iii) are outside
the United Kingdom; or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment
activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) in connection with the issue or sale of any
securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated, all such persons
together being referred to as “Relevant Persons.” This document is directed only at Relevant Persons and
must not be relied on by persons who are not Relevant Persons. The Securities are only available to, and
any invitation, offer or agreement to subscribe, purchase or otherwise acquire such Securities will be
engaged in only with, Relevant Persons. The Offering Memorandum and its contents are confidential and
should not be distributed, published or reproduced (in whole or in part) or disclosed by any recipients to
any other person. Any person that is not a Relevant Person should not act or rely on the Offering
Memorandum or its contents. The Securities are not being offered to the public in the U.K.

No person may communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage

in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with
the issue or sale of the Securities other than in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not
apply to the Issuer or the Guarantors.

The attached Offering Memorandum has been sent to you in an electronic format. You are reminded

that documents transmitted in an electronic format may be altered or changed during the process of
transmission and consequently none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser and their respective affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, representatives and agents accepts any liability or responsibility whatsoever

On the Issue Date, the Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer, rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s existing and future indebtedness
that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, senior to all existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes

secured by a limited recourse English law share charge over all shares in the Company and an English law security assignment over any structural intercompany loans
from Deuce ParentCo Limited to the Company (the “Closing Date Collateral”). No later than two business days from the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security
Principles and certain applicable perfection requirements, the Notes and the Guarantees will be secured by an English law debenture over certain material assets of the
Issuer and the Guarantors that are incorporated in England, including first fixed equitable security over any leasehold interests other than any leasehold interest that has
35 years or less to run, subject to receipt of landlord consent (if required) (the “Post Closing Date Collateral” and together with the Closing Date Collateral, the
“Collateral”). See “Description of the Notes—Security—The Collateral.” The Collateral will also secure the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the New
Revolving Facilities Agreement, any Hedging Obligations and any Operating Facility. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any liabilities in respect of
the New Revolving Facilities Agreement and any Hedging Obligations (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) that are secured by the Collateral will receive priority
with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over such Collateral.

The Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral may be released under certain circumstances. The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security
and the liability of each Guarantor and security provider will be subject to certain significant limitations as described in “Risk factors—Risks related to our financial
_profile, the Notes and the Guarantees—The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that will have been granted as security for the Notes and_
_the Guarantees, and such security may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.” Subject to the terms of the Indenture, the New_
Revolving Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Collateral may be pledged to secure future indebtedness. This Offering Memorandum includes more
detailed information on the terms of the Notes and the Guarantees, including redemption and repurchase prices, security, covenants, events of default and transfer
restrictions.

acknowledgements that are described in this Offering Memorandum under “Transfer restrictions.”
The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities
laws of any state of the United States and are subject to certain restrictions on transfer and resale.
The Notes have not been and will not be recommended by or approved by the SEC, any state

securities commission or authority passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this Offering
Memorandum. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense. This Offering
Memorandum is being provided (1) to a limited number of U.S. investors that we reasonably
believe to be qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act for
informational use solely in connection with their consideration of the purchase of the Notes and
(2) to investors outside the United States pursuant to offshore transactions complying with
Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act. Prospective purchasers are
hereby notified that the seller of any Note may be relying on the exemption from the provisions of
Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act. For a

**Notice to investors in the European Economic Area**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should

not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any EEA retail investor in the European
Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, the expression “EEA retail investor” means a person
who is one (or more) of: (i) a “retail client” as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or
(ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer
would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or
(iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, no key
information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to EEA retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and
therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any EEA retail
investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. The Offering Memorandum
has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in any member state of the EEA will be
made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish
a prospectus for offers of notes. The Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes
of the Prospectus Regulation.

Any distributor subject to MiFID II (for the purposes of this paragraph, a “distributor”)

subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes is responsible for undertaking its own
target market assessment in respect of the Notes and determining the appropriate distribution
channels for the purposes of the MiFID II product governance rules under Commission Delegated


-----

Directive (EU) 2017/593 (“Delegated Directive”). Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchaser
make any representations or warranties as to a distributor's compliance with the Delegated
Directive.

**Notice to investors in the United Kingdom**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should

not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any U.K. retail investor in the U.K. For these
purposes, a “U.K. retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as
defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the EUWA; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any
rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive,
where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article
2(1) of Regulation (EU) 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii)
not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the U.K. Prospectus Regulation. Consequently
no key information document required by the U.K. PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the
Notes or otherwise making them available to U.K. retail investors in the U.K. has been prepared
and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any U.K. retail
investor in the U.K. may be unlawful under the U.K. PRIIPs Regulation. This Offering
Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in the U.K. will be made
pursuant to an exemption under the U.K. Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a
prospectus for offers of notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of
the U.K. Prospectus Regulation.

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market

assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes
is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook COBS, and professional clients,
as defined in the U.K. MiFIR; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible
counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling
or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’
target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product
Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook is responsible for undertaking its own target
market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target
market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

This Offering Memorandum is for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional

experience in matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services
and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the “Order”), (ii) are
persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Order (“high net worth companies,
_unincorporated associations etc.”), (iii) are outside the U.K., or (iv) are persons to whom an_
invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the
FSMA) in connection with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully be
communicated or caused to be communicated, all such persons together being referred to as
“Relevant Persons.” This document is directed only at Relevant Persons and must not be relied on
by persons who are not Relevant Persons. The Notes are only available to, and any invitation, offer
or agreement to subscribe, purchase or otherwise acquire such Notes will be engaged in only with,
Relevant Persons. This Offering Memorandum and its contents are confidential and should not be


-----

distributed, published or reproduced (in whole or in part) or disclosed by any recipients to any
other person. Any person that is not a Relevant Person should not act or rely on this Offering
Memorandum or its contents. The Notes are not being offered to the public in the U.K.

**TO AN INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES.**


-----

**Presentation of financial and other information**

**and use of non-IFRS financial information**

**Financial statements presented**

**_Financial information of the Issuer and the Company_**

The Issuer is a newly formed entity incorporated on May 6, 2021 for purposes of facilitating

the Transactions and performing certain activities related thereto. The Issuer is a wholly owned
direct subsidiary of the Company. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer has no
revenue-generating activities of its own, and no business operations, material assets or liabilities
other than those acquired or incurred in connection with its incorporation and the Transactions. As
a result, no historical financial information of the Issuer is included in this Offering Memorandum.

The Company was incorporated on May 18, 2018 as a holding company. The Company is

indirectly owned by Deuce Holdco Limited (“HoldCo”). As of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, the Company has no revenue-generating activities of its own, and no business
operations, material assets or liabilities other than (i) certain existing indebtedness which will be
repaid with the proceeds of the Transactions (see “Use of proceeds”) and (ii) a £2.0 million annual
monitoring fee payable to TDR Capital. As a result, no historical financial information of the
Company is included in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Historical Financial Information of Holdco_**

The consolidated historical and other financial data presented in this Offering

Memorandum have been derived from (i) the audited consolidated financial statements of HoldCo
as of and for the period from January 4, 2018 to December 31, 2018 and as of and for the years
ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, including the accompanying notes thereto, which have been
prepared in accordance with IFRS and which have been audited by Deloitte LLP and (ii) the
unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of HoldCo as of and for the three
months ended March 31, 2021, including accompanying notes thereto (with comparable financial
information for the three months ended March 31, 2020), which have been prepared in accordance
with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting, in each case included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum. References to the “Group,” “us” or “our” in the context of historical financial
information or other financial information relate to HoldCo and its subsidiaries. The audit reports
for the period from January 4, 2018 to December 31, 2018 and as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2020, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, express an
unqualified opinion for each of the respective periods and the audit report in relation to the audited
consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 include a
material uncertainty paragraph related to going concern as set forth in Note 2 to such financial
statements.

IFRS 16 (Leases) was published on January 13, 2016 by the International Accounting

Standard Board. It became effective on January 1, 2019 and applies to the first full financial year
commencing on or after that date. Our first full financial year following the effective date of IFRS
16 began on January 1, 2019, and we applied the modified retrospective approach of adopting the
new standard, which did not require a restatement of comparative results for the financial period


-----

ended December 31, 2018. On adoption of IFRS 16, the Group recognized lease liabilities in
relation to leases which had previously been classified as “operating leases” under the principles
of IAS 17. These liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments,
discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate as of January 1, 2019. The weighted
average lessee’s incremental borrowing rate applied to the lease liabilities on January 1, 2019 was
6.8%. For leases previously classified as “finance leases,” the carrying amount of the lease asset
and lease liability immediately before transition were recognized as the carrying amount of the
right-of-use asset and the lease liability at the date of initial application. For more information on
the adoption of IFRS 16 and the adjustments made in relation thereto, see “Management’s
_discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations—Factors affecting_
_comparability of our results of operations—Adoption of IFRS 16” and Note 33 to the HoldCo_
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, we identified that both deferred tax asset

balances and reserves had been understated by £21 million as of December 31, 2019. As a result,
we have restated the consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2019. As
mentioned above, the Group adopted IFRS 16 Leases retrospectively with the cumulative effect of
its application being recognized as of January 1, 2019, but did not restate comparatives for the
2018 reporting period, as permitted under the specific transition provisions in the standard. The
adjustments arising from the new leasing rules were therefore recognized in the opening balance
sheet on January 1, 2019. There were no errors related to the adoption of IFRS 16 itself. The error
was restricted to the deferred tax calculation. The misstatement of the deferred tax balances related
to the complexities of the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases retrospectively from January 1, 2019. There
is no impact on the consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the
effect on the consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2019 was to increase
the opening January 1, 2019 deferred tax assets by £21 million and to reduce accumulated losses
as of January 1, 2019 by £21 million.

In this Offering Memorandum, we present certain financial and other operating data as of

and for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition to its usefulness as regards our historical
performance, this data represents the ordinary course operations of our business in a steady state,
before the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have also presented the historical financial and
other operating data as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the three months ended
March 31, 2021, which represents the impact on our business of the COVID-19 pandemic as the
majority of our clubs were closed during the First Lockdown and the Second Lockdown (each as
defined herein).

Our consolidated financial statements include the results of operations and financial

position of HoldCo, which are not attributable to the Company or its subsidiaries. As a result, the
consolidated financial statements of HoldCo are not directly comparable to the historical financial
information of the Company and its subsidiaries, which is prepared in accordance with IFRS. The
main differences between the consolidated financial position and results of operations of HoldCo
and the Company (i) as of and for the period from January 4, 2018 to December 31, 2018, related
to interest income in relation to shareholder loans from HoldCo to its direct and indirect
shareholders and cash on balance sheet held under HoldCo’s name, which amounted to £2.3
million and £1.0 million, respectively, and a shareholder loan from HoldCo to the Company which
amounted to £5.9 million; (ii) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, related to the


-----

balance of a shareholder loan from HoldCo to its shareholder and cash on balance sheet held under
HoldCo’s name, which amounted to £2.1 million and £1.5 million, respectively, and £0.2 million
additional finance cost incurred by the Company in relation to interest paid on a £5.3 million
shareholder loan from HoldCo to the Company; (iii) as of and for the year ended December 31,
2020, related to the balance of a shareholder loan from HoldCo to its shareholder and cash on
balance sheet held under HoldCo’s name, which amounted to £2.2 million and £1.4 million,
respectively, and £0.1 million additional finance cost incurred by the Company in relation to
interest paid on a £5.9 million shareholder loan from HoldCo to the Company; (iv) as of and for
the three months ended March 31, 2020, related to the balance of a shareholder loan from HoldCo
to its shareholder and cash on balance sheet held under HoldCo’s name, which amounted to £2.1
million and £1.5 million, respectively, and a £5.7 million shareholder loan from HoldCo to the
Company and (v) as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2021, related to the balance of a
shareholder loan from HoldCo to Deuce TopCo Limited and cash on balance sheet held under
HoldCo’s name, which amounted to £2.2 million and £1.4 million, respectively, and a £6.0 million
shareholder loan from HoldCo to the Company. As such differences are not material, the financial
and operating results and certain other information relating to HoldCo have been presented in this
Offering Memorandum in lieu of the Company. We believe that HoldCo’s consolidated financial
statements, subject to the differences noted above, adequately reflect the Company’s consolidated
financial results and financial position for the applicable periods.

The financial information and financial statements included in this Offering Memorandum

are presented in pound sterling.

Certain numerical figures included in this Offering Memorandum have been rounded.

Therefore, discrepancies in tables between totals and the sums of the amounts listed may occur
due to such rounding.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires us to use certain

critical accounting estimates. It also requires our board of directors to exercise its judgment in the
process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of
judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the
consolidated financial statements, are described in “Management’s discussion and analysis of
_financial condition and results of operations—Critical accounting estimates and judgments.”_

The financial information included in this Offering Memorandum is not intended to comply

with the applicable accounting requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and the related rules and
regulations of the SEC, which would apply if the Notes were being registered with the SEC.

**Non-IFRS measures**

We have included certain non-IFRS financial measures in this Offering Memorandum.

Non-IFRS financial measures are derived on the basis of methodologies other than IFRS and the
non-IFRS measures we present may also be defined differently than the corresponding terms under
the Indenture. We present the following non-IFRS financial measures in this Offering
Memorandum:


-----

- “Adjusted EBITDA” represents loss for the financial year, before net finance cost, income
tax (credit)/charge on ordinary activities and depreciation and amortization and further
adjusted for long-term incentive plan charges and non-recurring redundancies, profit/(loss)
on disposal of property, plant and equipment, pre-opening costs, monitoring fees –
managerial advice, non-executive director fees, closed club costs, acquisition and aborted
expenses, insurance proceeds from damage to property, plant and equipment, IFRS 16
transition and other diligence costs, foreign exchange difference, utilization of onerous
lease provision, non-cash rent accrual (excluding lease incentive accrual), share of loss of
equity accounted investments, exceptional and other non-recurring items including
impairment of property, plant and equipment, impairment of right-of-use assets,
impairment of intangible assets, cost of lease re-negotiations, business restructuring,
refinancing transaction and acquisition related costs, impairment of investment, India joint
venture losses, onerous lease provision charge and release of legal provision and includes
all rental payments in respect of finance leases and rent expense (replaced with depreciation
and interest under IFRS 16).

- “Adjusted EBITDA Margin” is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA for a period by
the revenue for such period.

- “Adjusted EBITDAR” represents Adjusted EBITDA for a period before rental payments in
respect of finance leases for such period.

and change in net working capital for a period from Adjusted EBITDA for such period and
dividing the result thereof by Adjusted EBITDA for such period.

- “Free Cash Flow Post-Exceptional Items” represents Adjusted EBITDA for a period, less
Maintenance Capital Expenditure for such period, adjusted for the change in net working
capital, less Investment Capital Expenditure, Pipeline Capital Expenditure, business
restructuring costs and refinancing transaction and acquisition related costs for such period.

- “Investment Capital Expenditure” is the discretionary spend comprising refurbishment
works and club upgrades that improve an existing club’s offering. See “Management’s
_discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Capital_
_expenditures.”_

cash equivalents as of a certain date.

- “Pipeline Capital Expenditure” is the discretionary spend relating to the expansion of our
facilities through the development or acquisition of new sites. See “Management’s
_discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Capital_
_expenditures.”_

- “Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA” represents Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended
December 31, 2019 further adjusted for (i) the annualized effect of our blended price rises
implemented in January 2020, cost inflation, additional rent costs following our sale and
lease back transactions completed in the second half of 2019 and in December 2020, the
impact of rent negotiations and our estimate of the full period impact of costs savings
resulting from our Fit For Growth Program implemented in December 2020 and (ii) the
standalone EBITDA of the Meridian Group for the year ended December 31, 2019, which
we acquired in January 2020, adjusted for our estimate of the expected increase in EBITDA
following our extensive refurbishment works and improvements of the Meridian clubs
bringing club quality and offering in line with our estate (which contributes to yield and
volume gains) and our estimate of the full period impact of expected head office and head
count cost savings as a result of synergies between the Group and the Meridian Group and
management initiatives, including quasi-proprietary pricing and promotional techniques
used to drive new membership sales, as well as data science used to reduce attrition rates.
_Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA is not adjusted for the closure of two non-_
performing clubs in Dordrecht in December 2020 and in Solihull in January 2021, which
had a negative aggregate Adjusted EBITDA of £0.3 million for the year ended December

- “Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA Margin” is calculated by dividing Pro Forma Run
Rate Adjusted EBITDA for a period by the Pro Forma Run Rate Revenue for such period.


-----

adjusted for (i) the annualized effect of our blended price rises implemented in January
2020 and (ii) the standalone revenue of the Meridian Group for the year ended December
31, 2019, which we acquired in January 2020, adjusted for our estimate of the expected
increase in revenue following our extensive refurbishment works and improvements of the
Meridian clubs bringing club quality and offering in line with our estate (which contributes
to yield and volume gains) and our estimate of the full period impact of expected
management initiatives, including quasi-proprietary pricing and promotional techniques
used to drive new membership sales, as well as data science used to reduce attrition rates.
_Pro Forma Run Rate Revenue is not adjusted for the closure of two non-performing clubs_
in Dordrecht in December 2020 and in Solihull in January 2021, which had an aggregate
revenue of £2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

We present a reconciliation of the non-IFRS measures to the most directly comparable

measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS under “Summary historical
_consolidated financial and other data.”_

Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA, Cash Conversion Ratio, Pro Forma Run Rate

Adjusted EBITDA and _Pro Forma_ Run Rate Revenue to assess our operating performance.
Adjusted EBITDA is considered the key measure of profitability. It is considered by management
to be the supplemental measure to understand the underlying trading and financial performance of
our business and is the measure used to report to both the board and external lenders. In addition,
we believe these metrics are measures that are useful to investors. Adjusted EBITDA, Cash
Conversion Ratio, Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Run Rate Revenue are
not presentations made in accordance with IFRS, and our use of such terms varies from others in
our industry. These metrics should not be considered as alternatives to revenue, profit/(loss),
operating profit/(loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS as
measures of operating performance or operating cash flows as measures of liquidity. In addition,
Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently from
the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” under the Indenture. Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma
Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not
consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under IFRS. For
example, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA:

  - exclude certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us;

  - do not reflect any capital expenditure;

  - do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

  - do not reflect the significant financial expense, or the cash requirements necessary to
service interest payments, on our debts;

  - adjust for items of which we believe the quantum, nature or volatility would distort the
underlying trading performance of the Group, as they are not expected to repeat in future
periods, including the tax effect thereof; and


-----

  - in the case of Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted
EBITDA Margin and Pro Forma Run Rate Revenue, do not reflect the impact on our
results of operation of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Because of these limitations, our non-IFRS measures should not be considered as measures

of discretionary cash available to us in order to invest in the growth of our business or as measures
of cash that will be available to us in order to meet our obligations. You should compensate for
these limitations by relying primarily on our IFRS results and using these non-IFRS measures only
in a supplemental manner to evaluate our performance. Such non-IFRS financial information has
not been audited or reviewed by Deloitte LLP.

Key performance indicators and the other non-financial operational data included in this

Offering Memorandum are not part of our financial statements and have not been audited or
reviewed. Our use or computation of these indicators may not be comparable with the use or
computation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies. None of the key
performance indicators or other non-financial operating data included in this Offering
Memorandum should be considered in isolation or as an alternative to any indicator of our
operating performance cash flows or other measure of performance derived in accordance with
IFRS.

**Adjusted financial information**

This Offering Memorandum also includes certain unaudited _adjusted consolidated_

financial information of HoldCo, including adjusted cash and cash equivalents, adjusted interest
expense, adjusted net debt and adjusted total debt and leverage and coverage ratios. Such measures
reflect the following:

  - _Adjusted cash and cash equivalents is cash and cash equivalents adjusted for expected_
ordinary course movements in our cash and cash equivalents between March 31, 2021
and June 30, 2021, based on management estimates, including revenue generated and

**Market and industry data**

We obtained market data and certain industry data and forecasts included in this Offering

Memorandum from internal company surveys, market research, consultant surveys, publicly
available information, reports of governmental agencies and industry publications and surveys.
Sources of certain data in this Offering Memorandum include Barclays, Deloitte, LDC London,
OC&C Strategy Consultants, Statista and UKactive.

In many cases, there is no readily available external information from independent third

parties (whether from trade associations, government bodies or other organizations) to validate
market related analyses and estimates, requiring us to rely on our own internal estimates regarding,
among others, the health and fitness industry, our competitive position, our market share and the
market shares of various industry participants, all of which are based on our experience and
knowledge of these industries, our own investigation of market conditions and our review of
industry publications, including information made available to the public by our competitors.

Industry surveys, publications, consultant surveys and forecasts generally state that the

information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that the
accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed. Market studies and analyses are
frequently based on information and assumptions that may not be accurate or technically correct,
and their methodology may be forward looking and speculative. Surveys are limited by
considerations such as sample size, bias and quality of responses due to respondents being
uncomfortable providing answers that present themselves in an unfavorable manner, among others.
No third party whose information is referenced in this Offering Memorandum under credit to it,
assumes any liability towards the user with respect to its information. Neither we nor the Initial
Purchaser have independently verified any of the data from third-party sources, nor have we
ascertained the underlying economic assumptions relied upon therein. Similarly, certain estimates
are based on internal surveys, management’s views, industry forecasts and market research, which
we believe to be reliable based upon our management’s knowledge of the industry, have not been
independently verified and we cannot assure you that any of these estimates are accurate or
correctly reflect our position in the health and fitness industry. They may differ from estimates
made by our competitors or from other independent sources. Statements as to our market position
are based on recently available data. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding our
industry or similar data presented herein, such data involve risks and uncertainties and are subject
to change based on various factors, including those discussed under the heading “Risk factors”
appearing elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. As a result, the market and industry
information included in this Offering Memorandum should be viewed with caution and neither we
nor the Initial Purchaser make any representation as to the accuracy or completeness of any such
information in this Offering Memorandum.

**Exchange rate and currency information**

Unless otherwise indicated, references in this Offering Memorandum to “euro” or “€” are

to the single currency of the participating member states of the EU participating in the third stage
of economic and monetary union pursuant to the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, as amended
or supplemented from time to time, references to “sterling,” “pound sterling,” “GBP” or “£” are
to the lawful currency of the U.K. and references to “U.S. dollar,” “dollar,” “U.S.$” or “$” are to
the lawful currency of the United States of America.

The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the high, low, average and period

end Bloomberg Composite Rate (New York) expressed as U.S. dollars per £1.00 and euro per
£1.00. The Bloomberg Composite Rate is a “best market” calculation, in which, at any point in
time, the bid rate is equal to the highest bid rate of all contributing bank indications and the ask
rate is set to the lowest ask rate offered by these banks. The Bloomberg Composite Rate is a midvalue rate between the applied highest bid rate and the lowest ask rate. Neither we nor the Initial
Purchaser make any representation that the pound sterling, U.S. dollar or euro amounts referred to
in this Offering Memorandum have been, could have been or could, in the future, be converted
into U.S. dollars, pound sterling or euro, as the case may be, at any particular rate, if at all.

The average rate for a period means the average of the final daily Bloomberg New York

Composite Rates during that period. The above rates may differ from the actual rates used in the
preparation of the historical consolidated financial statements and other financial information
appearing in this Offering Memorandum.

_Memorandum, including “Risk factors” and our consolidated financial statements and related_

_This summary contains forward-looking statements that contain risks and uncertainties. Our_

_In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments in the U.K. and in all European_

_countries in which we operate have implemented strict social distancing measures with varying_
_degrees of lockdowns and closures of non-essential businesses, including leisure facilities such as_
_ours. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented disruption to our business, and the_
_wide variations in potential outcomes present a material challenge to our business and our_
_industry. We took action early in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and we continue to take_
_every step that we believe is prudent to protect and manage our clubs, reduce our cost base and_
_protect our operating cash flows. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, it is not possible to_
_accurately predict the medium or long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business_
_and our industry, which will depend on factors outside of our control._

_other operating data as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the three months ended_
_March 31, 2021, which represents the impact on our business of the COVID-19 pandemic as the_
_majority of our clubs were closed during the First Lockdown and the Second Lockdown._

**Overview**

We are the leading premium lifestyle club operator in Europe based on revenue for the year

ended December 31, 2019. On a pro forma run-rate adjusted basis, pre-COVID-19 pandemic, we
had approximately 668 thousand members as of December 31, 2019. As of March 31, 2021 we
operated 99 clubs in the U.K., one club in the Republic of Ireland and 22 clubs in continental
Europe. Our mission is to provide high-quality destinations suitable for the whole family and all
age ranges with an emphasis on the quality of our offering and expert delivery of multiple products
and services, creating a sense of belonging and improving our members’ lives. Our clubs are places
for me-time, together-time, work, rest and play-time under one roof, improving the lives of our
members and providing a home away from home under our “My Club for My Life” ethos.

We differentiate ourselves from our competitors by blending our distinguished social

offerings with our market-leading sports and leisure facilities and fitness offerings, allowing us to


-----

cultivate a loyal and “sticky” membership base. Our club rooms and outdoor spaces encourage
member interaction and provide a social, destination environment where members can relax and
socialize in a vibrant setting. The breadth and quality of our offering allows us to attract and retain
members of all ages, including families and older demographics, whom we believe are more likely
to become long-term members because our clubs become an integral part of their lives. We believe
our distinctive family focus, with programs and services catered to the whole family, enhances
member engagement, promotes membership retention and differentiates us from our competitors.
We believe that we have maintained markedly lower attrition rates than our peers, with a prepandemic attrition rate of 32.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to up to
approximately 100% reported by certain low cost operators pre-pandemic (Source: public
_information), and the average membership tenure for our long-term members (i.e. those who had_
their membership for over 18 months) was seven years and our long-term members represented
63% of our member base, in each case, as of February 29, 2020 (excluding our Meridian clubs).
Based on the aggregate monthly membership fees paid by our long-term members for the month
February 2020, our aggregate implied recurring revenue over the seven year tenure would have
been approximately £1.9 billion. Our total membership subscription revenue, including joining
fees and administration fees, represented 78.2% of our total revenue for the year ended December
31, 2019. Our retail revenue generated by services such as our food and beverage offering,
childcare services and wellness products and our other revenue generated primarily by personal
training sessions and swimming and tennis tuition produce significant ancillary revenue and
represented 10.2% and 11.6%, respectively, of our total revenue in the year ended December 31,
2019.

Our business model focuses on operating a portfolio of strategically located clubs in

suburban areas, with each site situated in close proximity to an affluent demographic population.
Our clubs are well-invested and include heated indoor and outdoor pools, top-class racquet
facilities, well-equipped group exercise studios, state-of-the-art gyms, luxurious spas, crèches,
family-oriented club rooms and outdoor spaces, lounges with restaurants and bars as well as a fully
complementary digital offering, thereby delivering an outstanding customer experience to our
members. In addition, the range and breadth of services offered by our clubs results in longer
customer dwell-time, increased secondary spending, higher market penetration and improved
retention rates compared to our competitors.

While we operate mainly in the U.K., with 99 of our clubs located in the U.K. as of March

31, 2021, we see significant growth potential in Europe. Our recent acquisition of the eight
Meridian Group clubs in Germany has increased our penetration significantly into one of the most
important European markets. We expect to continue to consider additional international sites
through selective, value-enhancing strategic acquisitions of small portfolios as well as standalone
sites in Europe, in line with our overall growth plan. We believe that there are currently no
European competitors of significant scale in the premium health and fitness market segment, which
presents us an opportunity to capture additional market share through organic growth and
opportunistic acquisitions. The map below illustrates the location of our clubs:


-----

For the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated £519.5 million of revenue, a loss of

£51.5 million and £577.4 million of Pro Forma Run Rate Revenue with a Pro Forma Run Rate
Adjusted EBITDA of £170.9 million and Cash Conversion Ratio of 72.9%. We increased _Pro_
_Forma Run Rate Revenue, Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA and actual operating cash at_
a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 14.8%, 28.0% and 27.2%, respectively, from the
financial year ended January 3, 2016 to December 31, 2019.

**Our strengths**

**_Leading player in structurally attractive and growing U.K. and European health and fitness_**
**_club market with further growth expected post the COVID-19 pandemic_**

We are the leading premium lifestyle club operator in Europe based on revenue for the year

ended December 31, 2019, with 99 clubs in the U.K., one club in the RoI and 22 clubs in
continental Europe. The U.K. and European health and fitness club market in which we operate is
large and growing. We believe that this market is structurally attractive, particularly as the world
emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic. The total value of the U.K. health and fitness club market
increased from £4.3 billion as of December 2015 to £5.1 billion as of December 2019, reflecting
a CAGR of 4.4% (Source: LDC Report). Over this same period, the number of U.K. health and
fitness clubs grew from 6,312 to 7,239, reflecting a CAGR of 3.5%, while the number of health
and fitness club members grew from 8.8 million to 10.4 million, reflecting a CAGR of 4.3%
(Source: LDC Report). As of December 2019, 16% of the U.K. population, or approximately one
in six people, were a member of a health and fitness club (Source: LDC Report) and 11%, or
approximately one in ten people, were a member of a private health and fitness club. The total
value of the European health and fitness club market increased from €24.6 billion as of December
2015 to €26.2 billion as of December 2019, reflecting a CAGR of 1.6% (Source: Statista). Over
this same period, the number of health and fitness clubs in Europe grew from 51,204 to 63,644,
reflecting a CAGR of 5.6%.

We believe that growth in the U.K. and European health and fitness club market, including

a growth in penetration rates, is largely attributable to the increasing focus of consumers on health
and wellbeing and a growing awareness of the significant benefits of a healthy lifestyle. These


-----

same consumers also increasingly view health and fitness as an essential rather than discretionary
expenditure. Modest population growth, increases in consumers’ disposable incomes and
innovation and new technology in fitness may also have driven growth of the U.K. and European
health and fitness club markets over the past five years. We anticipate that demand for health and
fitness clubs will accelerate post-pandemic as the COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the benefits
of a healthy lifestyle.

We believe the COVID-19 pandemic is shaping trends that will benefit our industry over

the mid-term. With more people working from home, our members have greater flexibility to
spend more time at our clubs, which are predominantly located in suburban areas. According to
Barclays’ research, post-pandemic, white collar employees in the U.K. expect working from home
days to increase by 60% (to 1.6 days per week on average), while employers in the U.K. expect
working from home days to double (to 2.0 days per week on average) (Source: Barclays Research
_Work from Home: A Global Revolution Special Report). We believe that this trend is further_
supported by a long-term shift to experiential spend by our target demographics, with 35% of
people in the U.K. with no prior gym membership surveyed during April 2020 reporting that they
would consider buying a membership following the uplifting of COVID-19 restrictions, according
to research conducted by UKactive.

Our expectations for growth in the U.K. and European health and fitness club market post
pandemic present an opportunity for our business. As a result of market growth and recent healthfocused trends, we anticipate more members being able to join and spend time at our clubs.

**_A broad and highly differentiated offering that makes us more than just a gym which is_**
**_unmatched by any scale competitor_**

We offer our members a distinguished selection of facilities and services which we believe

are unrivalled in breadth and quality. In particular, we differentiate ourselves from our competitors
by blending our social and wellness offerings with our market-leading sports and fitness facilities,
thus cultivating a loyal and “sticky” membership base.

_Our social offering_

Our “clubiness” is a key to driving our social offering. We want our members to feel they

belong to their club rather than visiting solely for exercise and our vibrant club rooms and social
outdoor spaces are a key component of our offering which provide members with a destination
environment where they can relax and interact with each other. We pride ourselves upon our local,
and often member self-started, societies among our clubs, which build loyal communities centered
around common interests and create a distinctive “clubs with clubs” culture. We also organize
various bespoke social events to drive member engagement and retention, all of which are tailored
to meet the specific needs of our members. In addition, several of our training options, such as
tennis leagues and running and triathlon clubs, feature a strong social element to encourage
participation via group coaching and friendly competitions. Most of our clubs have lounges with
a restaurant service and licensed bar, which represents our largest source of ancillary revenue
(47.5% of ancillary revenue (including retail and other revenue) in the year ended December 31,
2019). Many of our outdoor pool areas also have a barbecue or other food and beverage service,
thereby creating a destination area in the summer months. We regularly update our menus in


-----

response to member feedback to maximize the appeal of our food and beverage offering and stay
in touch with our customers’ preferences.

Our clubs are open to all ages and have a distinctive family focus, with families and couples

representing approximately two thirds of our membership base as of March 31, 2021, leading our
clubs to become an integral part of the families’ lives. We believe that this offering enhances
member engagement, promotes membership retention and differentiates us from our competitors.
We believe, based on management estimates, that we are one of the largest U.K. child activity
providers, as we offer extensive facilities for children (who represented approximately a quarter
of our members as of March 31, 2021). These include daycare, crèches, structured activity
programs, kids play-frames, child-friendly tablets, dedicated splash pools and family friendly areas
such as soft play and DL Kids activity areas, family lounges and family changing rooms, with an
average of approximately 500 family classes every week and 38,500 kids enrolled in the swimming
and tennis lessons of our All Stars programs for children aged 3–11 during the year ended
December 31, 2019.

More recently, we have further expanded our social offering by introducing quiet spaces

within our clubs to allow members to work directly from our premises. Our dedicated adult-only
business lounges have been designed so that members are given sufficient flexibility to take
advantage of our facilities while tending to their professional duties, in line with the recent
working-from-home trend spurred on as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As an increasing
number of our members are choosing or needing to work from home, we seek to facilitate the
transition to a comfortable and reliable remote working environment by offering on-site spaces to
work from, thereby further strengthening our “clubiness.” As of March 31, 2021, all of our clubs
offered large and spacious lounges with complimentary WiFi access. In addition, we offer
dedicated adult-only lounges and business hubs in a select number of clubs.

_Our sports, fitness and wellness offering_

We believe we are one of the market leaders in privately-owned sports facilities in the U.K.

Our racquets, swimming and sports facilities are some of the highest quality in the market and are
accompanied by leading professional coaches. As of March 31, 2021, we operated 117 squash
courts and, based on management estimates, we operated approximately 36% of all indoor tennis
courts in the U.K. Further, as of March 31, 2021, we operated 196 indoor and outdoor pools across
the U.K. Our innovative group exercise programs, extensive studio facilities and state-of-the-art
gyms complement the full suite of our offering, helping us meet the varied needs of our members.
We believe group exercise is a significant driver of member retention, and have capitalized on this
trend by offering weekly 18,800 adult classes across all our clubs in the year ended December 31,
2019. We also offer extensive high-quality gym facilities, with an average of 120 pieces of gym
equipment per club as of March 31, 2021.

Our holistic approach to health includes what we believe to be market-leading wellness

offerings, which includes relaxing spa facilities, dedicated mind and body studios and a healthy
and nutritious menu. As of March 31, 2021, approximately 99% of our clubs included saunas,
steam rooms and jacuzzies. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we hosted approximately
2,500 mind and body classes every week. A select number of our U.K. clubs now include Spa
Retreats, which provides members with a high-end, luxurious wellness experience.


-----

Lastly, we are cognizant of the preference of some of our members to exercise from home,

and have bolstered our digital offering in order to keep our members engaged and connected during
the First Lockdown and the Second Lockdown. Our @home app is the flagship of our digital
offering and offers our members a weekly timetable of fitness classes and interactive events and
an extensive library of on-demand classes and tailored workout plans, all of which are designed
by our professional staff. The @home app also benefits from the integrated services of ancillary
service providers such as Boditrax and Myzone, which further reinforce our digital ecosystem. As
of March 31, 2021, our @home app had over 1,500 pieces of content, which were viewed 8.2
million times and used by approximately half of our members during the First Lockdown and the
Second Lockdown.

_No scale competitors with comparable offerings_

We offer a wide breadth of services and facilities that traditional gym groups and country

clubs do not match on a comparable scale, which reinforces our competitive advantage. Our
comprehensive club offering includes gyms, exercise and spinning studios, group exercise classes,
indoor and outdoor pools, saunas, steam rooms, jacuzzies, crèches, tennis courts with a range of
surface types, treatment rooms and squash courts. By contrast, most private clubs are only able to
provide a subset of our offering. For example, as of March 31, 2021, while 100% of our clubs had
dance studios, group exercise classes and indoor pools, private clubs that include those services
only amounted to 60%, 52% and 35%, respectively (according to management estimates). As of
March 31, 2021, approximately 99% of our clubs included saunas, steam rooms and jacuzzies,
while only 48%, 38% and 30% of private clubs included those same facilities, respectively
(according to management estimates). Moreover, while as of March 31, 2021, 90% of our clubs
included a crèche, 83% included a tennis offering and 73% included an outdoor pool, only 8%,
3% and 4% of private clubs featured those same services (according to management estimates).

We believe that our varied offering, including our outdoor facilities, tennis courts,

swimming pools, spas, restaurants, crèches and both live and on-demand workouts with our
@home app, allows us to stand out competitively within the premium segment of the market, and
that there are no scale competitors with a comparable offerings. The breadth of our offering as
compared with other private club operators is illustrated by the following chart:


-----

_(Source: Management estimates)_

**_Our scale and well-invested and strategically located club offering is difficult to replicate_**

_Catchment areas_

We believe that new entrants to the premium segment of the health and fitness club market

would experience difficulties in attempting to disrupt our strong presence and member base, both
in the U.K. and Europe. This is because significant capital, time, know-how and available land are
required to locate and develop a site that can be operated profitably. An attractive catchment area
is crucial for our clubs to be successful. As of March 31, 2021, according to management estimates,
there were only 39 target catchments in the U.K. that we had identified as suitable for the
development of a profitable club where we do not yet have a presence. The below charts illustrate
our current incumbency in the U.K. and the limited number of attractive target catchments where
we are not present:

David Lloyd’s incumbency Available sites


-----

Developing a profitable club requires finding a sufficiently affluent catchment area.

Against this background, we have a well-invested portfolio of premium locations throughout the
majority of affluent catchment areas in the U.K, which we believe are located in prime locations
and easily accessible by most of the population. As of March 31, 2021, based on management
estimates, 91% of our current members lived within a 20 minute drive of our clubs.

In addition, the significant capital requirements, time and know-how required to develop a

site, once located, present a significant investment cost to any new entrant. Our sites, from the
purchase of land to the fit-out of the club, cost approximately £13 million on average to develop.
To achieve a scale comparable to that of David Lloyd, we estimate that a potential new entrant
would need to invest over £1.5 billion over a significant period of time and with high execution
risk, while also having to source considerable know-how and devote a significant amount of time
to each site development project. We estimate that the full process from the initial scope (including
planning permission, detailed design, construction and fit out) to the opening of a site (including
membership ramp-up to the maturity of the site) would take a competitor six to seven years to
complete for each new club.

_Geographic diversification_

While our operations are primarily concentrated in the U.K., we also cover some of the

most affluent areas in some of Europe’s most important markets. Our European clubs in Italy,
Spain, Belgium and Germany are placed and marketed strategically to achieve affluent catchment
in some of Europe’s most affluent markets by Affluence Mix, as illustrated by the below chart:

We have substantially increased our market share in key European markets and we

currently have a presence in countries that represent more than 72% of the entire European market
(Source: Statista, 2020). We also have plans for further selective expansion via value-enhancing
strategic acquisitions. For example, our recent acquisition of eight clubs in Germany has increased
our penetration significantly into one of the most important European markets.

**_Loyal, affluent and diversified member base delivers resilient and recurring revenues_**

_Loyal_

We believe that our loyal customer base drives our recurring revenues. The average

membership tenure for our long-term members (i.e. those who had their membership over 18
months) was seven years and our long-term members represented 63% of our member base, in
each case, as of February 29, 2020 (excluding our Meridian clubs). Based on the aggregate monthly
membership fees paid by our long-term members for the month February 2020, our aggregate
implied recurring revenue over the seven year tenure would have been approximately £1.9 billion.
We believe we have one of the lowest attrition rates in the industry with a pre-pandemic attrition
rate of 32.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to up to approximately 100%
reported by certain low cost operators pre-pandemic (Source: public information). We believe that
our low attrition rates and the fact that a vast majority of our members join us with a 12-month
contract with a three-month notice period (providing us visibility and an opportunity to engage
with and convince leaving members before their contract ends) make us resilient to adverse market
conditions. Our high levels of retention drive a resilient and recurring revenue base with robust
levels of growth. The chart below shows the evolution of our total attrition relative to our total
number of new members between 2015 and 2019:

(1) Includes the 74 thousand members from the 14 Virgin Active clubs acquired in the in June 2017.

Our like-for-like membership growth has also been unaffected by annual price increases in

the last five years, which we believe is a testament to our member loyalty and our track-record of


-----

understanding our members, innovating our offering in line with our members’ needs, providing
excellent service and successful reinvestments into our estate to improve the quality and offerings
of our clubs. Our members pay premium value for premium quality.

Like-for-like membership growth

_Affluent_

Our membership base is generally affluent and diverse, which we believe makes it less

prone to economic downturns and recessions. In fact, as at November 2019, 58% of our members
had a household income of £60,000 or more as compared to only 18% of the U.K. population. The
below chart demonstrates that the Affluence Mix across our U.K. clubs is over indexed compared
to the national average, based on management estimates:

_Diversified_

We pride ourselves on the diversity of our membership base. As of March 31, 2021,

approximately two thirds of our membership was made up of families and couples. We also benefit
from diverse age demographics, with 50% of our members aged between 18 and 50, 24% under
the age of 18 and 26% over the age of 50 as of March 31, 2021. The breadth and quality of our
offering allows us to attract and retain members of all ages, including families and older
demographics, whom we believe are more likely to become long-term members because our clubs
become an integral part of their lives. As of March 31, 2021, children and individuals aged at least
50 comprised half of our membership base, as illustrated by the chart below:


-----

**_Consistent delivery of growth and strong cashflow generation_**

Our rapid topline growth, underpinned by new member sales and price increases and

combined with a disciplined approach towards cost control, allows us to drive substantial cash
generation. We were operating at all-time highs in revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and operating cash
flow prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, with strong underlying performance driven by multiple
levers. In particular, our membership subscriptions revenue grew at a CAGR of 12.4% between
the financial year ended January 3, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2019.

Between the financial year ended January 3, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2019,

our total revenue increased from £330 million to £520 million (£413 million on a like-for-like
basis), representing a 12.0% increase in CAGR (5.8% on a like-for-like basis), our EBITDA
increased from £65 million to £135 (£108 million on a like-for-like basis), representing a 19.9%
increase in CAGR (13.3% on a like-for-like basis) and our operating cash increased from £38
million to £99 million, representing a 27.3% increase in CAGR, in each case as illustrated by the
charts below:

Our impressive earnings growth and margin expansion prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,

which we believe will resume following the staggered reopening of our facilities at the end of the
Second Lockdown, is supported by a well-controlled cost base. We have also implemented new
cost saving initiatives. Our Fit For Growth Program implemented in December 2020 is expected
to yield approximately £10 million of annual labor cost savings from 2021 onwards compared to
our labor costs for the year ended December 31, 2019, following a full review of club structures,
duty manager shifts and benchmarking of departmental hours as well as an increased focus on
digital solutions to optimize our staff and overhead costs. However, while management’s


-----

disciplined approach towards cost control has made our substantial revenue growth visible at
Adjusted EBITDA level, with our staff costs, overheads, club support and rent costs growing at a
CAGR substantively below our revenue CAGR between the financial year ended January 3, 2016
and the year ended December 31, 2019, our primary focus remains on delivering a best in-class
service and outstanding customer experience for our members. Therefore, while cost discipline
remains important, it does not take precedence over delivering a high-quality experience for our
members.

**_Industry leading management team_**

Our management team has a deep wealth of experience and talent. Their track-record of

proven success places us in a position to expand upon our robust market position. Our Executive
Chairman, Glenn Earlam, joined us from Merlin Entertainments (formerly Tussauds), where he
was Managing Director of Midway Attractions. Mr. Earlam was responsible for a successful
cultural change at Tussauds and led the global rollout of Midway Attractions. Under Mr. Earlam’s
leadership, we have been focusing on a number of operational initiatives aimed at improving our
customer service delivery, lowering customer attrition and bolstering brand awareness. While at
Merlin Entertainments, Mr. Earlam worked with our Chief Executive Officer, Russel Barnes for
over 20 years. Mr. Barnes brings considerable transformation and rollout experience to the team.
Another key member of our team, Patrick Burrows joined us as Chief Financial Officer from
London City Airport where he oversaw the £2.4 billion sale of the business. Prior to London City
Airport, Mr. Burrows worked at New Look and Tesco. The current management team expanded
our footprint through strategic value-enhancing acquisitions and organic growth, including the
acquisition of 14 Virgin Active clubs in 2017 and the acquisition of eight Meridian clubs in
Germany, growing our number of clubs from 94 clubs in 2016 to 122 in 2021. Our team is rounded
out by a dedicated group of directors with over 60 years of tenure between them.

**Our strategy**

The core of our strategy is to continue to deliver sustainable, profitable growth by focusing

on creating a premium experience for our club members. With our well-invested estate and wide
product offering, we put our members at the heart of our proposition, enabling us to deliver yield
and growth. Through reinvesting our profits into our existing estate to deliver an ever-improving
member experience, we create a virtuous circle that is proven and sustainable, as illustrated by the
chart below:


-----

**_Listening to members_**

We want our members to feel like David Lloyd is their club. We have a sophisticated,

comprehensive and targeted member communications program in place, covering the duration of
a member’s lifetime with us to encourage a high level of engagement and to allow us to understand
the desires of our members. We emphasize the quality of our offering and expert delivery of
multiple products and services, and we focus on member engagement and a tailored
communication strategy in order to stay in touch with our members frequently and effectively. We
ask our members for feedback on a regular basis, with an average of approximately 15 thousand
pieces of feedback received weekly through feedback stations in our clubs and push notifications
received through our @home app after each member visit. In addition, we track our members’ club
visits and directly reach out to them when we notice a drop in attendance, which allows us to assess
each member’s particular needs, offer bespoke programs, demonstrate our strong commitment to
member satisfaction and altogether rekindle engagement. We believe that this model allows us to
closely stay in touch with our members’ needs and foster a unique sense of belonging within our
clubs.

**_Improving our product offering_**

Our members have a keen view on value for money. Our track-record has proven that our

members are generally willing to pay membership fees at a premium provided that the quality of
our product offering and their experience justifies this cost. We leverage the feedback and insights
received from our members by investing heavily in our clubs to deliver a premium and
differentiated product proposition. For example, we rolled out our Spa Retreats and grew the
number of Blaze studios across our estate based on membership feedback. Our facilities include
heated indoor and outdoor pools, top class racquet facilities, well-equipped group exercise studios,
luxurious spas, family-oriented club rooms and outdoor spaces, lounges with restaurants and bars,
high-quality gyms as well as a fully complementary digital offering. The success of our product
initiatives is evidenced by the increasing quality scores our facilities have received from members
based on our internal surveys, with the quality of our facilities being endorsed by 92% of our
members in 2019 compared to 73% in 2015.

**_Enhancing the quality of the service that we provide to our members_**

We focus on enhancing the quality of the services we provide to our members by ensuring

that our clubs are staffed with great personnel who are motivated and engaged with the business.
Accordingly, we will continue to select our staff carefully and invest in their training to deliver
consistent, high-quality service to our members. Every new staff member receives formal training
during which they learn about our clubs and our culture and receive bespoke training in customer
service to ensure they are capable of delivering the premium experience our members expect. We
also have ongoing training for our staff covering health and safety protocols, as well as an online
training academy from which all employees can access a variety of courses, including child
safeguarding and a wide range of technical training. Our personal trainers and coaches are selected
in accordance with strict standards in order to ensure that they can deliver up-to-date advice on
training, fitness, nutrition and lifestyle changes to our members. In recognition of the pivotal role
our employees play in executing our strategy and delivering premium member services, we pay
the majority of our staff at levels above minimum wage and provide them with a comprehensive


-----

benefits package, including a club membership that allows them to use our facilities and gain a
first-hand understanding of our members’ needs. Based on regular employee surveys, employee
engagement improved from 80.0% in 2015 to 94.4% in 2019. We also consistently rank on the
Sunday Times’ Top 25 Best Companies to work for in the U.K. list.

**_Increasing member satisfaction_**

The combination of our high-quality facilities and outstanding customer services allows us

to maintain and increase our members’ satisfaction, leading to our members becoming advocates
for our business, with our Net Promoter Score increasing from 22.0 in 2015 to 57.2 in 2019,
according to our own survey. We intend to deploy a number of new initiatives in order to keep our
members engaged and maintain consistently high satisfaction levels. Since the start of the COVID19 pandemic, we have deployed an extensive digital and social media strategy that enhances our
members’ experience and exploits the power of digital commerce. For instance, both our website
and @home app allow online booking of group classes, and we continue to focus on delivering
fully complementary digital solutions to our members. Our strategy to increase member
satisfaction also hinges on our “clubiness,” as we believe that members value our clubs as a place
to socialize in a family-friendly setting. We will continue to put the social scene at the core of our
offering by organizing a wide spectrum of social events at our clubs and ensuring that our
members’ needs are always taken into consideration.

**_Growing our membership base_**

Our strong and experienced sales team will continue to sell our high-quality offering which

is synonymous with the significant recognition of the “David Lloyd” brand in the markets in which
we operate. In order to increase our membership base, our sales process is organized to encourage
potential members to visit our clubs and experience the full range of our facilities and services,
rather than choosing a club based on price alone. Our sales and marketing activities are also
benefiting from our increasing focus on digitalization and the rollout of our @home app. In order
to cater for situations where prospective members are unwilling or unable to visit our clubs before
purchasing a membership, we now offer a digital joining process, which has generated
approximately £11 million in revenue from its inception to April 2021. We view digital and social
media as an important new channel of communication with prospective members, and this vision
has been further strengthened by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our social media
presence enables us to tailor our communications to each individual member based on factors such
as demographics and usage patterns, thereby enhancing the relevance of our member
communications and increasing each member’s engagement with their club. We will continue to
advertise our offering through a broad range of media platforms in the U.K., both nationally and
locally, including television, radio as well as all major social media platforms.

Our sales and marketing efforts have successfully increased our membership base at a

CAGR of 8.5% from 452 thousand as of 2015 to 626 thousand as of 2019 and at a CAGR of 2.5%
from 449 thousand as of 2015 to 496 thousand as of 2019 (on a like-for-like basis). Our
membership growth was achieved thanks to consistent net member gains during the same period,
with an average of 37.4 thousand net new members added each year between 2015 and 2019. In
addition, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had identified approximately ten of our clubs that
were approaching their maximum capacity, which indicates ample room for further growth of our


-----

like-for-like membership base. The charts below illustrate the growth of our total membership
base, net new members and average yield:

**_Confidently pricing membership fees_**

We will continue to collect feedback from our members and measure members’ satisfaction

with the quality and availability of our product offering and the prices paid for membership. Our
pricing strategy reflects our understanding, based on feedback, that our members are willing to
pay premium prices for a premium offering as members have acknowledged our investments in
our clubs and accepted price increases linked with improved quality and availability of our product
offerings and customer service. We generally announce price increases to our existing members
highlighting and reflecting investments that improve the facilities in their clubs. We
simultaneously update the membership fees for new members of the relevant clubs to reflect the
improvements at those clubs. Since 2016, we have delivered annual yield growth in excess of
annual retail price index (“RPI”) increases while continuously growing our membership base. In
addition, if based on certain capacity indicators, we identify clubs that are reaching their maximum
level of utilization, we implement price increases to manage the utilization levels at those clubs,
which allows us to generate further yield and EBITDA growth. For example, prior to the COVID19 pandemic, we had identified a small number of our clubs with limited excess parking or class
booking availability at peak times, and implemented price increases as demand for those clubs
exceeded availability. We intend to maintain our successful pricing strategy in order to continue
to deliver accretive and sustainable profit growth while continuing to increase our membership
base.

**_Reinvesting our growing profits_**

Enabled by our strong cash conversion, we will continue to reinvest our growing profits

into our estate in order to modernize, refurbish and expand our portfolio and thereby further
improve our product offering and enhance the quality of our services, which in turn drives
members’ satisfaction and yield growth, which can then be reinvested, creating a virtuous circle
that is proven and sustainable and which constitutes the basis of our strategy.

As our members value the quality of their clubs, we will continue to refresh and improve

our facilities with the latest, highest-quality offering and equipment. Capital expenditures are an
essential part of our strategy, and we have invested approximately £284 million into refurbishing
and transforming our clubs over the last six years. By October 2020, we had rolled out Spa Retreats
at a select number of clubs located in our most affluent catchment areas, which provide members


-----

with a high-end, luxurious wellness experience and deliver significant uplift in club Adjusted
EBITDAR. For example, we invested £3.6 million in the rollout of the Spa Retreat in our Royal
Berkshire club in the first half of 2019 and achieved a 31% return on investment with an increase
of £1.1 million in club Adjusted EBITDAR for the twelve months ended February 29, 2020 (based
on the club Adjusted EBITDAR for the eleven-month period April 2019 to February 2020, runrated for a twelve-month period), compared to the club Adjusted EBITDAR for the twelve months
ended prior to the investment of the capital expenditure. We have also been developing our free
weight capacity, adding more Olympic platforms on our gym floors and increasing the space in
our studios, and plan on bolstering our offering of onsite self-administered health products such as
cholesterol and DNA tests while also adding massage and stretching rooms to our clubs, offering
members a more bespoke fitness experience.

Historically, returns on Investment Capital Expenditure have been strong. Phase 1 of our

investment plan was completed in 2014 and comprised a £22.1 million investment into 18 clubs,
an average of £1.2 million per club. Phase 2 was completed in 2015 and comprised a £18.8 million
investment into 18 clubs, with an average of £1 million per club. Phase 3 was completed in 2016
and comprised a £32.4 million investment into 41 clubs, with an average of £800,000 per club. We
achieved a 43% return on investment from phase 1 with an increase of £9.5 million in club
Adjusted EBITDAR for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, a 42% return on investment from
phase 2 with an increase of £7.9 million in club Adjusted EBITDAR for twelve months ended June
30, 2017 and a 48% return on investment from phase 3 with an increase of £15.5 million in club
Adjusted EBITDAR for the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, in each case compared to the club

**_Expanding our footprint in the U.K. and in Europe via selective value-enhancing strategic_**
**_acquisitions_**

We have implemented a successful acquisition strategy since Glenn Earlam joined the

Group in 2015, pursuing value-enhancing investments which have granted us access to new
catchment areas and increased our membership base. We proactively manage our club portfolio
by pursuing value-enhancing strategic acquisitions of small portfolios as well as standalone sites
in Europe, in line with our overall growth plan.

Prospective acquisitions are consistently assessed according to strict investment criteria, as

we look for a demonstrated ability to deliver returns both on a standalone and an aggregate basis.
We seek locations in a catchment area that has a significant affluent target population within a 20
minute drive, ideally without a competing club in the catchment area. A detailed demographic
analysis of the catchment area allows us to calculate a potential membership number for the site
to determine maximum club size and potential profitability. We then produce a detailed model for
each new site, using assumptions based on local catchment area characteristics and similar clubs
from our existing portfolio. Our approach enables us to determine the layout, mix of facilities,
membership categories and pricing characteristics of each club on an individual basis.

Our value accretive greenfield expansions are generally assessed on a single site basis,

given the factors associated in finding a suitable catchment area for a premium club. The
economics of sale and leaseback transactions allow us to maximize our return on our Pipeline
Capital Expenditure spend on greenfield expansions by combining a one-off profit on the sale of


-----

the freehold of the club, with EBITDA generation by the club during our leasehold period. For
example, we spent approximately £13 million in Pipeline Capital Expenditure to develop our
Emersons Green club in 2018 and 2019, which was expected to generate a mature EBITDA of
£2.6 million per year, and in December 2020, we sold the site for a net consideration of £21.1
million, representing an immediate profit of approximately £8.1 million. Simultaneous with the
sale, we agreed with the buyer to lease the club for an annual rent cost of £1.1 million, generating
a mature club EBITDA of £1.5 million per year. We will endeavour to use cash on balance sheet
or a prudent mixture of equity and debt to finance any future acquisitions. In addition, we will
continue to use complex data-analytics to assess new opportunities, which has been a key to our
well-proven record of both successful acquisitions and organic openings.

While our operations are currently primarily concentrated in the U.K., we expect to

consider further international sites via selective, value-enhancing strategic acquisitions of small
portfolios as well as standalone sites in Europe, in line with our overall growth plan. In particular,
we see significant growth potential in our current offerings in Europe, having already identified
approximately 700 potential development sites across the continent. Our European clubs represent
a differentiated proposition in several European markets with affluent demographics and we
believe there are no competitors of scale in the premium segment of the health and fitness market.
Our recent acquisition of eight clubs in Germany has significantly increased our penetration into
one of the most important European markets. This acquisition also provides a blueprint for further
strategic and selective European expansion into markets with high membership growth potentials
and low penetration rates.

**_Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic_**

The First Lockdown

Prior to the First Lockdown, our business was performing on an upward growth trajectory,

with our latest annual price increase enacted in January 2020. Excluding the impact of the COVID19 pandemic, we generated £519.5 million of revenue, a loss of £51.5 million and £577.4 million
of Pro Forma Run Rate Revenue with a Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA of £170.9 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019. However, in March 2020, the governments of the U.K. and
of all European countries in which we operate imposed significant lockdown measures in order to
control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the temporary closure of almost all of
our clubs. During this First Lockdown, we decided not to charge members whilst their club was
closed, in line with our priority to retain members and treat them fairly. Consequently, almost all
of our revenue ceased until the phased reopening of our clubs in Europe starting from June 3, 2020
and in the U.K. on July 25, 2020. Approximately 44 thousand members canceled their membership
during the First Lockdown, and, in contrast with the pre-COVID situation, we sold very few new
memberships because our clubs were closed, resulting in unusually high levels of net member loss
over the second half and in particular the second quarter of 2020. We also recorded negative
Adjusted EBITDA from March 2020 to July 2020.

During the First Lockdown, we reacted swiftly to minimize our costs reducing our pre-lock

down monthly operating cash outflow by 86% from £37.7 million to £5.3 million, primarily due to
cash savings from furloughing staff (£50 million in aggregate across the First Lockdown and the
Second Lockdown) and deferred rent savings (£53 million in aggregate across the First Lockdown
and the Second Lockdown) as presented in the following chart:


-----

In addition to our costs saving initiatives, we focused on maximizing our members’

engagement and maintaining a dialogue with them. On March 23, 2020, we were one of the first
U.K. fitness, health and leisure operators to offer a remote exercise platform through the launch of
our “@home” mobile app. While memberships were frozen, we strove to keep our members
engaged with @home by offering them a weekly timetable of fitness classes and interactive events
and an extensive library of on-demand classes and tailored workout plans. Members used our
@home app not only for our signature fitness classes, but also for social events such as cooking
classes, quiz nights and make up tutorials. We also ensured that members who paid subscription
fees during months of partial closure were treated fairly by crediting their accounts with pro-rated
fees for the number of days we were closed. In addition, we kept an uninterrupted line of
communication with our members throughout the First Lockdown, giving them updates about our
reopening plans and new safety and hygiene protocols to be put in place in order to reassure them.
The success of our efforts to keep members engaged during the First Lockdown is evidenced by an
internal survey according to which 76% of them thought that the speed of communication was
“extremely good or very good” and 80.1% believed our implementation of government guidelines
was “extremely good or very good.” These high satisfaction rates served to reinforce our clubiness
and allowed us to minimize member loss during the First Lockdown to approximately 10% of our
total membership base, compared to approximately 27% for certain low-cost operators, according
to management estimates.

Following the reopening of the majority of our clubs in August 2020 after the First

Lockdown, we recorded our highest ever monthly new membership sales between August 2020
and October 2020, surpassing month-on-month 2019 sales in August by 70% (29.8 thousand new
members), in September by 59% (32.0 thousand new members) and in October by 57% (26.9
thousand new members) and our prior best sales month (January 2018) in August by 28%, in
September by 37% and in October by 15% evidencing the strong demand for our offering and
services. Furthermore, monthly new membership sales in November 2020 and December 2020
were also on track to exceed month-on-month 2019 sales prior to the announcement of the Second
Lockdown. The following chart illustrates the success of our membership sales following the First
Lockdown:


-----

The strong sales results of our clubs after the First Lockdown were recorded in spite of

fears of a looming Second Lockdown and the unavailability of vaccines at the time, which
demonstrates the appeal of our clubs where, in contrast to many of our competitors, we can
organize our activities outside and there is sufficient space to comply with social distancing rules
and COVID-19 protocols. After reopening in July 2020, based on an internal survey, our members
rated us 4.5 stars out of 5 stars for safety and wellbeing, which indicated our members and staff
felt comfortable coming back to our clubs.

Due to the recurring nature of our membership subscriptions revenue which we started

charging again upon reopening of our clubs after the First Lockdown, our business immediately
returned to profitability generating approximately £1 million, £7 million and £8 million of
Adjusted EBITDA in August, September and October 2020, respectively, as illustrated by the
following chart:

The Second Lockdown

On October 31, 2020, the U.K. Prime Minister announced a second national lockdown,

which came into effect on November 5, 2020 and required the temporary re-closure of all of our
English clubs until December 2, 2020. By January 5, 2021, all of our clubs in England were forced
to close again as a result of the Second Lockdown being reinstated, with other U.K. and European
clubs following a similar pattern of closures and reopening (with the exception of two clubs in


-----

Spain which remained open with certain operating restrictions). The chart below shows our total
number of clubs open throughout the First Lockdown and the Second Lockdown:

Consistent with our approach during the First Lockdown, club memberships in the U.K.

were frozen throughout the Second Lockdown, which led to our revenue almost ceasing during
this period. Our European clubs also generally followed the same approach. The higher number of
members leaving due to the closure of the majority of our clubs and the continued uncertainty
caused by the pandemic and our inability to sell new memberships, in contrast to pre-COVID-19
periods, resulted in a net member loss of approximately 51 thousand members during the Second
Lockdown. Based on our experience from the First Lockdown, we managed to minimize our
Adjusted EBITDA losses and cash burn during the Second Lockdown thanks to staff furloughs
and rent deferral negotiations.

April reopening

Following the Second Lockdown, the reopening of our clubs in England and Scotland has

been carried out on a staggered basis, with outdoor facilities reopening on March 29, 2021 and
indoor facilities reopening on April 12, 2021, followed by the full reopening of our Scottish clubs
on April 26, 2021. Based on recent government announcements, we anticipate the rest of our clubs
in Europe will start reopening from May 2021. Since the staggered reopening of our facilities at
the end of the Second Lockdown, our business has been performing very well. We believe that
this is partly because the more affluent segments of the population are relatively less impacted by
the COVID-19 pandemic and increased household saving rates are supporting a sustained period
of increased leisure spending. Our strong performance during April and May was also driven by
the fact that, as of March 31, 2021, 38% of our adult members were eligible for a vaccine jab on
the basis of age alone, and for those members who have elected to receive the vaccine it was safer
to return to our clubs, which was evidenced by this group accounting for 42% of attendance during
April 2021, despite making only 28% of our member count as of March 31, 2021. As of April 30,
2021, members who were 40 years and older were eligible for a vaccine jab, representing 60% of
our adult members. Furthermore, the suburban location of our clubs is allowing us to leverage the
new working-from-home trends, as members now have greater flexibility to visit our clubs during
the entire day, rather than at the usual pre- and post-working hours peak periods we used to observe
prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and some members are working from our clubs in
our business lounges.

In addition, we believe that certain trends spurred on by the COVID-19 pandemic are likely

to bolster demand for our clubs, as travel restrictions in Europe will force households to look for
domestic leisure centers during the summer of 2021, while the potential closures of some of our
weaker competitors’ facilities will reduce overall market supply and correspondingly increase
demand for our services. Furthermore, research on the retail, consumer and leisure sectors from
Strategy& suggests that 80% of adults surveyed in the U.K. expect to be mindful or more mindful
about practicing regular self-care post-pandemic.


-----

Our strong bounceback since the end of the Second Lockdown is evidenced by record new

membership sales, with 36.4 thousand new members added in April 2021 compared to 18.1
thousand new members in April 2019 at “normal” trading levels, representing an increase of 101%,
which led to a net member gain of approximately 27 thousand in April, while only 77% of our
clubs were open as of March 31, 2021 and only 84% of our clubs were open by the end of April
2021. We also recorded approximately 45 thousand new member sales between May 1 and May
31, 2021 compared to 18 thousand new members between May 1 and May 31, 2019, representing
an increase of approximately 150%. We believe that our new membership sales are likely to
continue to increase in the coming months as more clubs reopen and with key drivers of our
offering such as indoor group exercise, kids soft play, our indoor food and beverage offering and
sauna and steam rooms having resumed from May 17, 2021, allowing us to return to full capacity
in the U.K., while our European clubs also begin to reopen. Based on May 2021 levels, web traffic
(up 127.0% compared to March 2021) and web enquiries (up 218.8% compared to March 2021)
demonstrate a strong pipeline for June and July. Based on our all-time high new membership sales
and the pipeline data collected since the staggered reopening of our facilities at the end of the
Second Lockdown, we aim to reach our pre-pandemic membership base of 668 thousand members
by September 2021. The following chart illustrates our cumulative new membership sales since
March 1, 2021:

Many of our members canceled their membership during the First Lockdown and the

Second Lockdown and because our clubs were closed, we sold very few new memberships, in
contrast to normal pre-COVID-19 periods, as a result of which we had a net member loss of
approximately 94 thousand members between February 2020 and February 2021. However, our
strong recovery in membership numbers since the staggered reopening of our facilities has allowed
us to recoup more than a third of these lost members in the months of March and April 2021, while
16% of our clubs had yet to reopen as of the end of April and the further relaxation of social
distancing measures in the U.K. expected to generate a further increase in membership growth, as
our indoor group exercise, kids soft play, indoor food and beverage and wellness offering have
resumed from May 17, 2021. The following chart illustrates our strong recovery in membership
numbers since February 2021:


-----

The rapid bounceback of our membership numbers is expected to be further aided by lower

than normal attrition rates expected in the period June to September 2021 as 18% fewer members
have handed in a notice to terminate their membership as of May 31, 2021 compared to the same
position in 2019, and 22% fewer members lost during the same period compared to the 2019
position, as illustrated by the charts below:

Attrition pipeline as at 31[st] May Attrition as at 31[st] May

We expect our attrition levels in the next twelve months to remain lower compared to

normal pre-COVID-19 levels as a result of the lower sales during 2020, because historically an
element of our attrition is due to members cancelling their membership after the first year of joining
David Lloyd.

Our usage data since the end of the Second Lockdown is a further indicator of our strong

bounceback. Our average club usage from April 12, 2021 to May 30, 2021 was 28.4% higher than
it was following the reopening of our clubs at the end of the First Lockdown, which is testament
to the increasing appeal of our offering to members and increased consumer confidence. Since the
indoor facilities reopening on April 12, 2021, we have recorded an overall member attendance of
70.7%, with 70.2% of our adult membership base having attended our clubs.

Due to the recurring nature of our membership subscriptions revenue which we started

charging again when our clubs reopened, the clubs that reopened immediately returned to
profitability. As a result, we expect our EBITDA to be positive again for May 2021.

**_Liquidity update_**

As of June 30, 2021 on an _adjusted basis for the Transactions, including the Equity_

Contribution, we expect to have available liquidity of £259.0 million, assuming £134.0 million in


-----

cash and cash equivalents (£20 million to £30 million of which will be specifically earmarked for
value-enhancing strategic acquisitions of small portfolios as well as standalone sites in Europe,
which, if successful, could take place over the course of 2021) and £125.0 million in undrawn New
Revolving Credit Facility commitments available for drawing. See “Capitalization.”

Following the Transactions, we believe we will have ample liquidity to manage the further

reopening of our clubs in the U.K. and in Europe and to implement our planned capital expenditure
for the year ending December 31, 2021, or, alternatively, a further wave of the COVID-19 virus
and related restrictions. Under our current modelling and in light of the current status of reopening
in the countries in which we operate, we estimate that we will have £195 million to £220 million
of available liquidity as of December 31, 2021. For more information about the risks associated
with the impact of subsequent waves of the COVID-19 virus and lockdowns, see “Risk factors—
_The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and will continue to adversely impact, our_
_business, financial position and results of operations.” The chart below compares our projected_
_pro forma liquidity as of June 30, 2021 with our projected liquidity post-deferred payments as of_
December 31, 2021:

(1) The projections included in the chart are based on estimates and assumptions made as of the end of May 2021, which assume 50% of
our European clubs re-open in June 2021, with the remainder to open in July 2021, and remain fully open until December 31, 2021. We
have also assumed recovery of member count to 668,000 by September 2021. By their nature, projections are forward-looking statements
that involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events, depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future and
are based on a number of assumptions that are themselves subject to inherent uncertainties and risks.

(2) The liquidity shown includes cash and undrawn commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility. The chart assumes cash on
balance sheet as adjusted for the Transactions as of an assumed Issue Date of £134 million, £20 million to £30 million of which will be
specifically earmarked for value-enhancing strategic acquisitions of small portfolios as well as standalone sites in Europe.

(3) New Revolving Credit Facility assumed to be undrawn and available for the period.

(4) The chart assumes £31 million of net cash interest, exceptionals, taxes and New Revolving Credit Facility commitment fees for the
period between June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2021.

**The Transactions**

The Transactions consist of the following:

  - the issuance by the Issuer of the Notes and the use of proceeds thereof;

  - the Internal Reorganization;

  - the payment of fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing transactions,
including the fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Offering; and

  - any other transactions in connection with any of the above or incidental thereto.

**Principal shareholder**

The Issuer is a wholly owned direct subsidiary of the Company, which is indirectly

controlled by funds managed or advised by TDR Capital LLP (“TDR Capital”).

TDR Capital LLP is a leading private equity firm that managed funds of up to €10 billion

of assets under management as at the end of 2020 and is based in the U.K. It was founded in 2002
by Manjit Dale and Stephen Robertson, who were previously partners at DB Capital Partners. TDR
Capital LLP has an experienced team of investment professionals and operating partners and has
a low-volume investment strategy based on principles developed by the investment team over the
past decade. TDR Capital LLP seeks to spend significant resources on each investment and to
focus on operational excellence through a tested and integrated operating partner model.

Intense pre-investment analysis and post-investment involvement mean that TDR Capital

is selective, typically making only one to three investments a year. TDR Capital takes an active
role in overseeing the operations of its investments, working in partnership with management
through board representation and professional support.

TDR Capital has been a longstanding supporter of the business, having acquired the

Company in 2013. It has since supported the management team on its growth journey in
transforming the business into one of Europe’s leading health & leisure club operators, enabling
us to record growth in revenue and member count of 81.1% and 54.9%, respectively, between
2013 and 2019, and growing our EBITDA at a CAGR of 15.6% between 2014 and 2019 (in each
case on a pro forma run rate adjusted basis). In addition, under TDR Capital’s ownership, we have
spent £380 million of capital expenditures on our estate since 2013. TDR Capital’s capital
contribution to the Meridian Group of approximately €80 million represents its most recent
commitment to the Company’s continued success. To date, TDR Capital LLP has completed 22
investments across the leisure, consumer, business and financial services sectors. Some examples
of current and prior TDR Capital investments include Hurtigruten, ASDA, Euro Garages, Pizza
Express and Stonegate Pub Company.

In connection with the Transactions, TDR will inject £100 million into the Company as

part of the Equity Contribution.

               - be secured by the Collateral as set forth below under “—

_Collateral,” along with the obligations of such Guarantor_
under the New Revolving Facilities Agreement, any
Hedging Obligations and any Operating Facility (as
defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) (although any
liabilities in respect of obligations under the New
Revolving Facilities Agreement and any Hedging
Obligations that are secured by the Collateral will receive
priority over the holders of the Notes with respect to any


-----

proceeds received upon any enforcement action over the
Collateral);

               - rank _pari passu in right of payment with all of such_

Guarantor’s existing and future indebtedness that is not
subordinated in right of payment to the such Guarantor’s
Guarantee;

               - be senior to all existing and future indebtedness of such

Guarantor that is subordinated in right of payment to such
Guarantor’s Guarantee;

               - be effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured

indebtedness of such Guarantor to the extent of the value
of the Collateral that is available to satisfy the obligations
under the Guarantee; and

               - be subject to the guarantee limitations described herein.

The Guarantees will be subject to contractual and legal
limitations, and may be released under certain

circumstances. See “Description of the Notes—Guarantees”
and “Risk factors—Risks related to our financial profile, the
_Notes and the Guarantees.”_

**Collateral.................................** No later than the Issue Date, subject to the release of the
guarantees and security securing the Group’s existing
financing arrangements and to the Agreed Security Principles
and certain applicable perfection requirements, the Notes and
the Guarantees will be secured by the following collateral (the
“Closing Date Collateral”):

               - limited recourse English law share charge over all shares

in the Company; and

               - English law security assignment over any structural

intercompany loans from Deuce ParentCo Limited to the
Company.

No later than two business days from the Issue Date, subject
to the Agreed Security Principles and certain applicable
perfection requirements, the Notes and the Guarantees will be
secured by an English law debenture over certain material
assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors (including the
Company) that are incorporated in England, including first
fixed equitable security over any leasehold interests other
than any leasehold interest that has 35 years or less to run,
subject to receipt of landlord consent (if required) (the “Post


-----

_Closing Date Collateral” and together with the Closing Date_
Collateral, the “Collateral”).

The Collateral will also secure the obligations of the Issuer
and the Guarantors under the New Revolving Facilities
Agreement, any Hedging Obligations and any Operating
Facility. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement
(as defined herein), any liabilities in respect of the New
Revolving Facilities Agreement and any Hedging Obligations
that are secured by the Collateral will receive priority with
respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action
over such Collateral.

The Agreed Security Principles will apply to the granting of
security in favor of obligations under the Notes. The Agreed
Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of
security where, among other things, such grant would be
restricted by applicable law, general statutory limitations,
financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference
or “thin capitalization” rules or similar matters or where an
action would conflict with fiduciary duties of directors,
contravene any legal or regulatory prohibition or result in a
risk of personal or criminal liability on the part of directors or
officers and also limit the granting of security to the Security
Jurisdictions (as defined in the Agreed Security Principles).
See “Description of other financial arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement.”_

The security interests in the Collateral may be released under
certain circumstances. See “Risk factors—There are
_circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the_
_Notes under which the Collateral securing the Notes and the_
_Guarantees will be released automatically and under which_
_the Guarantees will be released automatically, without your_
_consent or the consent of the Trustee,” “Description of other_
_financial arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and_

Euro Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount
of the Euro Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption, plus the


-----

applicable “make-whole” premium, as described in this
Offering Memorandum.

On or after , 2022, the Issuer may redeem some or all of the
Euro Notes at the redemption prices set forth under the
caption “Description of the Notes—Optional redemption—
_Optional redemption of the Euro Notes,” plus accrued and_
unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of
redemption.

_Sterling Notes ..........................._ Prior to , 2023, the Issuer may redeem some or all of the
Sterling Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the Sterling Notes redeemed, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of
redemption, plus the applicable “make-whole” premium, as
described in this Offering Memorandum.

On or after , 2023, the Issuer may redeem some or all of the
Sterling Notes at the redemption prices set forth under the
caption “Description of the Notes—Optional redemption—
_Optional redemption of the Sterling Notes,” plus accrued and_
unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of
redemption.

Prior to , 2023, the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of the
Sterling Notes (including the aggregate principal amount of
any additional Sterling Notes issued) with the net cash
proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption
prices set forth in this Offering Memorandum, plus accrued
but unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of
redemption, _provided that at least 50% of the original_
principal amount of the Sterling Notes (not including any
additional Notes issued) remains outstanding.

Prior to , 2023, the Issuer may redeem up to 10% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Sterling Notes originally
issued (including the aggregate principal amount of any
additional Sterling Notes issued) in each twelve-month period
commencing on the Issue Date at a redemption price equal to
103% of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of
redemption.


**Optional redemption for tax**
**reasons .....................................**


In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the
Issuer may redeem the Notes of any series in whole, but not
in part, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the


-----

date of redemption. See “Description of the Notes—
_Redemption for Taxation Reasons.”_

**Change of control ...................** Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change
of control, the Issuer may be required to offer to repurchase
all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to
101% of the principal amount redeemed on the date of
purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but
excluding, the date of purchase. However, a change of control
will not be deemed to have occurred if certain consolidated
leverage ratios are not exceeded in connection with such an
event. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

**Further Issuance of Notes ......** Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer will be
permitted to issue additional Notes. Additional Notes shall be
treated, along with all other notes issued under the Indenture,
as a single class for the purposes of the Indenture with respect
to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not
specifically distinguished for such series. For all purposes
other than U.S. federal income tax purposes, additional Notes
shall be deemed to form one series with any notes previously
issued under the Indenture if they have terms substantially
identical in all material respects to such other notes. In the
event that any additional Notes issued after the date hereof
and sold pursuant to Rule 144A are not fungible with any
notes previously issued under the Indenture for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, such non-fungible additional Notes
shall be issued with a separate ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP
or other securities identification number, as applicable, so that
they are distinguishable from such previously issued notes
under the Indenture. Additional Notes sold pursuant to
Regulation S from time to time may be issued with the same
ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification
number as the applicable series of notes previously issued
under the Indenture without being fungible with such series
of notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If you are a
U.S. holder (as defined in “Certain tax considerations—
_Certain United States federal income tax considerations”)_
considering the purchase of Notes sold pursuant to Regulation
S as part of this offering of Notes or in the secondary market,
you should consult your tax advisors concerning the
particular U.S. federal income tax consequences to you of the
purchase, ownership and disposition of such Notes, including
with respect to the potential issuance of additional Notes that
are not fungible with the applicable series of initial Notes
issued under the Indenture for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, but which nevertheless are not capable of being


-----

separately identified. In the event additional Notes are issued
pursuant to Regulation S that bear the same ISIN, Common
Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as
Notes belonging to the same series previously issued, without
being fungible with such series of initial Notes for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, Book-Entry Interests in the
Regulation S Global Notes that form part of that series,
including in respect of investors that hold Book-Entry
Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on or prior to the
date of issuance of such additional Notes, will not be eligible
for transfer to Book-Entry Interests in a Rule 144A Global
Note (if any) representing Notes of that same series. Such a
restriction could adversely impact the liquidity of sales of
Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes. See
“Risk factors—Risks related to our financial profile, the Notes
_and the Guarantees—Additional Notes sold pursuant to_
_Regulation S may not be fungible with existing Notes for U.S._
_federal income tax purposes,” “Book-Entry, delivery and_
_form—Transfers” and “Description of the Notes—Additional_
_Notes.”_

**Additional amounts ................** Any payments made by the Issuer, the Successor Company
(as defined herein) or any Guarantor with respect to the Notes
will be made without withholding or deduction for or on
account of taxes unless required by law. If the Issuer, the
Successor Company or the Guarantors are required by law to
withhold or deduct amounts for or on account of tax imposed
by the United Kingdom (or certain other relevant taxing
jurisdictions) with respect to a payment to the holders of the
Notes, the Issuer, the Successor Company or the relevant
Guarantor will, subject to certain exceptions, pay the
additional amounts necessary so that the net amount received
by the holders of the Notes after the withholding or deduction
is not less than the amount that they would have received in
the absence of the withholding or deduction. See “Description
_of the Notes—Additional Amounts.”_

**Certain covenants ...................** The Indenture that will govern the Notes and the Guarantees
will contain covenants that, among other things, limit our
ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:

               - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;

               - pay dividends or make other distributions or purchase or

redeem our stock;


-----

               - make investments or other restricted payments;

               - enter into agreements that restrict our restricted

subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends;

               - transfer or sell assets;

               - engage in transactions with affiliates;

               - create liens on assets to secure indebtedness;

               - impair security interests; and

               - merge or consolidate with or into another company.

Each of these covenants is subject to significant exceptions
and qualifications. See “Description of the Notes—Certain
_covenants.”_

**Use of proceeds .......................** The proceeds of the Notes, together with the proceeds from
certain other equity financing transactions described herein,
will be used (i) to repay existing indebtedness, (ii) for general
corporate purposes, including working capital requirements,
capital expenditures and strategic acquisitions, and (iii) to pay
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
Transactions. See “Use of proceeds.”

**Transfer restrictions;**
**no registration rights .............** The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be
registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws
of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction. We
have not agreed to, or otherwise undertaken to, register the
Notes or the Guarantees. The Notes will be subject to certain
other restrictions on transfer as described under “Transfer
_restrictions.”_

**No prior market .....................** The Notes will be new securities for which there is currently
no market. Although the Initial Purchaser has informed us that
it intends to make a market in the Notes, it is not obligated to
do so and it may discontinue market-making at any time
without notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a
liquid market for the Notes will develop or be maintained.

**Listing ......................................** Application will be made to the Authority for the listing of
and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the
Exchange. There can be no assurance that the Notes will be
listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such


-----

permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that such
listing will be maintained.

**Summary historical consolidated financial and other data**

**Financial statements presented**

**_Financial information of the Issuer and the Company_**

The Issuer is a newly formed entity incorporated on May 6, 2021 for purposes of facilitating

the Transactions and performing certain activities related thereto. The Issuer is a wholly owned
direct subsidiary of the Company. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer has no
revenue-generating activities of its own, and no business operations, material assets or liabilities
other than those acquired or incurred in connection with its incorporation and the Transactions. As
a result, no historical financial information of the Issuer is included in this Offering Memorandum.

The Company was incorporated on May 18, 2018 as a holding company. The Company is

indirectly owned by HoldCo. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Company has no
revenue-generating activities of its own, and no business operations, material assets or liabilities
other than (i) certain existing indebtedness which will be repaid with the proceeds of the
Transactions (see “Use of proceeds”) and (ii) a £2.0 million annual monitoring fee paid to HoldCo.
As a result, no historical financial information of the Company is included in this summary.

**_Historical Financial Information of Holdco_**

The consolidated historical and other financial data presented in this summary have been

derived from (i) the audited consolidated financial statements of HoldCo as of and for the period
from January 4, 2018 to December 31, 2018 and as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019
and 2020, including the accompanying notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with
IFRS and which have been audited by Deloitte LLP and (ii) the unaudited condensed consolidated
interim financial statements of HoldCo as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2021,
including accompanying notes thereto (with comparable financial information for the three months
ended March 31, 2020), which have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial
Reporting, in each case included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. References to the
“Group,” “us” or “our” in the context of historical financial information or other financial
information relate to HoldCo and its subsidiaries. The audit reports for the period from January 4,
2018 to December 31, 2018 and as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020,
included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, express an unqualified opinion for each of the
respective periods and the audit report in relation to the audited consolidated financial statements
for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 include a material uncertainty paragraph related
to going concern as set forth in Note 2 to such financial statements.

IFRS 16 (Leases) was published on January 13, 2016 by the International Accounting

Standard Board. It became effective on January 1, 2019 and applies to the first full financial year
commencing on or after that date. Our first full financial year following the effective date of IFRS
16 began on January 1, 2019, and we applied the modified retrospective approach of adopting the
new standard, which did not require a restatement of comparative results for the financial period
ended December 31, 2018. On adoption of IFRS 16, the Group recognized lease liabilities in
relation to leases which had previously been classified as “operating leases” under the principles
of IAS 17. These liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments,


-----

discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate as of January 1, 2019. The weighted
average lessee’s incremental borrowing rate applied to the lease liabilities on January 1, 2019 was
6.8%. For leases previously classified as “finance leases,” the carrying amount of the lease asset
and lease liability immediately before transition were recognized as the carrying amount of the
right-of-use asset and the lease liability at the date of initial application. For more information on
the adoption of IFRS 16 and the adjustments made in relation thereto, see “Management’s
_discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations—Factors affecting_
_comparability of our results of operations—Adoption of IFRS 16” and Note 33 to the HoldCo_
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, we identified that both deferred tax asset

balances and reserves had been understated by £21 million as of December 31, 2019. As a result,
we have restated the consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2019. The
Group adopted IFRS 16 Leases retrospectively from January 1, 2019, but did not restate
comparatives for the 2018 reporting period, as permitted under the specific transition provisions
in the standard. The adjustments arising from the new leasing rules were therefore recognized in
the opening balance sheet on January 1, 2019. There were no errors related to the adoption of IFRS
16 itself. The error was restricted to the deferred tax calculation. The misstatement of the deferred
tax balances related to the complexities of the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases retrospectively from
January 1, 2019. There is no impact on the consolidated income statement for the year ended
December 31, 2019 and the effect on the consolidated statement of financial position as of
December 31, 2019 was to increase the opening January 1, 2019 deferred tax assets by £21 million
and to reduce accumulated losses as of January 1, 2019 by £21 million.

Our consolidated financial statements include the results of operations and financial

position of HoldCo, which are not attributable to the Company or its subsidiaries. As a result, the
consolidated financial statements of HoldCo are not directly comparable to the historical financial
information of the Company and its subsidiaries, which is prepared in accordance with IFRS. The
main differences between the consolidated financial position and results of operations of HoldCo
and the Company (i) as of and for the period from January 4, 2018 to December 31, 2018, related
to interest income in relation to shareholder loans from HoldCo to its direct and indirect
shareholders and cash on balance sheet held under HoldCo’s name, which amounted to £2.3
million and £1.0 million, respectively, and a shareholder loan from HoldCo to the Company which
amounted to £5.9 million; (ii) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, related to the
balance of a shareholder loan from HoldCo to its shareholder and cash on balance sheet held under
HoldCo’s name, which amounted to £2.1 million and £1.5 million, respectively, and £0.2 million
additional finance cost incurred by the Company in relation to interest paid on a £5.3 million
shareholder loan from HoldCo to the Company; (iii) as of and for the year ended December 31,
2020, related to the balance of a shareholder loan from HoldCo to its shareholder and cash on
balance sheet held under HoldCo’s name, which amounted to £2.2 million and £1.4 million,
respectively, and £0.1 million additional finance cost incurred by the Company in relation to
interest paid on a £5.9 million shareholder loan from HoldCo to the Company; (iv) as of and for
the three months ended March 31, 2020, related to the balance of a shareholder loan from HoldCo
to its shareholder and cash on balance sheet held under HoldCo’s name, which amounted to £2.1
million and £1.5 million, respectively, and a £5.7 million shareholder loan from HoldCo to the
Company and (v) as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2021, related to the balance of a
shareholder loan from HoldCo to Deuce TopCo Limited and cash on balance sheet held under


-----

HoldCo’s name, which amounted to £2.2 million and £1.4 million, respectively, and a £6.0 million
shareholder loan from HoldCo to the Company.

As such differences are not material, the financial and operating results and certain other

information relating to HoldCo have been presented in this Offering Memorandum in lieu of the
Company. We believe that HoldCo’s consolidated financial statements, subject to the differences
noted above, adequately reflect the Company’s consolidated financial results and financial position
for the applicable periods.

**Non-IFRS measures**

We have included certain non-IFRS financial measures in this Offering Memorandum.

Non-IFRS financial measures are derived on the basis of methodologies other than IFRS and the
non-IFRS measures we present may also be defined differently than the corresponding terms under
the Indenture.

Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA, Cash Conversion Ratio, Pro Forma Run Rate

Adjusted EBITDA and _Pro Forma_ Run Rate Revenue to assess our operating performance.
Adjusted EBITDA is considered the key measure of profitability. It is considered by management
to be the supplemental measure to understand the underlying trading and financial performance of
our business and is the measure used to report to both the board and external lenders. In addition,
we believe these metrics are measures that are useful to investors. Adjusted EBITDA, Cash
Conversion Ratio, Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Run Rate Revenue are
not presentations made in accordance with IFRS, and our use of such terms varies from others in
our industry. These metrics should not be considered as alternatives to revenue, profit/(loss),
operating profit/(loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS as
measures of operating performance or operating cash flows as measures of liquidity, and Adjusted
EBITDA and Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA do not necessarily indicate whether cash
flow will be sufficient or available for cash requirements. Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Run
Rate Adjusted EBITDA have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider
them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under IFRS. Adjusted
EBITDA and _Pro Forma_ Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA may not be indicative of our historical
operating results nor are they meant to be predictive of potential future results.

Such non-IFRS financial information has not been audited or reviewed by Deloitte LLP.

**Adjusted financial information**

We also present below certain unaudited adjusted consolidated financial information of

HoldCo, including adjusted cash and cash equivalents, adjusted interest expense, adjusted net debt
and adjusted total debt and leverage and coverage ratios. Such measures reflect the following:

  - _Adjusted cash and cash equivalents is cash and cash equivalents adjusted for expected_
ordinary course movements in our cash and cash equivalents between March 31, 2021
and June 30, 2021, based on management estimates, including revenue generated and
expenses and interest paid in such period. Adjusted cash and cash equivalents assumes a
cash position of £30.3 million prior to the Transactions taking effect, in each case, as of


-----

June 30, 2021 and based on management estimates. Actual amounts may vary from
estimated amounts. Adjusted cash and cash equivalents is adjusted to give effect to the
repayment of the existing indebtedness from the estimated cash available on the balance
sheet as of June 30, 2021 and the expected proceeds of the Offering of the Notes and the
Equity Contribution available for general corporate purposes, including £20 million to
£30 million which is earmarked for strategic value-enhancing acquisitions, which, if
successful could take place over the course of 2021 (see “Use of proceeds”) and includes
the cash position of DLL Greenwich Limited and its subsidiaries, including the Meridian
Group, following the Internal Reorganization.

  - _Adjusted interest expense is interest expense adjusted for the effect of the Transactions,_
as if they had occurred on January 1, 2019 and assumes the New Revolving Credit Facility
was undrawn.

  - _Adjusted net debt is adjusted total debt less adjusted cash and cash equivalents._

  - _Adjusted total debt is our current and non-current loans and borrowings adjusted for the_
effect of the Transactions, as if they had occurred on March 31, 2021 and including £3
million (euro equivalent) of Meridian Spa & Fitness Deutschland GmbH indebtedness
following the Internal Reorganization and excludes the PIK Instrument, as the PIK
Instrument will be incurred at HoldCo outside the Restricted Group.

Such adjusted measures are not financial measures defined in accordance with IFRS and,

as such, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Such adjusted financial information has not been audited or reviewed by Deloitte LLP. As

all companies do not calculate these financial measures in the same manner, the presentation of
each financial measure may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other
companies. The unaudited adjusted consolidated financial information has not been prepared in
accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act, the Prospectus
Regulation or any generally accepted accounting standards. The unaudited adjusted adjustments
are based upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe to be reasonable.

The unaudited _adjusted consolidated financial information has been provided for_

informational purposes only. Results indicated by certain of these measures may not be realized,
and funds depicted by certain of these measures may not be available for management’s
discretionary use if such results are not realized. Further, the unaudited _adjusted consolidated_
financial information does not purport to indicate our future consolidated results of operations or
our cash position or financial position as at any future date. The actual results may differ
significantly from those reflected in the unaudited adjusted financial information for a number of
reasons, including, but not limited to, differences in assumptions used to prepare the unaudited
_adjusted financial information._

The unaudited adjusted consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction

with the information contained in “Presentation of financial of financial and other information
_and use of non-IFRS financial information,” “Selected historical consolidated financial data,”_
“Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations,” “Risk

our right-of-use assets and £54.8 million in respect of additional interest expense on lease liabilities, partially offset by a £70.7 million decrease
of other operating expenses as a result of the reclassification of our operating lease rent that was treated as an operating lease charge under
IAS 17 prior to the adoption of IFRS 16.

(1) The impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 excluding deferred tax on our consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2019,
comprised (i) an increase in total assets of £669.5 million comprising the recognition of right-of-use assets in an amount of £883.1 million,
partially offset by the de-recognition of £204.7 million of finance lease assets and a reduction in intangible assets of £8.9 million resulting
from the de-recognition of the lease assets below market rent and (ii) an increase in total liabilities of £582.6 million comprising £827.7
million in respect of lease liabilities, partially offset by the de-recognition of £26.2 million of non-cash rental accruals, £170.5 million of
finance lease liabilities and £48.4 million of provisions related to onerous lease contracts and leases above market rent.

(2) Restated. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we identified that both deferred tax asset balances and reserves had been understated by
£21 million as of December 31, 2019. As a result, we have restated the consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2019.
The Group adopted IFRS 16 Leases retrospectively from January 1, 2019, but did not restate comparatives for the 2018 reporting period, as


-----

permitted under the specific transition provisions in the standard. The adjustments arising from the new leasing rules were therefore recognized
in the opening balance sheet on January 1, 2019. There were no errors related to the adoption of IFRS 16 itself. The error was restricted to the
deferred tax calculation. The misstatement of the deferred tax balances related to the complexities of the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases
retrospectively from January 1, 2019. The effect on the consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2019 was to increase
the opening January 1, 2019 deferred tax assets by £21 million and to reduce accumulated losses as of January 1, 2019 by £21 million.

activities instead of operating activities.

(2) The data in this column represents the data as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, adjusted for (i) the annualized effect of our price
rises implemented in January 2020 and (ii) the full period impact of the Meridian Group, which we acquired in January 2020, adjusted for our
estimate of the expected impact of our extensive refurbishment works and improvements of the Meridian clubs.

(3) The European countries in which we have members include the Netherlands, Spain, Belgium, Ireland, Germany, France, Switzerland and
Italy.

(4) Like-for-like average monthly yield is calculated by dividing the membership fees charged as part of our membership subscriptions revenue
(excluding joining fees and administration fees) during a period by the average member count for such period and by dividing the result
thereof by 12. We do not present like-for-like average monthly yield for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the three months ended March
31, 2020 and 2021 because our membership fees were frozen for a significant part of such periods due to the COVID-19 pandemic, while our
average member count did not substantially fluctuate during such periods. We therefore believe that like-for-like average monthly yield for
the year ended December 31, 2020 and the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021 is not representative of what our like-for-like average
monthly yield would have been if we had not frozen our membership fees during such periods.

(5) Membership subscriptions revenue as a percentage of total revenue represents our revenue derived from members’ subscription fees and
administration and joining fees divided by our total revenue.

(6) Attrition rate is calculated by dividing the number of members that terminated their membership during a period by the total number of

**The adjusted financial information presented below, which is designed to present a**

**view of certain select metrics after giving effect to the Transactions, has been derived as of**
**March 31, 2021 and for the year ended December 31, 2019 rather than as of and for the**
**twelve months ended March 31, 2021, which is the most recent twelve-month period. We**
**believe that these metrics for the year ended December 31, 2019 more accurately represent**
**our operating and financial performance in a steady state of business. In response to the**
**COVID-19 pandemic, mandatory closures of our clubs were imposed in the U.K. and all of**
**the European countries in which we operate during the First Lockdown and the Second**
**Lockdown, as a result of which almost all of our revenue ceased until the phased reopening**
**of our facilities thereafter. Accordingly, between March 20, 2020 and August 2020, we did**
**not conduct any significant trading activity. For that reason, the year ended December 31,**
**2019 was our last full trading period that was not impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and,**
**we believe, the financial information for the year ended December 31, 2019 more accurately**
**represents our operating and financial performance in a steady state of business than the**
**financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021. Investors should be**
**cautioned that the metrics for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021 would have been**
**significantly different. See “Summary—Recent developments” for a description of our**
**current liquidity position and our liquidity profile, see “Capitalization” for our debt and cash**
**positions as of March 31, 2021 and also “Risk factors—Risks relating to our financial**

**Risk factors**

_Participating in the Offering and investing in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. You_

_should carefully consider the following risks, together with other information provided to you in this_
_Offering Memorandum, in deciding whether to invest in the Notes. The risks and uncertainties_
_described below are not the only ones we are facing. The occurrence of any of the events discussed_
_below could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If_
_these events occur, the trading prices of the Notes could decline, and we may not be able to pay all_
_or part of the interest or principal on the Notes, and you may lose all or part of your investment._
_Additional risks not currently known to us or that we now deem immaterial could also adversely_
_affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or our ability to fulfill our obligations_
_under the Notes and may affect your investment. Further, to the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic_
_has already adversely affected our business and its results of operations, it may also have the effect_
_of heightening many of the other risks described in this section._

_This Offering Memorandum contains “forward-looking” statements that involve risks and_

_uncertainties. Our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-_
_looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include those discussed below and_
_elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Please see “Forward-looking statements.”_

**Risks relating to our business and industry**

**_The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and will continue to adversely impact, our_**
**_business, financial position and results of operations._**

In late 2019, a new strain of coronavirus was detected in Wuhan, China. In March 2020,

the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and governmental
authorities around the world implemented measures to reduce the spread of the COVID-19
pandemic. These measures have included imposing restrictions on international travel and closing
borders to all non-essential travel, business closures, social distancing, national and regional
restrictions (including curfews and other lock-down measures) as well as quarantine requirements.
These measures have adversely affected workforces, consumer sentiment, economies and financial
markets, and, along with decreased consumer spending and widespread uncertainty following
months of lockdowns, have led to an economic downturn in all of the countries in which we
operate.

In March 2020, the governments of the U.K. and of all European countries in which we

operate imposed significant lockdown measures in order to control the spread of the COVID-19
pandemic, including the temporary closure of almost all of our clubs (the “First Lockdown”).
During the First Lockdown, we decided not to charge members whilst their club was closed, in
line with our priority to retain members and treat them fairly. Consequently, almost all of our
revenue ceased until the phased reopening of our clubs in Europe starting from June 3, 2020 and
in the U.K. on July 25, 2020. Many of our members also canceled their membership during the
First Lockdown, resulting in unusually high levels of net member loss over the second half of 2020,
with approximately 44 thousand members leaving David Lloyd during this period.


-----

On October 12, 2020, the U.K. Prime Minister announced a three-tiered system of

restrictions across England (the “Tiered System”) which came into effect on October 14, 2020. On
October 14, 2020, Liverpool and a number of other cities in the Merseyside area were placed in
Tier 3. Under the baseline for Tier 3 restrictions, clubs could be closed pursuant to “additional
measures” imposed by national or local government, as was the case in the Merseyside area. While
clubs could remain open where Tier 1 and Tier 2 restrictions applied, there can be no guarantee
that, in the event the Tiered System is re-implemented in the future, this would continue to be the
case or that more stringent rules and restrictions would not be applied in a manner that could
materially adversely impact our business. Additionally, under the Tiered System, local authorities
in England were given the power to impose stricter rules and restrictions in addition to those
imposed by the national government, with the potential to further materially adverse our business
and industry. During the period in which the Tiered System was in place, many of our clubs were
located in Tier 2 or Tier 3 areas. Under the Tiered System, Tier 2 areas could rapidly become Tier
3 areas and, likewise, Tier 1 areas could rapidly become Tier 2 or Tier 3 areas, and these
movements were fluid and outside of our control. The Tiered System applied only to England,
while the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had the power to
design and implement their own restrictions, including stricter restrictions than in England. Even
though the Tiered System was subsequently replaced by the Second Lockdown (as defined herein),
the Tiered System, or another set of comparable or more stringent restrictions, could be put in
place in the future.

On October 31, 2020, the U.K. Prime Minister announced a second national lockdown,

which came into effect on November 5, 2020 and required the temporary re-closure of all of our
English clubs (the “Second Lockdown”) until December 2, 2020. By January 5, 2021, all of our
clubs in England were forced to close again as a result of the Second Lockdown being reinstated,
with other U.K. and European clubs following a similar pattern of closures and reopening (with
the exception of two clubs in Spain which remained open with certain operating restrictions).
Consistent with our approach during the First Lockdown, club memberships in the U.K. were
frozen throughout the Second Lockdown, which led to our revenue almost ceasing during this
period and a correlated spike in attrition levels caused by approximately 94 thousand members
leaving David Lloyd during this period, with our European clubs also generally following the same
approach. Following the Second Lockdown, the reopening of our clubs in England and Scotland
has been carried out on a staggered basis, with outdoor facilities reopening on March 29, 2021 and
indoor facilities reopening on April 12, 2021, followed by the full reopening of our Scottish clubs
on April 26, 2021. The rest of our clubs in Europe are expected to start reopening fully from May
2021, however, we cannot assure you that the reopening will not be conditioned or delayed or that
further lockdowns will not be put in place.

During the First Lockdown and the Second Lockdown, we relied on access to government

aid and mitigation programs. Through negotiation with landlords, we were able to minimize cash
outlays by deferring certain rent payments, amending rent review mechanisms and extending leases
in exchange for the write-off of certain rental payments in arrears. Our mitigation strategy was
reinforced by legislation such as the UK Coronavirus Act 2020 and the UK Corporate Insolvency
and Governance Act 2020, which introduced certain protections in relation to lease forfeitures,
restrictions on the use of commercial rent arrears recovery and temporary restrictions on the ability
of creditors to file statutory demands and winding up petitions in the U.K. based solely on the failure
to comply with rent payment obligations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot provide


-----

any assurance that during any subsequent waves of the COVID-19 pandemic and/or any subsequent
lockdowns, such government aid, mitigation programs, negotiations with landlords and/or
protective legislation will be available to the same extent as in the past or at all and, if this were the
case, our cash outlay levels would be significantly higher during any subsequent waves than they
were in the previous waves. In the event that government support was unavailable, or available on
a more limited basis only, we would be forced to rely solely on our ability to pause capital
expenditures, implement cost reduction measures and defer payments, which could significantly
reduce our overall ability to mitigate cash burn. Likewise, we cannot provide any assurance that we
will be able to defer payments to the same extent as in the past or at all. Furthermore, payment
deferrals, on rent in particular, create future obligations towards our creditors, and our cash outlays
will increase when the deferred payments become due. We have £35.1 million of deferred payments
due from June 30, 2021 to December 31, 2021 with an additional £45.2 million of deferred
payments due to be settled in 2022.

Our newly reopened clubs in the U.K. and Europe now follow detailed governmental

guidelines in order to maintain social distancing and to increase sanitation and hygiene. These
include extensive cleaning protocols and other policies implemented in an effort to avoid the spread
of the COVID-19 pandemic, all of which may impact the operation and member appeal of our clubs.
For example, members unaccustomed to waiting significant periods of time before using certain
exercise equipment, or to increased cleaning periods, may cancel their membership. Furthermore,
in all of our indoor facilities, members over the age of 12 will be required to wear masks when not
exercising, which may deter members from attending our clubs and lead them to cancel or suspend
their membership. While we believe that our operations are currently in compliance with applicable
guidance, if customers perceive our implementation of these measures to be inadequate or
ineffective, we may suffer damage to our reputation, which could have a significant adverse effect
on our business. Even when social distancing policies are lifted, interest in visiting our clubs may
remain weak due to health concerns or changes in exercise preferences in favor of at home, online
or on-demand platforms. This will affect both current and prospective members, and may lead to
increased levels of attrition. We cannot predict when or if each of our clubs will return to preCOVID-19 membership levels or if they will be able to maintain pre-COVID-19 membership levels
and pricing terms over the mid- to long-term. We also cannot predict whether member cancellation
rates will be higher in subsequent lockdowns than they were during the First Lockdown and the
Second Lockdown. Additionally, policies implemented to slow the spread of the COVID-19
pandemic have impacted and will continue to impact our cost of doing business due to, among
others, the increased cost associated with hygiene measures and track and trace programs.

Although we have taken extensive measures to protect our members and employees, we

cannot be certain that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the health risks posed by the
COVID-19 pandemic, and we may be subject to litigation as a result of members or employees who
contract, or believe they have contracted, the virus at our clubs. We may also be subject to potential
litigation initiated by employees alleging that we have facilitated an unsafe working environment
or have increased their exposure to the virus. Additionally, we may be at risk of litigation following
a possible outbreak at one or a number of our clubs, which may cause us to incur further significant
costs and may have a negative impact on our reputation. Although recent vaccine approvals have
raised hopes of a turnaround in the pandemic in 2021, renewed waves and new variants of the virus
pose concerns for the global economic outlook and continue to exacerbate the risks posed by the
COVID-19 pandemic and may result in further lockdowns or other restrictive measures that may


-----

impact our operations. For example, in April 2021, the U.K. recorded an increasing number of
cases of the Indian COVID-19 variant, and a surge in these cases may cause the U.K. government
to reconsider its approach regarding the contemplated easing of lockdown restrictions.

We cannot guarantee that the fitness industry will ever return to the norms, lifestyle and

club attendance patterns that existed before the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further
social distancing measures, governmental lockdowns and curfews may be implemented across the
U.K. and Europe and have a materially detrimental impact on our business, financial condition and
results of operation. Our business is sensitive to reductions in discretionary spending by consumers,
public health events and other factors described in this “Risk factors” section. To date, the COVID19 pandemic has caused, and is continuing to cause, significant disruption in economic activity
globally, which could lead to a decline in discretionary spending by our members. Our revenue may
be negatively impacted by the adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate,
including higher unemployment rates and declining income and personal wealth levels resulting
from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our revenue may not increase in proportion to our fixed and deferred
costs, and it may not be sufficient to offset the full impact of the shutdown of our clubs during the
First Lockdown and the Second Lockdown. If our cost base is higher than our revenue, our cash
management policies may fail due to factors beyond our control.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business will ultimately depend on a

number of factors that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, including the duration (and the
extent of any resurgence in the future) and severity of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the threat
posed by new variants and the discrepancies of the vaccination efforts across the world. There are
no comparable recent events that provide us with guidance, and so we cannot currently estimate
this with any certainty, nor can we provide any assurance that the COVID-19 pandemic will not
continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. The adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition
and results of operations may also have the effect of heightening other risks described in this “Risk
_factors” section. If the industry in which we operate is fundamentally changed by the COVID-19_
pandemic in ways that are detrimental to us, our business may continue to be adversely affected
even as the pandemic abates and the broader economy begins to recover.

**_Legal, political and economic uncertainty surrounding the exit of the U.K. from the EU_**
**_(“Brexit”) may be a source of instability in international markets, create significant currency_**
**_fluctuations, and adversely affect our clubs._**

Whilst the U.K. officially exited the EU on January 31, 2020, the legal status quo from

before January 31, 2020 continued during a so-called “transition period” during which the U.K.
and the EU negotiated the terms of the separation and any future trade deal. This transition period
ended on December 31, 2020. On December 24, 2020, the U.K. and the EU announced that they
had agreed a new trade and cooperation deal (the “Trade and Cooperation Agreement”) governing
certain aspects of the future relationship between the U.K. and the EU. The Trade and Cooperation
Agreement was formally approved by the U.K. parliament on December 30, 2020 and applies
provisionally from January 1, 2021. It is currently expected to be formally ratified by the EU
parliament by April 30, 2021. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement provides guidance in respect
of the intended shape of the future relationship between the U.K. and the EU and some detailed
matters of trade and cooperation. However, there remain uncertainties related to Brexit and the


-----

relationship between the U.K. and the EU which will continue to be developed and defined and
could cause instability in the EU, U.K. or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market
conditions. Any Brexit-related effects are likely to be compounded by the effects of the COVID19 pandemic. See “—The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and will continue to
_adversely impact, our business, financial position and results of operations.”_

Due to the size and importance of the U.K. economy, the uncertainty and unpredictability

concerning the U.K.’s legal, political and economic relationship with the EU after the U.K. exits
the EU may continue to be a source of instability in the international markets, create significant
currency fluctuations, and/or otherwise adversely affect trading agreements or similar cross-border
cooperation arrangements (whether economic, tax, fiscal, legal, regulatory or otherwise) for the
foreseeable future.

The long-term effects of Brexit will depend on the evolution of any agreements (or lack

thereof) between the U.K., the EU and those third countries with which the U.K. currently enjoys
tariff-free access. Brexit is likely to impact the legal rights and obligations of commercial parties
across all industries, including health and fitness. Given the high correlation between demand on
the one hand, and economic growth and stability in the markets generating such demand on the
other hand, there is a risk that Brexit, other political developments or developments otherwise
affecting market confidence could negatively impact consumer behavior and, consequently, the
demand for our services. Changes in health and safety laws and regulations, as well as volatility
in food, drink and energy prices, in each case as a result of Brexit, could also adversely impact our
ability to smoothly operate our clubs.

We are based in the U.K. and as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, approximately

19% of our clubs were located in the EU. Lower levels of economic growth and changes in the
macroeconomic environment in the U.K. or in the European countries in which we operate as a
result of Brexit could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

**_Our geographic concentration heightens our exposure to adverse regional developments._**

Our geographic concentration in the U.K., in the Southeast of England and London in

particular, heightens our exposure to adverse developments in these areas, including those related
to negative political and economic trends, demographic changes, competition or other unforeseen
events that reduce consumers’ ability or willingness to spend. For instance, an uncertain economic
outlook as a result of an unforeseen event in London, whether related to Brexit (as defined herein)
or not, could materially and adversely affect consumer spending habits in those regions, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The health, fitness and leisure industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we may_**
**_fail to compete effectively._**

The health, fitness and leisure industry is highly competitive and fragmented, with several

large operators operating on a local, national or international level and smaller operators providing
services in their local areas. We operate in the premium segment of the health, fitness and leisure
industry in the U.K. and Europe. While this market segment has few players of considerable scale,
the mid-market and value segments of the health, fitness and leisure industry in the U.K. and


-----

Europe are highly competitive. As a result of the increasing number of value clubs in the U.K. and
Europe, we may face increased competition from this segment of the market, especially since the
operators of such value clubs likely charge lower membership prices than us or are able to gain
access to significant amounts of capital to enable them to rapidly build new sites. The appeal of
the value segment of the market may be magnified as a result of the economic disruption created
by the COVID-19 pandemic, with discretionary spending tightening. Additionally, there is a risk
that traditional value and mid-market health and fitness club operators may change their models
or create premium brand alternatives in order to more effectively compete with us.

We compete with many other businesses, including gym operators, tennis clubs, physical

fitness and recreational facilities established by local non-profit organizations, governments,
hospitals, local salons, cafés, exercise studios, golf and other athletic clubs, country clubs, online
personal training, fitness coaching, the home fitness equipment industry and businesses offering
similar ancillary services to ours. Nonprofit organizations and local authorities in our markets may
be able to obtain land and construct clubs at a lower cost and may be able to collect membership
fees without paying taxes or receive preferential tax treatment, thereby allowing them to
potentially charge lower prices. In addition, because we do not have exclusive rights to many of
the elements that comprise our in-club experience and service offering, competitors may attempt
to copy or improve on our business model, or portions thereof, which could erode our competitive
position, market share and brand recognition and have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Individuals wishing to exercise have a wide variety of options available to them other than

using purpose-built health and fitness facilities. These include outdoor activities such as cycling,
running and group exercise programs, team sports, weights, personal training, fitness apps or other
online programs at home (including Peloton), participation in which increased considerably during
the temporary closure of traditional facilities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our inability
to stay competitive by constantly anticipating and responding to the competitive factors affecting
our industry, including the introduction of new products, services or pricing policies by our
competitors, changing consumer preferences and regional and local economic conditions, could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We may have to lower our prices or increase our expenditure to maintain our market share.

Due to the inherent risks associated with advertising and new product introductions, including
uncertainties about consumer response, increased expenditure may not prove successful in
maintaining or enhancing our market share and could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Changes in the general economic climate and consumer preferences could have a detrimental_**
**_impact on our revenue._**

Our business is affected by changes in general economic conditions that impact consumer

confidence and discretionary spending. Our business, financial condition and results of operations
have been, and in the future may be, adversely affected by negative political and economic trends
and developments that reduce consumers’ ability or willingness to spend. In a depressed economic
and consumer environment, individuals and businesses may postpone spending in response to
factors such as negative financial news, higher unemployment, tighter credit, declines in income


-----

or asset values, increases in fuel and other energy costs, and conditions in the residential real estate
and mortgage markets. Reductions or delays in consumer spending could have a material negative
effect on the demand for our services and products. These risks are exacerbated by the fact that the
outlook for the U.K. and European economies remains highly uncertain in light of the impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our success is dependent on the continuing popularity of health and fitness in the countries

in which we operate, and the popularity of premium clubs in particular. Although we believe that
consumers increasingly view health and fitness as an essential rather than discretionary
expenditure, customers may still reduce their health and fitness spending in response to an actual
or perceived reduction in discretionary spending power. Alternative forms of fitness or venues for
fitness may become popular and trends in the type of clubs that consumers wish to join may change
in the future, especially as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Consequently, deterioration of general economic conditions in the U.K. or in the European

countries in which we operate, as well as demographic shifts in these markets, could materially
and adversely affect consumer spending habits, which in turn could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The success of our business depends on our ability to attract and retain club members, while_**
**_maintaining sustainable and profitable membership fees._**

As of May 31, 2021, we had approximately 632 thousand members and we had

approximately 45 thousand new member sales between May 1 and May 31, 2021. Our success is
dependent on our ability to attract and retain members to our clubs, as our revenue is mainly
generated from membership subscriptions revenue representing 78.2%, 78.2% and 80.4%,
respectively, of our total revenue for the periods ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020. As a
result, we must continually engage with existing members and attract new members in order to
maintain or increase our club membership levels. Our customers can usually terminate their
membership within one to three months’ notice once the initial term of their contract has expired,
and can also terminate their membership prior to the expiry of their contract’s initial term for a
number of reasons, including medical condition and changes in personal circumstances. We
believe, based on internal data, that most of our members typically maintain their membership
beyond the initial term of their contract, but we experience material member attrition, including
certain members who abandon their contracts before the term has expired, and we must therefore
continually engage existing members and attract new members in order to maintain our
membership levels and ancillary sales. Our inability to attract and retain club members could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

There are numerous factors that could lead to a decline in membership levels or ancillary

sales in mature clubs, or that could prevent us from increasing membership and ancillary revenue
at newer clubs where membership is generally not yet at targeted levels. These factors include
changing desires and behaviors of consumers, changes in discretionary spending trends and general
economic conditions, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business (See “—
_The negative impact of COVID-19 on our business is significant and its effects will continue to_
_materially negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations due to_
_many factors, some of which are beyond our control”), the indirect local competition from_


-----

premium and other health and fitness club operators, the saturation of local health and fitness club
markets, harm to our reputation or brand, a decline in our ability to deliver a high-quality service
to our members, the increasing popularity of home fitness equipment (including Pelotons), fitness
applications and other online exercise programs, the increasing popularity of studio clubs,
freelance personal trainers and outdoor fitness activities, a decline in the public’s interest in health
and fitness and changes in the level of positive referrals from current and former members caused
by any of the aforementioned reasons. Lastly, to the extent our corporate clients are adversely
affected by negative economic conditions, they may decide, as part of expense reduction strategies,
to curtail or cancel club membership benefits provided to their employees.

There is a direct correlation between our ability to attract and retain club members and the

membership and joining fees we charge. Specifically, we are dependent on our ability to charge
membership and joining fees at a level that allows us to attract and retain members while also
generating an appropriate fee yield relative to our costs. We use flexibility on a club-by-club basis
in order to carefully vary our membership and joining fees to adapt to the local demographics and
varying levels of affluence of the areas in which we operate. While we have been able to
successfully increase our membership fees in the past without it resulting in an increase of our
attrition rates, we may not be able to do so in the future and our ability to increase such fees to offset
potential costs without suffering membership decline is limited, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In order to continue to attract and retain members, we have to be able to respond to

consumer sentiment and consumer preferences, which may change rapidly and as a result of forces
outside of our control. If we fail to identify, anticipate and respond to such changes quickly, we
may lose a significant number of members. The challenges we face in attracting and retaining club
members are bolstered by the fact that our clubs target families as a whole rather than individuals
alone. As a result, it is harder to adjust our offering, and memberships are often canceled in bulk.
A decline in membership levels, membership and joining fees and profitability as a result of any
of the above factors, individually or in aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may incur rising costs related to the maintenance of our existing clubs and construction of_**
**_any new club, and if we are unable to identify and acquire suitable existing clubs or acquire and_**
**_develop sites for any new clubs, or if we are delayed in any new club opening or not able to pass_**
**_these cost increases through to our members, the operating results of our business may be_**
**_adversely affected._**

Our clubs require significant upfront and ongoing investment. Existing clubs require

ongoing maintenance and refurbishment expenditure to maintain the quality of our facilities and
offer our members the latest high-end exercise equipment. We are also likely to incur increased
operating expenses or capital expenditures in relation to our properties in order to comply with
applicable COVID-19 related regulations as well as members’ expectations relating to measures
to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

If we wish to grow our business through acquisitions, we will face risks related to

identifying appropriate targets, conducting effective due diligence and integrating the acquired
businesses in a timely fashion in order for any acquisitions to be accretive to earnings over the


-----

long-term. Additionally, we may be exposed to unexpected costs or liabilities resulting from
acquisitions which may not be covered by contractual representations and indemnities. If we
choose to grow our business through the development of new clubs, we will face a number of
challenges and risks. For example, we must identify and acquire sites of sufficient size with the
right demographic and other measures we employ in our selection process. We also need to
evaluate the penetration of our competitors in that market. We face significant competition (both
within and outside the health and fitness industry) for sites that meet our criteria, and as a result
we may lose those sites, or we could be forced to pay significantly higher prices for those sites. If
we are unable to identify and acquire sites for new clubs, our revenue growth rate and profits may
be negatively impacted. In addition, if our analysis of the suitability of a site is incorrect, we may
not be able to recover our capital investment in developing and building the new club.

Opening new clubs requires significant upfront investment, and a new club typically takes

approximately one year of full operations to break even, and even as we open new clubs our
underlying performance, including Adjusted EBITDA, is reduced by these losses. Upon opening
a new club, we typically experience an initial period of opening losses as the club builds its
membership base and due to the initial expense of pre-opening costs, which include legal and other
costs associated with lease negotiation and permitted use requirements, as well as depreciation and
amortization expenses. For example, we opened two new clubs between 2018 and 2020 by way of
greenfield expansions at our Acton Park and Emersons Green locations, which generated an
average loss of Adjusted EBITDA of £0.4 million. These operating losses and lower margins could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Additionally, the amount of the investment made in the opening of a new club may

materially change from the amount we have budgeted. Because of the larger average size of our
racquet clubs and because we tend to own rather than lease our clubs, our overall costs of
constructing any new club tend to be higher than our competitors’, particularly those operating in
the low cost and mid-market segments. If our actual investment in a particular club is higher than
we had planned, we may need to outperform our operational plan to achieve our targeted return.
In the event that operational performance is worse than we had initially planned, we may not be
able to achieve our targeted returns on investment. In addition, it has been our experience that
opening a new club in the catchment area of an existing club may result in some members being
detracted from the other club already operated by us, thereby diminishing that club’s revenue. If
we are unable to implement, integrate and manage our expansion plans successfully or if we are
unable to manage the risks associated with new club openings, our business, financial condition
and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, in the process of
constructing or opening new clubs, we or our agents may breach relevant local laws and
regulations, which could subject us to fines, loss of permits, licenses or approvals to implement
and operate the relevant project, and/or other penalties.

New club openings are also subject to the risk of delays. These are caused by the need to

obtain planning consents from local authorities, if not already in place, as well as shortages of
materials or skilled labor, labor disputes, construction issues and modifications in design. If we
are significantly delayed in opening new clubs, our competitors may be able to open new clubs in
the same market or improve clubs currently open before we open ours. This change in the
competitive landscape could negatively impact our pre-opening sales of memberships and increase
our investment costs. Our ability to open new clubs on schedule depends on a number of factors,


-----

many of which are beyond our control. These factors include obtaining acceptable financing for
construction of any new site, obtaining permits and licenses necessary to complete construction of
any new club on schedule, recruiting, training and retaining qualified management and other
personnel, securing access to labor and materials necessary to develop and construct our clubs,
delays due to material shortages, labor issues, weather conditions or other acts of God, discovery
of contaminants, accidents, deaths or injunctions and general economic conditions.

In addition, we may decide to close an underperforming club and attempt to move members

of that club to a different location, or we may have to temporarily relocate members if a club is
closed for refurbishment or due to fire or other reasons. As a result of these factors, membership
levels might not be adequate to maintain or permit the expansion of our operations and a decline
in membership levels could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_If we are unable to renew or replace our club leases or enter into leases for new clubs on_**
**_favorable terms or if any of our current leases are terminated prior to the expiry of their stated_**
**_term and we cannot find suitable alternate locations, our growth and profitability could be_**
**_harmed._**

We currently lease on a short-term basis approximately 55.7% of our club locations. These

leases expire between 2023 and 2056. Our leases provide for rent reviews, generally annually, at
which time our rents could increase and many of our leases contain upwards-only rent reviews.
Our ability to maintain our existing rental rates during renewals or to renew any expired lease on
favorable terms will depend on many factors that are not within our control, such as conditions in
the local real estate market, competition for suitable properties and our relationships with current
and prospective landlords. We have made certain assumptions about future rent reviews in respect
of our properties. If rent reviews were to be agreed at rates higher than currently anticipated, there
would be an adverse impact on the operating results of our business.

In addition, there is a risk that the leases may not be renewed in due course or at all due to,

among other factors, the state of the real estate market at such time and the competition for rental
space. If this risk materialized, we would have to identify and secure sufficient replacement sites
that meet our selection criteria. This would result in additional costs being incurred in selecting
appropriate or equally suitable alternative premises and relocating to them. Furthermore, we face
competition, typically, from other health and fitness club operators as well as other potential
occupants for suitable sites and, as a result, we may be unable to secure those sites at all, or we
could be forced to pay significantly higher rents or prices for those sites. If we are unable to identify
and secure sufficient replacement sites, or if we are forced to pay significantly higher rents for
those sites, such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_We are generally unable to terminate our property leases for a specified time period from the_**
**_start of the lease and we may be obliged to pay rent and pay losses if we close a location._**

The majority of our leases do not provide a right for us to terminate the lease before the

end of the lease term, whether through the exercise of tenant-only break rights or otherwise. In
circumstances where we are unable to terminate our property leases, we may not be able to sublet


-----

or assign our leases on commercially acceptable terms or at all. Accordingly, if we close a club
prior to being able to exercise our tenant-only break right, or prior to the end of the lease term in
cases where we do not have a tenant-only break right, we may be obligated to continue to pay rent
and incur operating losses at the relevant site, which could adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations. For example, although we closed our Kembrey club in 2016,
we are contractually obliged to continue making rental payments in respect of this location until
the expiry of the lease agreement related thereto, in 2032.

**_We cannot assure you that the locations of our clubs will continue to be economically viable._**

The location of our clubs has significant influence on their results of operations. We cannot

assure you that current locations will continue to be economically viable. As demographic and
economic patterns change, current locations may not continue to be attractive and profitable.
Decrease in the population of neighborhoods where our clubs are located or adverse economic
conditions in these areas and those surrounding those neighborhoods could result in reduced
revenue at the relevant clubs and our ability to terminate the leases on our existing clubs is limited
by our lease arrangements. Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to demographic shifts
that will detrimentally impact some of our existing clubs.

Businesses in the U.K. are required to pay “business rates” for occupying a commercial

property. The U.K. government adjusts the value of business rates to reflect changes in the property
market approximately every five years. As a result of the adverse economic effects caused by the
COVID-19 pandemic, the scheduled April 1, 2021 revaluation of business rates was postponed
until 2023. However, the eventual adjustments of the business rates could result in increased estate
costs and, consequently, could have an adverse effect on the economic viability of certain clubs.
A decline in the economic viability of our clubs could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Increases in rising operating costs due to inflation and other factors may not be directly offset_**
**_by increased revenue._**

As operating costs and expenses increase due to inflation or other factors, we generally

attempt to offset the adverse effects of any increased costs by increasing prices, in line with industry
standards. We are subject to the risk that our costs of operations will increase, and we will be unable
to offset those increases through increased prices without adversely affecting demand.

In addition to inflation, increases in cost of labor, goods, rent, utilities and taxes could cause

operating costs to rise and thereby reduce our operating margins and have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, labor costs may increase
due to increases in minimum pension contributions, changes in the legislative landscape, intensifying
competition for qualified personnel or personal trainers and increases in the U.K. “national living
wage” or similar laws in the other countries in which we operate. Many, and in some cases all, of
the factors affecting these costs are beyond our control. On the other hand, if our revenue declines,
we may not be able to reduce our fixed expenses (such as rent, property taxes, insurance and utilities)
by the same degree or at the same rate to preserve profitability, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


-----

**_Due to the capital-intensive nature of our business, we may incur additional indebtedness in the_**
**_medium term if our cash flow or current facilities cannot support our capital requirements and,_**
**_if we are not able to access additional financing or capital as and if necessary, our ability to_**
**_operate successfully or expand our business may be impaired and our results of operations could_**
**_be adversely affected._**

Opening new clubs and maintaining existing clubs is capital intensive, and we require

significant capital to finance such activities, as well as to fund ongoing investments in our business
and to meet our debt obligations. We are pursuing a robust rollout strategy founded upon identifying
viable sites with strong demographic catchment areas, thus there can be no assurance that we may
not need to incur additional indebtedness or substantially reduce our growth plans to meet our capital
requirements in the medium-term. Raising new debt securities could increase our finance costs or be
available only on terms that restrict our business.

Any inability or delay in raising additional capital when and if required may affect our

ability to execute on our growth strategy or cause us to lose future opportunities or hinder our
ability to respond to competitive pressures, all of which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may identify and pursue the acquisition of other health and fitness businesses or existing_**
**_clubs and may fail to successfully integrate such businesses or clubs, may assume liabilities that_**
**_we are not aware of, or such businesses or clubs may not be as profitable as we expected them_**
**_to be._**

As opportunities arise, we will continue to assess possible acquisitions of other health and

fitness operators, as well as select clubs from other health and fitness operators, to complement
our organic site rollout strategy. Our ability to make such acquisitions could be affected by a
number of factors, including legal and regulatory changes, competition regulations, general
macroeconomic, social and political conditions and available capital.

Even if we are successful in acquiring target businesses, we may experience difficulties in

integrating targets into our business, may incur higher than expected costs or fail to realize the
anticipated benefits. For example, we may not be able to realize the expected synergies and cost
savings from our recent acquisition of the Meridian Group. Acquiring new businesses can place
significant demands on management, employees, suppliers, systems and resources and can expose
us to new or unidentified liabilities. An acquired business also may not perform in line with our
expectations at the time of the acquisition. Furthermore, we may not achieve the desired level of
revenue or cost synergy benefits on integration of new businesses or clubs, and the cost of achieving
such benefits may be higher than anticipated. Failure to integrate acquisitions successfully or the
manifestation of unexpected liabilities or costs associated with such acquisitions could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Additionally, we may be exposed to unexpected costs or liabilities resulting from

acquisitions which may not be covered by contractual representations and indemnities. Although
we typically conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition, we can provide no
assurance that we will discover all deficiencies, facts or material liabilities of an acquired business
for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator, and actual developments may


-----

differ significantly from our expectations and assessments. Our acquisition strategy may also be
impeded by governmental or regulatory approvals required in order to purchase certain targets.

Any acquisition or other strategic transaction we may undertake in the future could result

in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, an increase in interest expenses and
amortization expenses related to goodwill or other intangible assets or in the use by us of available
cash on hand to finance any such acquisitions. All of the aforementioned risks apply in relation to
our recent acquisition of the Meridian Group in January 2020. Unanticipated events or liabilities
and failures to achieve our acquisition target performance goals could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our new business initiatives may not achieve expected results._**

Our growth strategy involves a number of new business initiatives which serve to diversify

our offering into new formats of club and new lines of business within the health and fitness
market. This includes, among others, launching new products and services such as the rollout of
our Spa Retreats and Blaze studios as well as further expansion into international markets. We
cannot assure you that we will be able to implement these initiatives, nor can we assure you that
they will be successful. For example, we cannot guarantee that our Fit For Growth Program, which
is expected to yield approximately £10 million of annual cost savings from 2021 onwards
compared to our labor costs for the year ended December 31, 2019, will be successful or yield the
cost savings that we anticipate.

In determining our business strategies, we have made certain assumptions about the future

economic performance of the countries in which we currently operate. In addition, our business
strategies are premised upon certain assumptions regarding our financial performance and
expected returns on our investments, which also influence decisions regarding our capital
expenditures. These assumptions may change as a result of business, financial, economic,
competitive or market conditions as well as the unpredictable development of the COVID-19
pandemic.

We may be unable to develop new business initiatives and they may not perform in line

with expectations. In addition, regardless of the revenue that we may derive from them, these
initiatives will require financial investments and will involve significant diversions of
management’s time and attention, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our advertising and marketing programs may generate insufficient customer awareness to_**
**_successfully execute our growth strategy or effectively manage our growth._**

Successful implementation of our growth strategy will require significant expenditures

before any substantial associated revenue is generated. In particular, we rely on advertising through
a range of consumer channels, including newspapers, magazines, radio, the internet and social
media, to increase consumer awareness of our clubs and the services we offer. Our future growth
and profitability will depend, in large part, upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our advertising
and marketing programs in attracting new members. In order for our advertising and marketing
programs to be successful, we must manage advertising and marketing costs effectively to


-----

maintain acceptable operating margins and return on our marketing investment and convert
customer awareness into actual club memberships.

Our planned advertising and marketing expenditures may not result in increased total or

comparable sales or generate sufficient levels of customer awareness. As a result, we cannot assure
you that our recently opened or future clubs will generate revenue and cash flow comparable with
those generated by our mature clubs. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that our new clubs, on
average, will continue to mature at the same rate as our existing clubs, especially if economic
conditions deteriorate. We may not be able to manage our advertising and marketing expenditures
on a cost-effective basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Our growth could place strains on our management, employees, information systems and_**
**_internal controls, which may adversely impact our business._**

The growth of our business activities and operations places significant demands on our

management resources. We are constantly required to identify attractive club locations, negotiate
rental terms and open new clubs on a timely and cost-effective basis while maintaining the highest
level of quality, efficiency and performance at both mature and newly opened clubs. As a result,
we also need to recruit and retain new employees and maintain close coordination among our
executive, accounting, finance, marketing, sales and operations functions. These processes are
time-consuming and expensive and may divert management’s time and attention. We may not be
able to effectively manage our growing number of clubs and strategic initiatives, and any failure
to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_Our success is dependent on our brand and reputation._**

Our brand is an important asset of our business. Maintaining the reputation of, and value

associated with, our brand and our products and services is central to the success of our business,
including protecting any related copyrights and intellectual property associated with our brand. As
such, our ability to maintain the reputation of our brand with respect to the quality of our products
and services and high levels of customer service are important factors in earning and maintaining
customer goodwill.

We may also be the subject of complaints and litigation from our customers, employees or

other third parties, alleging health, safety or operational concerns, data security breaches, nuisance,
negligence or failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations (including in relation to the
COVID-19 pandemic). These claims, even if successfully disposed of without direct adverse
financial effect, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and divert our financial and
management resources from more beneficial uses. If we were to be found liable under any such
claims, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely
affected.

Failure to address, or appearing to fail to address, these and other issues could erode

consumer confidence in our clubs or our brand and may significantly reduce consumer demand for
our clubs, which may result in fewer memberships sold or renewed and diminish our ability to


-----

attract and retain quality staff. Furthermore, there has been a substantial increase in the use of
social media which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested
persons. Negative commentary about us may be posted on social media platforms or similar
devices at any time and may harm our reputation. Consumers value readily available information
about fitness and health clubs and often act on such information without further investigation and
without regard to its accuracy. The harm may be immediate, without affording us an opportunity
for redress or correction. Additionally, social media platforms provide users with access to such a
broad audience that collective action against our clubs, such as boycotts, can be more easily
organized.

If our efforts to maintain our brand and reputation are unsuccessful, or if our brand or

reputation are harmed due to the above factors or otherwise, our business, results of operations,
financial condition and prospects could be materially adversely affected.

**_Our intellectual property rights, including trademarks and trade names, may be infringed,_**
**_misappropriated or challenged by others._**

Intellectual property related to our brand is paramount to our continued success. We seek

to protect our trademarks, trade names, copyrights and other intellectual property by exercising
our rights under applicable laws. We may also from time to time be required to initiate litigation
or other enforcement action to enforce our trademarks, trade names and other intellectual property.
Third parties may also assert that we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated their
intellectual property rights, which could lead to litigation or other enforcement action against us.
Litigation, whether pending, threatened or actual, is inherently uncertain and could divert the
attention of management, result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, and could
negatively affect our membership sales and profitability regardless of whether we are able to
enforce or defend our rights successfully. If we fail to successfully protect our intellectual property
rights for any reason, or if any third party misappropriates, dilutes or infringes our intellectual
property, the value of our brand and our reputation may be harmed, which could have an adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Disruptions and failures involving our information technology systems could adversely affect_**
**_member enrolment, member services and financial and administrative functions._**

The timely development, implementation, and continuous and uninterrupted performance

of our business intelligence tools, hardware, network, applications, website and other systems,
including those which may be provided by third parties, are important factors in our delivery of
products and services to our customers. Our ability to protect these processes and systems against
unexpected adverse events is a key factor in continuing to offer consumers our full complement of
services on time in an uninterrupted manner. As a result, any disruption or failure involving our
information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Any issues, viruses, data inconsistencies, outages, interruptions or security breaches in

connection with our information technology systems could cause significant disruption to us, and
our members may become dissatisfied if such disruption or failure interrupts our ability to provide
our members with access to our clubs. Member dissatisfaction may cause members to stop using


-----

our services, cancel their membership or otherwise generate negative publicity, which could result
in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Moreover, a failure that causes our website to become unavailable could materially adversely
affect attendance at our clubs, online club viewing opportunities and online booking, any of which
could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Given that we are a technologically enabled company and hold a large amount of sensitive

and potentially valuable member information, we may also be subject to cyberattacks. Successful
penetration of our defenses against cyberattack could lead to the loss of member data and the direct
costs associated with this as well as broader reputational damage. While we believe that the actions
being taken have and will continue to reduce our cybersecurity risk, there can be no assurance that
our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects will not be adversely
impacted by disruptions and failures involving our information technology systems.

**_Our entry into new markets exposes us to additional risks and challenges associated with_**
**_operating internationally._**

Our international operations expose us to additional operational and market risk associated

with operating internationally and may require significant management attention and financial
resources. Our international operations also expose us to additional regulatory oversight by the
respective local authorities, as well as risks generally associated with international business
operations, including governmental regulations applicable to the health industry and changes in
such regulations, changes in social, political and economic conditions (including in connection
with the COVID-19 pandemic), limitations on foreign investments, restrictions on currency
convertibility and volatility of foreign exchange markets, inflation and government measures to
curb inflation and changes in domestic laws. Exposure to each of these risks or other risks
associated with operating internationally could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may expand into new international markets, which may have different market conditions_**
**_and consumer preferences than the U.K. and European markets in which we currently operate,_**
**_and expose us to other potential risks._**

We may consider potential expansion into new international markets either through the

acquisition of existing club portfolios or through organic rollout. Such international markets may
have different market conditions, club penetration rates, consumer culture and preferences and
discretionary consumer spending habits than the U.K. and the European countries in which we
currently operate, which may cause clubs in these new markets to perform differently than our
existing clubs and thus fail to deliver the expected financial performance and return on capital
employed. In addition, any such international expansion would result in our operations being
subject to new laws and regulations and could increase costs associated with complying with
existing laws, regulations or licensing and authorization regimes. Expansion into new international
markets could also subject us to risks related to adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.


-----

**_If we cannot retain senior management, and retain and attract other key managers, we may not_**
**_be able to manage our operations successfully and pursue our strategic objectives._**

The successful implementation of our strategy is dependent on our ability to recruit, retain

and motivate high-quality senior management and other personnel with extensive experience and
knowledge of the fitness industry, including club managers and regional managers who play an
important role in the operation of our clubs. Availability of such personnel is limited and
competition for such personnel is fierce. If we are unable to effectively recruit such employees and
manage our employee turnover rate, there could be a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to meet our labor needs is subject to many
external factors, including competition for and availability of qualified personnel in a given market,
unemployment levels within such market, wage rates, health and other insurance costs, pension
costs and changes in employment, labor or other workplace regulations, all of which are largely out
of our control. Increased competition for qualified employees could lead to salary cost inflation.

Notwithstanding our continued investment in our employees and our efforts to increase staff

retention, we have a high staff turnover rate and as a result may be unable to find sufficient trained
staff when needed. Lastly, our ability to recruit and retain personnel may also be affected by labor
activism and unrest in the U.K. or the European countries in which we operate. The departure of
senior management personnel or a failure to attract and retain other managers or qualified
employees while simultaneously controlling labor costs could delay or prevent the achievement of
our strategic objectives and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

**_Our clubs may be adversely affected by a change in the historical employment status of personal_**
**_trainers and coaches operating at those clubs._**

While our clubs employ the vast majority of the personal trainers and coaches working at

those clubs, a considerable number of personal trainers, tennis coaches and other fitness instructors
are self-employed independent contractors who use our premises to train their clients. Although
we believe that these personal training arrangements are in accordance with the applicable laws
and industry practice, there is a risk that personal trainers, tennis coaches or other fitness instructors
could be reclassified either due to a change in law or by the tax or other relevant authorities in the
respective countries in which we are active as either “employees” or “workers” (a quasiemployment status), rather than individuals in business on their own account.

If a personal trainer, tennis coach or other fitness instructor was reclassified by a tax or other

relevant authority as an employee or a worker, we could be subject to back-payment of taxes and
national insurance, social security and similar contributions, as well as claims regarding backpayment of minimum wage, holiday pay, and potentially pensions auto-enrolment in connection with
such reclassification. Aside from the monetary expense associated to legal or regulatory proceedings
on this issue and any damages, penalties or settlements resulting therefrom, however significant,
involvement with such proceedings could negatively affect our brand and require management
attention. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.


-----

**_We may not be able to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified coaches and_**
**_personal trainers._**

We engage approximately eight to ten coaches and personal trainers per club site. Personal

trainers interact with members within the clubs, drive increased member engagement and form a
core part of our value proposition to members. Availability of suitable personal trainers is limited
and competition for them is fierce. If we are unable to attract, retain or return to pre-COVID-19
levels of qualified and suitable personal trainers at our clubs, the customer proposition could be
diluted and staff costs could increase, as we would be required to hire additional staff. If we fail to
attract, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified and suitable personal trainers, there could
be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See “—
_Our clubs may be adversely affected by a change in the historical employment status of personal_
_trainers and coaches operating at those clubs.”_

**_Our unique “clubs with clubs” culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain_**
**_this culture as we grow, we could lose our competitive edge._**

We believe that a critical contributor to our success has been our “clubs with clubs” culture.

We pride ourselves upon our local and often member self-started societies among our clubs, which
build loyal communities centered around common interests and are backed by the full support of
our staff and facilities. The social scene is also at the core of our offering, as members value our
clubs as a place to socialize in a family-friendly setting. As we grow, members, employees and
independent contractors will become more dispersed and we may find it increasingly difficult to
maintain the beneficial aspects of our club culture, especially if we open new clubs outside of the
U.K. If we are unable to maintain our club culture, we may find it difficult to attract and retain
members and motivated employees, continue to perform at current levels or execute on our
business strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

**_Our dependence on third-party contractors and suppliers for site fit out, equipment provision,_**
**_equipment maintenance and certain other products and services could result in disruptions to_**
**_our business._**

We rely on third-party contractors and suppliers for various services and products, such as

site fit out, club equipment supply, club equipment maintenance services, food and beverage
supplies, cleaning services, certain marketing functions and certain security and first-aid monitoring
and response services, among others. Although we believe that adequate substitutes are currently
available, we depend on these third-party contractors and suppliers to consistently and efficiently
operate their day-to-day business. The ability of these third-party contractors and suppliers to
successfully provide reliable and high-quality services is subject to technical and operational risks
that are largely beyond our control. Any disruption to the operations of our contractors and suppliers
could impact our ability to service our existing clubs, maintain the quality of our product offering
and open new clubs on time or at all.

If we lose such contractors and suppliers, or are unable to renew supply contracts with our

major suppliers upon their expiry, or if such contractors and suppliers encounter financial hardships
unrelated to demand from us, we may not be able to identify or enter into agreements with


-----

alternative contractors and suppliers on a timely basis and on acceptable terms, if at all. Transitioning
to new contractors and suppliers may be time consuming and expensive and may result in
interruptions to our operations. Any significant increase in the price of club equipment or difficulties
in securing the quantity of equipment we require to open new and maintain or upgrade existing clubs
could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operation.

If we encounter delays or difficulties in securing the products or services provided by our

third-party contractors and suppliers or there is a deficiency, lack of or poor quality of such
products or services provided, our ability to serve our members and grow our brand and club
footprint would be interrupted. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operation.

**_We could be subject to litigation, including claims related to health or safety risks, at our clubs_**
**_and our business may be adversely affected by adverse publicity or negative public perception_**
**_regarding our services or our industry._**

The use of our clubs poses some potential health or safety risks to members or guests

through exertion and use of our equipment, swimming pools, racquet sports facilities, sunbeds and
other facilities and services. Our business requires some of our employees to work with chemicals,
equipment and other materials that have the potential to cause harm and injury when used without
due care. An accident or injury that occurs at any of our premises, whether to an employee, a
member of our club or a guest, could result in disruption to our business, have legal and regulatory
and/or reputational consequences and we may be required to compensate such individuals or incur
other costs and liabilities, any and all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

From time to time, we may be subject to litigation incidental to the normal course of our

business, including claims related to health and safety and employment-related claims. Although
we maintain third-party liability insurance in respect of such claims, we could suffer losses from
a liability judgment against us which may not be covered in whole or in part by our liability
insurance. We cannot assure you that claims will not be asserted against us for injury, illness or
death suffered by someone using our facilities or services or at our premises and we cannot
guarantee that we would be able to defend any such claims successfully. In addition, the child club
services we offer at our clubs expose us to claims related to child care, and our food and beverage
services expose us to risks such as food contamination and allergic reactions by customers. We
also face liability in connection with the construction or refurbishment of our clubs.

We might not be able to maintain our general liability insurance on acceptable terms in the

future or maintain a level of insurance that would provide adequate coverage against potential
claims. If we are unsuccessful in defending any of these litigation matters, they could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

A significant liability judgment, involving us or our competitors, could also result in a loss

of consumer confidence in our products and services and an actual or perceived loss of value of
our brand and may have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. Public perception of our brand may be affected adversely if we fail to meet the
standards which our members expect and any adverse publicity or negative public perception


-----

regarding our clubs and the products or services that we provide, the safety or quality of our
equipment, or our services could result in a substantial drop in demand for our products and
services. We may also be adversely affected by concerns which are not specific to our business,
but which affect our industry in general. Negative public perception may also arise from regulatory
investigations or claims brought by members or third parties, particularly in relation to the COVID19 pandemic, regardless of whether those investigations involve us or whether any claim is
successful against us.

**_We may be unable to maintain the required level of insurance cover on acceptable terms or at_**
**_an acceptable cost._**

Our operations are subject to inherent hazards and risks such as fires, injury to our

members, employees or guests, failure of equipment at our clubs, child care incidents, food
contamination and natural disasters. Many of these operating and other risks may cause a
disruption to or cessation of our operations, personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or
destruction of our properties or environmental pollution and could result in the imposition of
penalties and liability. Members or guests could also assert claims of personal injury in connection
with their use of our services and facilities.

While we maintain insurance of the type and in amounts that we believe is commercially

reasonable and that is available to businesses in our industry and believe that the policy
specifications and insured limits are adequate for foreseeable losses with terms and conditions that
are reasonable and customary for similar properties, we cannot be certain that our liability
insurance will be adequate or available at all times and in all circumstances to cover any liability
for costs related to personal injury, health or safety claims. If the insurance that we carry does not
sufficiently cover damages or other losses, our business, financial condition and results of
operations could be materially adversely affected.

An increase in the number of claims against health and fitness club operators generally

may result in the cost of insurance for the industry as a whole to rise and comprehensive insurance
coverage may become more difficult to attain. Any increase in the cost of insurance in the market
is also likely to impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We may be forced to close clubs temporarily or other adverse consequences could result due to_**
**_unforeseen circumstances._**

We may be forced to temporarily close clubs in the future as a result of adverse

consequences, such as property damage or personal injury due to any number of unforeseen
circumstances, including as a result of fire, flood, technical difficulties, loss of power, health and
safety incident, terrorist incident, natural disaster or unpredictable developments of the COVID19 pandemic. Political crises, such as riots, terrorist attacks, war and other political instability
could also disrupt our operations. In the past, we have had to close a small number of clubs
temporarily, primarily due to technical hazards such as flooding. More recently, a substantial
portion of our club estate was closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic (See “—The COVID-19
_pandemic has adversely impacted, and will continue to adversely impact, our business, financial_
_position and results of operations”). Although we continue to monitor developments and consider_
contingency plans as appropriate, any prolonged closures due to factors outside of our control may


-----

adversely affect our results of operations and may also result in longer term reductions in revenue
and profitability, for instance because of termination of memberships by members of the affected
clubs. Any losses may be in excess of, or outside the scope of, our insurance. Failure to properly
manage any temporary closures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Changes in foreign exchange risk may affect our results of operations and financial position._**

Our financial statements are presented in pound sterling and can be affected by foreign

exchange fluctuations through both translation risk (which is the risk that our financial statements
for a particular period or as of a certain date may be adversely affected by the prevailing exchange
rates of various currencies against the pound sterling) and transaction risk (which is the risk that
the currency of costs and liabilities fluctuates in relation to the currency of revenue and assets),
which may in each case adversely affect our results of operations.

Our functional and reporting currency is the pound sterling. Our revenue and costs are

generally matched in each subsidiary and are denominated in pound sterling or in euro. The
accounts of our subsidiaries are translated into our reporting currency, the pound sterling, for
consolidation purposes and therefore our financial results will be influenced by fluctuations in the
pound sterling to euro exchange rate. Any changes in foreign exchange risk could therefore have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**Risks relating to the regulatory environment**

**_We could be subject to material fines and claims related to health and safety risks at our clubs._**

Physical exercise and the use of our club services and facilities poses potential health and

safety risks, including serious injury or death, to members, employees and third-party contractors.
For example, water hygiene problems could develop in our changing facilities that may cause a
potential health risk to members and employees, an accident on the gym floor involving fitness
equipment could result in injury or death and we are also subject to the risk of drownings in our
swimming pools. We are also reliant on CCTV to ensure health and safety during unmanned hours
at our clubs and this technology may fail on occasion. We may be subject to material claims asserted
against us for any injury or death suffered by someone using our facilities or services. In addition,
our child club services expose us to claims related to child care and our food and beverage services
expose us to food contamination and allergic reactions by customers.

We might not be able to successfully defend such claims and we may be liable for fines,

damages and costs in excess of, or outside the scope of, our insurance coverage. Even with adequate
insurance coverage, such claims may cause significant damage to our reputation and may have a
material impact on our ability to attract or retain members.

The aforementioned risks are heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic and the

implementation of stringent hygiene protocols in our newly reopened clubs. We cannot be certain
that the measures we have been taking in connection therewith will be sufficient to mitigate the
risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we may be subject to potential litigation as a result of
members or our personnel who contract, or believe they have contracted, the virus at our clubs. We
may also be subject to potential litigation initiated by employees alleging that we have facilitated


-----

an unsafe working environment or have increased their exposure to the virus. We may also be at
risk of litigation following a possible outbreak at one of our clubs, which may cause us to incur
further significant costs and which may have a negative impact on our reputation. Any such fines
or claims may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Our operations and clubs are subject to various laws, regulations and planning and licensing

regimes, including in-person marketing, licensing, signage planning, advertising standards and
noise abatement requirements. Some environmental laws and regulations impose liability and
responsibility on present and former owners, operators or users, including tenants, of sites for the
clean-up of contamination at, or arising from, such sites, without regard to causation or knowledge
of contamination. Although we are not aware of any material actual or pending liabilities, claims
or actions relating to contamination of any of our current sites, future investigations may lead to
discoveries of contamination that we are required to remedy or damage that may subject us to claims
or regulatory proceedings. A breach of environmental regulations, standards relating to health and
safety or marketing and advertising or other applicable standards could potentially lead to the
mandatory closure of a club or multiple clubs for a period of time. We may also be subject to claims
by members and other visitors alleging exposure to potentially harmful substances that may be
present within our club sites. We may not be able to successfully defend against such claims or
regulatory proceedings or our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover the costs of such
claims. Any such actions may also lead to negative publicity for us and adversely affect our ability
to attract new and retain existing members, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

New laws, regulations and licensing regimes or changes in existing laws and regulations,

particularly those relating to environmental protection, health and safety, labor and employment,
tax, competition, consumer protection, marketing and advertising practices, privacy and
information security, the preparation and sale of food and the sale of alcoholic beverages as well
as ancillary health and fitness-related products and services, may require extensive system and/or
operating changes that may be difficult to implement and could increase our operating expenses
or subject us to additional costs, fines or other penalties. For example, a change in the VAT or
other applicable tax regimes, to our business may result in uncertainty, disruption to operations
and implementation costs, which we may not be able to pass on to our customers. Compliance
with, or any violation of, current and future laws, regulations or licensing regimes could require
material expenditures by us, expose us to government enforcement action and claims by members
or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Failure to comply with data protection legislation or a security breach or system failure in our_**
**_technical or information technology infrastructure could result in significant harm to us._**

In the ordinary course of business, we collect, transmit, store and otherwise process

member and employee data, including dates of birth, bank account details and sensitive personal
health data. We also maintain a large membership database made up of prospective, current and
former members. This data could be an attractive target for cyber-attack, including by organized
criminal groups, hackers, disgruntled current or former employees and others.


-----

Furthermore, our processing of personal data is subject to numerous laws, regulations and

standards related to the protection of personal data, including, among others, the EU-wide General
Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”). The GDPR, which came into force on May 25, 2018,
has increased our regulatory responsibilities when processing personal customer, employee and
other data in the conduct of our business and may lead to significant financial penalties if we
breach the requirements of the GDPR. In addition, Brexit and ongoing developments in the U.K.
have created uncertainty with regards to data protection regulation in the U.K. and could result in
the application of new data privacy and protection laws and standards to our operations in the U.K.
and our handling of personal data of users located in the U.K. The GDPR has been incorporated
into domestic law in the U.K., with amendments, as of the end of the Brexit transitional period
(the “UK GDPR”). The U.K. GDPR is supplemented and complemented by the Data Protection
Act 2018. This means that we are exposed to two parallel data protection regimes – the E.U. regime
and the U.K. regime – each of which potentially authorizes fines and other potentially divergent
enforcement actions for certain violations. Other countries have also passed or are considering
passing laws requiring local data residency and/or restricting the international transfer of data.
Moreover, it is still unclear what framework will apply and what legal mechanisms will be required
to transfer data from the European Economic Area to the U.K. under the GDPR. The relationship
between the U.K. and the EU in relation to transfers of personal data from the EU to the U.K. is
not fully settled by the Trade and Cooperation Agreement. Instead, the Trade and Cooperation
Agreement establishes a four- to six-month grace period during which transfers of personal data
from the EU to the U.K. can continue without additional safeguards, _provided that the U.K._
maintains its pre-Trade and Cooperation Agreement data protection laws. During this time, the
European Commission may adopt a U.K. adequacy decision which organizations can then rely on
for EU to U.K. personal data transfers but, if no U.K. adequacy decision is adopted, the U.K. will
be considered a third country at the end of the grace period and we will be required to implement
additional safeguards for personal data transfers – some of which are subject currently being
scrutinized or challenged – which could lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk
exposure. The European Commission has published a draft U.K. adequacy decision, but this has
yet to be considered and approved by a committee of the 27 Member Governments of the E.U.
Although we monitor the changes in law in this regard closely and make an effort to ensure
compliance, there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance at all times, and this could
lead to governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity,
which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.

We also use cookies and similar technologies for online behavioral advertising. In the U.K.

and the EU in general, informed consent is required for the placement of a cookie on a user’s
device (except for strictly necessary cookies). The EU-wide Privacy and Electronic
Communications Directive, as implemented into national legislation, which covers the use of
cookies and direct marketing, is currently under reform in the EU. Regulation of cookies and web
beacons may lead to even broader restrictions on our research activities, including efforts to
understand user internet usage and attract prospective users. Such regulations may increase the
costs for collecting or using online usage information, increase regulatory scrutiny and increase
the potential for civil liability under consumer protection laws. Similarly, changes to direct
marketing rules may also have a significant effect on how we market to prospective and current
members.


-----

If the measures put in place to protect against operational risks and risks in connection with

the security of personal data collected by us prove insufficient, our facilities and systems, and those
of our third-party providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of cyber terrorism or
sabotage, vandalism or theft, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, cyber fraud, programming
and human errors or other personal data breaches. A breach of data protection legislation involving
the unlawful processing, misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of personal data,
including the use of such information for direct marketing purposes, whether by us, one of our
sub-contractors or service providers or an unrelated party, could result in regulatory action,
compensation claims, fines of up to €20 million or 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of
the preceding financial year under the GDPR, whichever is higher, potential loss of business and
adverse publicity. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may be adversely affected by licensing regimes, tariffs or taxes._**

Any significant increase in the rates, taxes and other costs and tariffs levied by local

municipalities where our clubs are located or by the governments of the U.K. and the European
countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial
condition if we are unable to control costs in other areas. We have no control over the amounts levied
and could experience increases in the future. Compliance with and future changes to relevant
planning laws and building regulations, or the requirement to pay increased regulatory rates and
taxes, could restrict or delay our expansion plans or increase our costs. In addition, when
modernizing, refurbishing or expanding existing clubs or opening new clubs, we may require change
of use or planning consents from local authorities. Any inability or delays in receiving such consents
could delay or inhibit our refurbishment, extension or new club opening plans or increase costs
associated with these plans. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**Risks relating to our financial information**

**_The unaudited financial data and projections included herein need to be carefully considered_**
**_and incorporate forward-looking estimates that may differ from actual results._**

This Offering Memorandum incorporates data for the month of April 2021 that is derived

from preliminary results and estimates contained in our management accounts, which have not
been and will not be audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing
standards and are subject to change. The data for the month of April 2021 presented herein is not
intended to be a comprehensive statement of our financial or operational results for this period and
is based on a number of assumptions subject to inherent uncertainties and risks. In addition, we
present certain adjusted financial information in this Offering Memorandum which is designed to
present a view of certain select metrics after giving effect to the Transactions, has been derived as of
March 31, 2021 and for the year ended December 31, 2019 rather than as of and for the twelve
months ended March 31, 2021, which is the most recent twelve-month period. The year ended
December 31, 2019 was our last full trading period that was not impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic and, we believe, the financial information for the year ended December 31, 2019 more
accurately represents our operating and financial performance in a steady state of business than the
financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021. However, our results for the


-----

twelve months ended March 31, 2021 are significantly different than our results for the year ended
December 31, 2020. As such, you should not place reliance on them when making an investment
decision.

We have included data for the month of April 2021 in order to provide information about

our recent performance, but investors should understand that management accounts are not subject
to the same level of review and scrutiny as interim or year-end financial information. Furthermore,
management accounts may not provide for closing procedures that are as detailed as those
conducted at period or year-end, including the preparation of accruals, statutory adjustments, trueups and other closing procedures. Additionally, management accounts may be subject to cut-off
errors and misallocation of items between months.

The likelihood that the management accounts for the month of April 2021 may not be in

line with the financial data we report in our interim financial information or at year-end has been
increased by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, our revenue recognition has
been impacted by membership freezes, deferment and forbearance of rent payments, receipt of
government aid and mitigation moneys and unusually high volumes of gift cards and other offers
made to members. We have also recorded significant fluctuations in our cost-base, and
management has been required to make judgement calls in relation to non-cash rent adjustments
and categorization of exceptional costs. We cannot predict to what extent these atypical, nonroutine transactions and activities will impact our business going forward, and such uncertainty is
bolstered by the threat of new COVID-19 variants. Furthermore, we have recorded unusually high
levels of net member loss following the First Lockdown and the Second Lockdown as a result of
the COVID-19 pandemic. See “—The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and will
_continue to adversely impact, our business, financial position and results of operations.”_

This Offering Memorandum also incorporates data that is derived from our management

projections. These projections are based on our current estimates, and they involve risks,
uncertainties, assumptions (including in relation to our clubs remaining open for the remainder of
2021) and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially
different from any anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied
by such management projections.

While we believe that the methodology used to calculate our internal projections is

reasonable, investors should be aware that there are certain limitations inherent in our ability to
accurately predict financial performance, and that calculating the metrics presented herein requires
significant critical judgment. Management projections are “forward-looking” statements that
involve various risks and uncertainties. Please see “Forward-looking statements.” Any of these
management projections are subject to change and, in particular, we may determine that it is
appropriate to adapt our strategy and business plan in the future. These “forward-looking”
statements are not intended to be a forecast of our future business performance and are not
guarantees of future financial results, and our actual results could differ significantly from those
expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including but
not limited to the risks described in this “Risk factors” section. Specifically, we warn you that the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our cash outlays may also materially limit the accuracy and
the usefulness of these projections.

**_This Offering Memorandum includes certain non-IFRS financial measures calculated using_**
**_management estimates or projections and they should not be relied upon in isolation when_**
**_making an investment decision._**

We present in this Offering Memorandum Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA, which

takes into account, among other things, our estimate of the full period impact of costs savings
resulting from our Fit For Growth Program implemented in December 2020, our estimate of the
expected increase in EBITDA following our extensive refurbishment works and improvements of
the Meridian clubs and our estimate of the full period impact of expected head office cost savings
as a result of synergies between the Group and the Meridian Group and management initiatives,
because our management believes such adjustments are useful to describe the Adjusted EBITDA
our business may generate as it matures. However, we may not be able to realize the expected cost
savings of our Fit For Growth Program, to increase our EBITDA following our extensive
refurbishment works and improvements of the Meridian clubs and to realize the expected cost
savings as a result of synergies our acquisition of the Meridian Group and management initiatives.

This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate

or complete picture of our results of operations for the periods presented and may not be
comparable with our consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included
in this Offering Memorandum. Such risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors may cause
actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any anticipated future
results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by _Pro Forma_ Run Rate Adjusted
EBITDA.

**Risks related to our financial profile, the Notes and the Guarantees**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and_**
**_prevent us from fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes and the Guarantees._**

We are, and following the issuance of the Notes, will continue to be, highly leveraged. As

of March 31, 2021, after giving effect to the Transactions and the use of proceeds therefrom, we
would have had total third-party debt of £903.0 million (euro equivalent), excluding £928.1 million
of lease liabilities. We would also have had £125.0 million available to draw under the New
Revolving Facilities Agreement. See “Capitalization.”

The degree to which we will remain leveraged following the Transactions could have

important consequences to holders of the Notes offered hereby, including, but not limited to:

- making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes;

- increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse
economic and industry conditions, including an economic downturn due to the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic;

- requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the
payment of interest on indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to


-----

fund the payment of principal of indebtedness, working capital, capital expenditures,
acquisitions, joint ventures or other general corporate purposes;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the
competitive environment and the industry in which we operate;

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that
they are not as highly leveraged; and

- limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our

ability to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes.

**_Despite our high level of indebtedness, we may be able to incur significant additional amounts_**
**_of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness._**

We may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including secured

indebtedness and structurally senior indebtedness. Although the Indenture and the New Revolving
Facilities Agreement will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these
restrictions will be subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under
certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with those
restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the Indenture and the New Revolving Facilities
Agreement will not prevent us from incurring obligations that would not constitute indebtedness
under those agreements.

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the existing or future liabilities of the Company’s_**
**_subsidiaries that are not, or do not become, Guarantors or to the liabilities of Guarantors to the_**
**_extent that such liabilities exceed the principal amount of Notes that can be guaranteed or_**
**_secured by such Guarantors._**

Generally, claims of creditors, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred

stockholders (if any) of non-guarantor subsidiaries of the Company are entitled to payments of
their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for
distribution to their respective parent entity or the creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors.
Accordingly, in the event that any non-guarantor subsidiary of the Company becomes insolvent,
is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent
transaction:

  - the creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including the holders of the Notes, will have
no right to proceed against the assets of such non-guarantor subsidiary; and

  - creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary, including depositors, trade creditors and
preferred stockholders (if any) will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or
other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before the Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct
or indirect shareholder (as applicable), will be entitled to receive any distributions from
such subsidiary. As such, the Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to


-----

the creditors, including depositors, trade creditors and any preferred stockholders (if any)
of the non-guarantor subsidiaries of the Company. As of March 31, 2021, our subsidiaries
(including Meridian Spa & Fitness Deutschland GmbH) that will not guarantee the Notes
had £11.6 million of third-party borrowings, £8.6 million will be repaid as part of the
Transaction.

In addition, the Indenture will, subject to certain limitations, permit the Guarantors and

non-guarantor subsidiaries to incur substantial additional indebtedness without such incurrence
constituting a default under the Indenture, and such indebtedness may also be secured. The
Indenture will not contain any limitation on the amount of other liabilities, such as deposits and
trade payables in the ordinary course of business, that may be incurred by non-guarantor
subsidiaries.

**_The debt under our Euro Notes and New Revolving Facilities Agreement will bear interest at a_**
**_floating rate that could rise significantly, increasing our interest cost and debt and reducing our_**
**_cash flow._**

The debt under our Euro Notes will bear interest at floating rates of interest per annum

equal to EURIBOR, adjusted quarterly, plus an applicable margin. The debt under our Revolving
Facilities Agreement will bear interest at floating rates of interest per annum equal to compounding
overnight the Sterling Overnight Index Average published by the Bank of England (“SONIA”) plus
a spread adjustment for loans denominated in Sterling, EURIBOR for loans denominated in euro
or the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for loans denominated in U.S. dollars, in each
case plus an applicable margin. These rates could rise significantly in the future. Although we may
enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there
can be no assurances that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms.
Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount
(including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise
significantly, our interest expense associated with the debt under our Euro Notes and Revolving
Facilities Agreement, to the extent not fixed by means of hedging arrangements, would
correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow.

As a consequence of regulatory reforms, the common maturities of U.S. dollar LIBOR will

cease to be published as panel bank rates after 30 June 2023 (and all other LIBOR settings for all
currencies will cease as panel bank rates after 31 December 2021). It is not known if or when
regulatory reform may, in the future, cause EURIBOR to cease or be replaced. The U.S. dollar
floating rate market is currently expected to transition to use, in place of U.S. dollar LIBOR, a
floating rate equal to compounding overnight SOFR (the Secured Overnight Financing Rate
published by the Federal Reserve in the US) plus a spread adjustment, by not later than the time
that the relevant U.S. dollar LIBOR setting is to cease as a panel bank rate, although other
alternative rates may also be used. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform
differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Any such
consequence could have a material adverse effect on any of our debt linked to such a benchmark.

Regulatory requirements under the EU Benchmark Regulation (particularly in relation to

EURIBOR) and under the UK Benchmark Regulation (particularly in relation to LIBOR) may: (i)
discourage market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to a regulated


-----

benchmark (such as EURIBOR or LIBOR); (ii) trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used
for the benchmark or (iii) lead to the disappearance of the benchmark. The scheduled cessation of
the LIBOR benchmark as a panel bank rate or any proposal to cease the determination or
publication of any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark,
or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in
which the relevant benchmark is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and
conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark. Any
of the above changes or any other consequential changes as a result of international, national or
other proposals for reform or other initiatives may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in any
affected benchmark, which could have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on any
floating rate debt linked to that benchmark and on our ability to service debt that bears interest at
floating rates of interest, reducing cash flows otherwise available for our operations, capital
expenditures, acquisitions and servicing our debt obligations, including the Notes.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event that EURIBOR is no longer being calculated

or administered or is otherwise no longer generally accepted in the euro zone for the purposes of
determining floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated securities, the alternative
basis for determining the rate of interest on the Euro Notes will be any successor rate generally
accepted in the euro zone for the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of
euro-denominated securities, as identified by the Issuer in good faith. However, in the event that
there is no generally accepted successor rate to EURIBOR in the good faith judgement of the
Issuer, the Issuer, in consultation with an independent financial advisor, shall determine a
reasonably appropriate alternative basis for determining the rate of interest (and any applicable
adjustment spread to reduce or eliminate, to the extent reasonably practicable in the circumstances,
any economic prejudice or benefit (as the case may be) to holders of the Euro Notes as a result of
the replacement of EURIBOR (and any such alternative basis adopted will in all cases never be
less than 0%). This means that interest on the Euro Notes would be determined by the Issuer on
the basis of a benchmark rate, together with adjustments, that was not contemplated at the time
you purchased the Euro Notes issued on the Issue Date. The Indenture may require the exercise of
discretion by the Issuer and the making of potentially subjective judgments (including as to the
occurrence or not of any events which may trigger amendments to the Indenture) without the
consent of the holders of the Notes. The interests of the Issuer in making such determinations or
amendments may be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes. See “Description of the
_Notes.”_

**_We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future_**
**_operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities._**

The Indenture and the New Revolving Facilities Agreement will restrict, among other

things, our ability to:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;

- pay dividends or make other distributions or purchase or redeem our stock;

- make investments or other restricted payments;


-----

- enter into agreements that restrict our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends;

- transfer or sell assets;

- engage in transactions with affiliates;

- create liens on assets to secure indebtedness;

- impair security interests; and

- merge or consolidate with or into another company.

The covenants to which we will be subject could limit our ability to finance our future

operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that
may be in our interest. All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and
qualifications.

For the restrictions that will be included in the Indenture, see “Description of the Notes—

_Certain covenants.” For the restrictions that will be included in the New Revolving Facilities_
Agreement, see “Description of other financial arrangements—New Revolving Facilities
_Agreement.” In addition, we will be subject to the affirmative covenants contained in the New_
Revolving Facilities Agreement. In particular, the New Revolving Facilities Agreement will
require us to comply with a financial covenant. See “Description of other financial
_arrangements—New Revolving Facilities Agreement—Financial covenant.” Our ability to meet_
this financial covenant can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you
that we will meet it. A breach of any of those covenants, ratios, tests or restrictions could result in
an event of default under the New Revolving Facilities Agreement. Upon the occurrence of any
event of default under the New Revolving Facilities Agreement, subject to applicable cure periods
and other limitations on acceleration or enforcement, the relevant creditors could cancel the
availability of the facilities and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the New Revolving
Facilities Agreement, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition,
any default under the New Revolving Facilities Agreement could lead to an event of default and
acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration
provisions, including the Indenture. If our creditors, including the creditors under the New
Revolving Facilities Agreement, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you
that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts,
to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make
payments to enable us to repay the Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay
those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure
repayment of those amounts.

**_We require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations. Our_**
**_ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our control._**

Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, and to fund working capital

and capital expenditures, will depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate
sufficient cash. This depends, to some extent, on the success of our business strategy and on


-----

general economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative, regulatory and other factors, as well
as the other factors discussed in these “Risk factors,” many of which are beyond our control. Our
ability to make payments on our debt also depends on our cash flow cycle. If our interest payment
dates coincide with periods of significant cash outflow, we may have insufficient cash to pay our
obligations as they come due.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations,

that revenue growth, currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be
realized or that future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to
enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. In
particular, the continuing economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the
resulting restrictions and preventive measures, have adversely affected our ability to generate
sufficient cash flows from operations. Our cash flow forecasts are subject to assumptions that all
U.K. clubs re-open (and remain open) in May 2021 with 50% of European clubs re-opening in
June (and the remainder opening in July) and that our New Revolving Credit Facility up to an
amount of £125 million is available. We also assume recovery of member count to 668,000 by
September 2021 and repayment of deferred liabilities to landlords, suppliers and other creditors
that were accumulated during the closure period. These assumptions are subject to numerous
factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to be materially
different from those projected. See “—Risks related to our business—The COVID-19 pandemic
_has adversely impacted, and will continue to adversely impact, our business, financial position_
_and results of operations,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and_
_Results of Operations—Key factors affecting our results of operations—Impact of the COVID-19_
_pandemic” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of_
_Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”_

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings

under the New Revolving Facilities Agreement) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they
mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

- reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;

- sell assets;

- obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a

timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. Any failure to make payments on the Notes on a
timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our
ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Notes and
the New Revolving Facilities Agreement, will limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to
pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and
could require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business,
financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that any assets which we


-----

could be required to dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount
of proceeds realized from such sale would be acceptable.

**_Creditors under the New Revolving Facilities Agreement and any Hedging Agreements (as_**
**_defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) will be entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the_**
**_Collateral sold in any enforcement sale in priority to the Notes._**

The obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees will be secured on a first-ranking basis

with security interests over Collateral which will also secure our obligations under the New
Revolving Facilities Agreement. The Indenture will also permit the Collateral to be pledged to
secure additional indebtedness in accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor
Agreement.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the liabilities under the New Revolving Facilities

Agreement and any Hedging Agreement (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) that are
secured by assets that also secure obligation under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, will receive
priority with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any such assets.
See “Description of other financial arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

As a result, in the event of any realization or enforcement of the Collateral, you may not

be able to recover on the Collateral if the then-outstanding claims under the New Revolving
Facilities Agreement and any Hedging Agreements are greater than the proceeds realized.

**_The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that will have been_**
**_granted as security for the Notes and the Guarantees, and such security may not be sufficient_**
**_to satisfy the obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees._**

If there is an event of default on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be secured only

by the Collateral, which will include English law share charges over all the shares in the Company,
English law security assignment over any structural intercompany loans from Deuce ParentCo
Limited to the Company and an English law debenture over certain material assets of the Issuer
and the Guarantors (including the Company) that are incorporated in England, including first fixed
equitable security over any leasehold interests other than any leasehold interest that has 35 years
or less to run, subject to receipt of landlord consent (if required) and if landlord consent is not
received within 90 days of request there shall be no requirement to grant security over such
leasehold interests. See “Description of the Notes—Security—The Collateral.” There is no
guarantee that the value of the Collateral will be sufficient to enable the Issuer to satisfy its
obligations under the Notes. There is no requirement to register the security over the leasehold
interest and therefore, to the extent we grant security over these leases to other creditors in the
future and such creditors register their mortgages over the leases, the registered security interests
over such leases will have priority over the first fixed equitable security granted in favor of the
Notes. In addition, there is no requirement to provide funds to enhance the value of the Collateral
if it is insufficient. The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following an event of default with
respect to the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less than, amounts
due on the Notes.


-----

The amount of proceeds realized upon the enforcement of the security interests over the

Collateral or in the event of liquidation will depend upon many factors, including, among other
things, general market and economic conditions, the condition of the market for the Collateral, the
ability to sell Collateral in an orderly sale, the fair market value of the Collateral, the timing and
manner of the sale, whether or not our business is sold as a going concern, the jurisdiction in which
the enforcement action or sale is completed, the ability to readily liquidate the Collateral, the
availability of buyers and the condition of the Collateral and exchange rates. Further, there may
not be any buyer willing and able to purchase our business as a going concern, or willing to buy a
significant portion of our assets in the event of an enforcement action. The book value of the
Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. Portions of the
Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In addition, the
Collateral will not include all of our assets.

By its nature, some or all of the Collateral may not have a readily ascertainable market

value or may not be saleable or, if saleable, there may be substantial delays in its disposal. To the
extent that liens, security interests and other rights granted to other parties encumber assets owned
by the Issuer or the Guarantors, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect
to the property subject to their liens, security interests or other rights that could adversely affect
the value of that Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent, the Trustee or holders of the Notes
to realize or enforce that Collateral. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the
Collateral or the intercreditor arrangement governing our creditors’ rights could reduce the
proceeds realized upon enforcement of the Collateral. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are
not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes and the Guarantees, investors (to the extent
not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim
against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. In addition, there can be no assurance
that the Collateral could be sold in a timely manner, if at all. Proceeds from enforcement sales of
capital stock and assets that are part of the Collateral must first be applied in satisfaction of
obligations under the New Revolving Facilities Agreement and any Hedging Agreements (as
defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) and thereafter to repay on a pari passu basis the obligations
of the Issuer and the Guarantor under the Indenture, the Notes and any other indebtedness of the
Issuer and the Guarantors permitted to be incurred and secured by the Collateral pursuant to the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, the Indenture will allow incurrence of
certain additional permitted debt in the future that is secured by the Collateral on a priority or pari
_passu basis. The incurrence of any additional debt secured by the Collateral would reduce amounts_
available to you from the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral.

To the extent that other first priority security interests, pre-existing liens, liens permitted

under the New Revolving Facilities Agreement, the Indenture and other rights encumber the
Collateral securing the Notes, the parties may have or may exercise rights and remedies with
respect to the Collateral that could adversely affect the value of the Collateral and the ability of
the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on the Collateral.

**_The Issuer and the Guarantors have control over the Collateral securing the Notes, and the sale_**
**_of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents will allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in possession

of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from


-----

the Collateral securing the Notes. Subject to the Security Documents, so long as no default or event
of default under the Indenture or a continuing acceleration event under the New Revolving
Facilities Agreement would result therefrom, the Issuer and the Guarantors may, among other
things, without any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities
with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of
Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes._**

The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects,

encumbrances, liens and other imperfections permitted under the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement and accepted by other creditors that have the benefit of first priority security interests
in the Collateral securing the Notes from time to time, whether on or after the date the Notes are
first issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other
imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the
ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first
priority ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among
others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization
under the laws of certain jurisdictions. In addition, the laws, regulations or other governmental
measures introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may have the effect of imposing a
moratorium on or otherwise delaying or limiting the ability to enforce or pursue certain remedies
in respect of the Collateral.

The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally

associated with the realization of security interests over the Collateral. For example, the Security
Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. We cannot
assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure
you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on
such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those
assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly_**
**_to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral_**
**_may be restricted by local law._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under

the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantees will not be granted directly
to the holders of the Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Indenture
will provide (along with the Intercreditor Agreement) that only the Security Agent has the right to
enforce the Security Documents. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct
security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral
securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, who (subject to the provisions of the Indenture and
the Intercreditor Agreement) will provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the
Collateral.


-----

**_Security over certain Collateral will not be in place on the Issue Date or will not be perfected on_**
**_the Issue Date, and we will not be required to perfect security interests in some instances._**

Security over certain Collateral will not be in place on the Issue Date or will not be

perfected on the Issue Date. We have a period of two business days from the Issue Date in order
to provide security over certain Collateral and, in certain instances, an agreed longer period to take
certain perfection steps. If we or any Guarantor were to become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding
after the Issue Date, any such creation or perfection steps would face a greater risk of being
invalidated than if we had taken such steps at the Issue Date. If any such security interest is created
or perfected after the Issue Date, it will be treated under bankruptcy law as if it were delivered to
secure previously existing debt, which is materially more likely to be avoided as a preference by
the bankruptcy court than if the steps were taken at the time of the Issue Date. To the extent that
the grant or perfection of any such security interest is avoided as a preference, you would lose the
benefit of such security interest.

**_The Security Agent may not be able to appoint its choice of administrator in the event of_**
**_insolvency nor have the right to appoint an administrative receiver._**

There is a risk that the floating charges granted by the Issuer and the Guarantors would not

constitute qualifying floating charges (as defined in paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 of the UK
Insolvency Act 1986, as amended) and, as a result, it would be unlikely that the Security Agent
would be able to appoint its choice of administrator and the Security Agent would not have the
right to appoint an administrative receiver. For further details on appointment of administrators or
administrative receivers, see “Certain insolvency and local law limitations—England and Wales—
_Administration and floating charges.”_

**_The interests of holders of the Euro Notes and the Sterling Notes may be inconsistent and the_**
**_interests of the holders of the Notes and additional notes issued under the Indenture from time_**
**_to time may be inconsistent._**

The Euro Notes and the Sterling Notes will be issued pursuant to a single Indenture. Under

the Indenture, the Euro Notes can vote, and the Sterling Notes will be able to vote, as a single class
with respect to amendments, waivers or other modifications of the Indenture other than with
respect to amendments, waivers or other modifications that will only affect the relevant series of
Notes. The Euro Notes and the Sterling Notes will bear different fixed interest rates, have a
different call schedule and call protection and have other features that differ. As a result of these
differences, the interests of holders of the Euro Notes and the interests of holders of the Sterling
Notes could conflict. Subject to certain restrictions, further series of additional notes may be issued
under the Indenture which have different terms in respect of currency, interest rate and certain
other matters. Such additional notes will also generally vote as a single class with other series of
notes issued under the Indenture but may have interests that differ from the holders of other series
of notes issued under the Indenture, including the Notes.


-----

**_Additional Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S may not be fungible with existing Notes for U.S._**
**_federal income tax purposes._**

Additional Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S from time to time may be issued with the

same ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as the applicable
series of notes previously issued under the Indenture without being fungible with such series of
notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

If you are a U.S. holder (as defined in “Certain tax considerations—Certain United States

_federal income tax considerations”) considering the purchase of Notes sold pursuant to Regulation_
S as part of this offering of Notes or in the secondary market, you should consult your tax advisors
concerning the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership
and disposition of such Notes, including with respect to the potential issuance of additional Notes
that are not fungible with the applicable series of initial Notes issued under the Indenture for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, but which, nevertheless, are not capable of being separately
identified.

In the event Additional Notes are issued pursuant to Regulation S that bear the same ISIN,

Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as Notes belonging to the same
series previously issued, without being fungible with such series of initial Notes for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes that form part of that
series, including in respect of investors that hold Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global
Notes on or prior to the date of issuance of such Additional Notes, will not be eligible for transfer
to Book-Entry Interests in a Rule 144A Global Note (if any) representing Notes of that same series.
Such a restriction could adversely impact the liquidity of sales of Book-Entry Interests in the
Regulation S Global Notes. See “Book-Entry, delivery and form—Transfers” and “Description of
_the Notes—Additional Notes.”_

**_If certain changes to tax law were to occur, we would have the option to redeem the Notes._**

If certain changes in the law of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, as defined under

“Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts,” become effective that would impose withholding
taxes or other deductions on the payments on the Notes or the Guarantees, we may redeem the
Notes of any series in whole, but not in part, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date
of redemption. We are unable to determine whether any such changes to any tax laws will be
enacted, but if any such changes occur, the Notes will be redeemable at our option.

**_Upon an IPO Pushdown, certain material Collateral and Guarantees may be released, any_**
**_retaken Collateral may be subject to hardening periods, and U.S. holders may have U.S. federal_**
**_income tax consequences._**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake an IPO Pushdown (as defined in

“Description of the Notes”). See “Description of the Notes—IPO Pushdown.” The Indenture will
provide that upon consummation of an IPO Pushdown, among other things, references to the
Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) in the Indenture shall apply
only to the IPO Pushdown Entity (as defined in “Description of the Notes”) and its Restricted


-----

Subsidiaries (as defined in “Description of the Notes”) from time to time (which may not constitute
all or substantially all of the Company’s assets). Upon such substitution, each Holding Company
(as defined in “Description of the Notes”) of the IPO Pushdown Entity will be irrevocably and
unconditionally released from all obligations under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and
any security granted by any such Holding Company, and the Guarantees and any Collateral
provided by such entities will therefore be released, which could materially reduce the Collateral
securing the Notes and the Guarantees. Moreover, we may elect to, but are under no obligation to,
revoke or otherwise reverse an IPO Pushdown undertaken in contemplation of an IPO Event (as
defined in “Description of the Notes”), or to replace any Guarantees or Collateral released pursuant
thereto, in the event that such IPO Event is not consummated. To the extent that new security
documents in respect of any collateral to be retaken (including a pledge over the shares of the
Company) are entered into, such collateral may be subject to new hardening periods. In addition,
the IPO Pushdown may result in a deemed exchange of the Notes for U.S federal income tax
purposes, depending upon the specific circumstances of the IPO Pushdown, and may have tax
consequences for U.S. holders (as defined in “Certain tax considerations—Certain U.S. federal
_income tax considerations”), including recognition of gain or loss on such deemed exchange. See_
“Certain tax considerations—Certain United States federal income tax considerations.”

**_The incurrence of permitted debt in the future may create or restart hardening periods, i.e. the_**
**_periods of time following the granting of security interests during which such security interests_**
**_may be challenged in accordance with the laws applicable in England and Wales._**

The granting of shared security interests to secure future indebtedness permitted to be

secured by the Collateral may restart or reopen hardening periods, as the Indenture permits the
release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Notes in certain circumstances, including
in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness. The applicable hardening periods for
these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted
or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or perfected were to be enforced before
the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void
or ineffective and it may not be possible to enforce such security interest. The same rights also
apply in connection with the accession of subsidiaries as additional Guarantors of the Notes and
the granting of security interests over their respective assets and equity interests for the benefit of
holders of the Notes.

**Risks related to our structure**

**_The Issuer is a newly formed, wholly owned finance subsidiary that does not have any revenue_**
**_of its own and will depend on cash from operating companies to be able to make payments on_**
**_the Notes._**

The Issuer is a newly formed, wholly owned finance subsidiary of the Company with no

business operations or significant assets, other than the Notes and the Proceeds Loan made by the
Issuer to the Company. The Issuer will be dependent upon the cash flow from our operating
companies to meet its obligations under the Notes. We intend to provide funds to the Issuer in
order for the Issuer to meet its obligations under the Notes principally through payments under the
Proceeds Loan. We expect to provide funds to the Company to service the payments under the
Proceeds Loan principally through the provision of intercompany loans and dividends and other


-----

distributions. If the subsidiaries within the Group do not fulfill their obligations under any such
intercompany loans and do not otherwise distribute cash to the Company, and in turn to the Issuer,
in order for the Issuer to make scheduled payments on the Notes, the Issuer will not have any other
source of funds that would allow it to make payments to the holders of the Notes. The amount of
cash available to the Issuer will depend on the profitability and cash flows of the operating
companies in the Group and the ability of those companies to transfer funds under applicable law.
The operating companies in the Group, however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted
under applicable law to, make distributions or advance loans, directly or indirectly, to the Issuer
in order for the Issuer to make payments in respect of the Notes. Various agreements governing
the Group’s debt may restrict, and in some cases, may prevent the ability of the members of the
Group to transfer funds within the Group. In addition, the members of the Group that do not
guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make payments with respect to the Notes.

**_The interests of our controlling shareholder may differ from the interests of the holders of the_**
**_Notes._**

TDR Capital indirectly beneficially owns approximately 94.2% of the outstanding shares

of the Company. As a result, TDR Capital is able to control matters requiring shareholder approval,
including the election and removal of our directors, our corporate and management policies,
potential mergers or acquisitions, payment of dividends, asset sales and other significant corporate
transactions. The interests of TDR Capital may differ from yours in material respects. For example,
if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts as they mature, the interests of
TDR Capital, as ultimate majority shareholder, may be in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures,
financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investment,
even though such transactions might involve risks to you as a holder of Notes. TDR Capital has
no contractual obligations to fund our business and may not have sufficient liquidity to fund our
business, if we require additional funding. Additionally, the Indenture will permit us to pay
management fees, dividends or make other restricted payments under certain circumstances, and
TDR Capital may have an interest in us doing so. See “Certain relationships and related party
_transactions.”_

Furthermore, TDR Capital and their affiliates are in the business of making investments in

companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly
and indirectly with us, or with which we conduct business. TDR Capital and their affiliates may
also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result,
those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. You should consider that the interests
of TDR Capital and their affiliates may differ from yours in material respects. See “Principal
_shareholders” and “Certain relationships and related party transactions.”_

**_We may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a change of_**
**_control._**

The Indenture will contain provisions relating to certain events constituting a “change of

control” of the Company. Upon the occurrence of a change of control, we will be required to offer
to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. If a
change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds


-----

available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the
purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in our New Revolving Facilities
Agreement, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other then-existing contractual
obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in
an event of default under, or acceleration of, our New Revolving Credit Facility and other
indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under
such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive
cash from members of the Group to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes, following the
occurrence of a change of control, may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. In
addition, under the terms of the New Revolving Facilities Agreement, under certain circumstances,
we are required to repay an equal amount of debt and cancel the corresponding commitments under
our New Revolving Facilities Agreement if we repay all or a portion of the principal under the
Notes. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If
an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when the Group is prohibited from
providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent
of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance
the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not
obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we may
require third party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control.
We cannot assure you that the Group would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the
Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would,
in turn, constitute a default under the New Revolving Facilities Agreement. See “Description of
_the Notes—Change of Control.”_

The change of control provision to be contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford

you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization,
restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you,
because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or,
even if they do, may not constitute a “Change of Control” under the Indenture. Except as described
under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,” the Indenture will not contain provisions
that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a
reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction.

In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of

control will be deemed not to be a change of control if a defined consolidated leverage ratio does
not exceed a certain level in connection with such event. In the event the Company is sold to a new
investor, irrespective of whether such sale constitutes a change of control under the Indenture, no
assurance can be given that any such investor will continue to implement our current business and
financial strategy. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the
_Notes—Certain definitions—Specified Change of Control Event.”_

The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or

substantially all of the assets of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to
any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially
all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the Company’s and its restricted


-----

subsidiaries’ assets, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of
control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_English insolvency laws may provide you with less protection than U.S. bankruptcy law._**

The Issuer and other members of the Group, including the Guarantors, are incorporated

under the laws of England and Wales. Accordingly, insolvency proceedings with respect to any of
those entities would be likely to proceed under, and be governed by, English insolvency law.
English insolvency law is not identical to, and its insolvency outcomes may vary from, the laws
of the United States or other jurisdictions with which investors are familiar. In the event that any
one or more of the Issuer or Guarantors experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict
with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings or whether English insolvency
laws would be favorable to your interests.

In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the initial Guarantors, any future Guarantors,

if any, or any other of the Company’s subsidiaries were to experience financial difficulty, it is not
possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar
proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Future Guarantees and
Collateral to be provided by entities organized in jurisdictions not discussed in this Offering
Memorandum, will also be subject to material limitations pursuant to their terms, by statute or
otherwise. Any enforcement of such Guarantees or security after bankruptcy or an insolvency
event in such other jurisdictions will be subject to the insolvency laws of the relevant entity’s
jurisdiction of organization or other jurisdictions. The insolvency and other laws of each of these
jurisdictions may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other, including in the areas
of rights of secured and other creditors, the ability to void preferential transfer, priority of
governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the
proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question
whether any particular jurisdiction’s laws should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce
your rights under the Guarantees or the Collateral in these jurisdictions and limit any amounts that
you may receive. See “Certain insolvency and local law limitation.”

**_Each Guarantee will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by_**
**_applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability._**

Each Guarantee will provide the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the

relevant Guarantor. However, the Indenture will provide that each Guarantee will be limited to the
maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without rendering the relevant
Guarantee, as it relates to that Guarantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under
applicable law, and enforcement of each Guarantee would be subject to certain generally available
defenses. See “Certain insolvency and local law limitation.”

Enforcement of any of the Guarantees against any Guarantor will be subject to certain

defenses available to Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. Although laws differ among these
jurisdictions, these laws and defenses generally include those that relate to corporate purpose or
benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy
challenges, financial assistance, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. If


-----

one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor may have no liability or
decreased liability under its Guarantee depending on the amounts of its other obligations and
applicable law. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in
such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of any Guarantee against any Guarantor. In
addition, the laws, regulations or other governmental measures introduced in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic may have the effect of imposing a moratorium on or otherwise delaying or
limiting the ability to enforce or pursue certain remedies in respect of the Guarantees.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or

insolvency law and other laws, a court could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s
obligations under its Guarantee, (ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid
under a Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors
or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found that:

- the relevant Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over
another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or, in certain
jurisdictions, when the granting of the Guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a preference
or when the recipient was aware that the Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant
Guarantee;

- the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate
benefit for the relevant Guarantee and the Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent
because of the relevant Guarantee; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because
of the relevant Guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur,
indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity;

- the relevant Guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not to be
in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor; or

- the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee was in excess of the maximum
amount permitted under applicable law.

These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of our

subsidiaries pursuant to the Indenture.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a

Guarantor was “insolvent” at the relevant time or that, regardless of method of valuation, a court
would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or a that a court would not
determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was
issued, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or
conveyances on other grounds.

The liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to the amount that will

result in such Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper
corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what
standard a court will apply determining the maximum liability of each Guarantor. There is a


-----

possibility that the entire Guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be
extinguished.

If a court were to decide that a Guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or

conveyance and voided such Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may
cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the
Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor under the relevant Guarantee which has not been
declared void. In the event that any Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or
to the extent the agreed limitation of the Guarantee obligations apply, the Notes would be
effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, and if we cannot satisfy our
obligations under the Notes or any Guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or
conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any
amounts outstanding under the Notes.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the_**
**_Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees will be released automatically and under_**
**_which the Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the_**
**_Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees will be

released automatically, including:

- in connection with any sale or other disposition of the property or assets constituting Collateral,
if the sale or other disposition does not violate the “Limitation on sale of assets and Subsidiary
_stock” covenant or other provisions of the Indenture;_

- in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and share capital, of such Guarantor;

- if the Company designates any restricted subsidiary to be an unrestricted subsidiary in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and
assets, and share capital, of such subsidiary;

- in accordance with the “Amendments and waivers” provisions of the Indenture;

- upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations in respect of the Notes,
legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as
provided under the captions “Description of the Notes—Defeasance,” and “Description of the
_Notes—Satisfaction and discharge”; or_

- in connection with an enforcement sale pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement.

In addition, under various circumstances, the Guarantees will be released automatically, including:

- in connection with any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of a
Guarantor (including by way of merger or consolidation) or the share capital of that Guarantor
to a person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Company or


-----

a restricted subsidiary of the Company, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the
“Limitation on sale of assets and Subsidiary stock” covenant of the Indenture and the relevant
Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of the sale or other disposition;

- if the Company designates any restricted subsidiary that is a Guarantor to be an unrestricted
subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

- in accordance with the “Amendments and waivers” provisions of the Indenture;

- upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations in respect of the Notes,
legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as
provided under the captions “Description of the Notes—Defeasance,” and “Description of the
_Notes—Satisfaction and discharge”; or_

- in connection with an enforcement sale pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement.

In addition, the Guarantees will each be subject to release upon enforcement sale as contemplated
under the Intercreditor Agreement. Unless consented to, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide
that the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, shall not, in an enforcement scenario, exercise
its rights to release the relevant Guarantees or security interests in the Collateral unless the relevant
sale or disposal is made:

- for consideration all or substantially all of which is in the form of cash;

- to the extent there is a release of Guarantees or security granted for the benefit of the holders
of Notes, concurrently with the discharge or release of the indebtedness of the disposed entities
to certain other creditors, including the creditors under the New Revolving Facilities
Agreement and holders of the Notes; and

- pursuant to a public auction, or a fairness opinion has been obtained from an internationally
recognized investment bank or accounting firm selected by the Security Agent.

See “Description of other financial arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description
_of the Notes.”_

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the_**
**_procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through

Euroclear and Clearstream. Interests in the global Notes will trade in book-entry form only, and
Notes in definitive registered form, or definitive registered Notes, will be issued in exchange for
book-entry interests only in very limited circumstances. Owners of the book-entry interests will
not be considered owners or holders of Notes unless and until definitive notes are issued in
exchange for book-entry interests. Instead, the common depositary (or its nominee) for Euroclear
and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the Notes in global form.

Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Notes in

global form will be made to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to the common


-----

depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, such payments will be credited to Euroclear
and Clearstream participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the Notes in global form
and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary
for Euroclear and Clearstream, none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Paying Agent
or any other paying agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records
relating to or payments of interest, principal or other amounts to Euroclear and Clearstream, or to
owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest in the Notes, you
must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and, if you are not a participant in
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your
interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.

Owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations

for consents or requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes, including
enforcement of security for the Notes and the Guarantees. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest,
you will be reliant on the common depositary (as registered holder of the Notes) to act on your
instructions and will be permitted to act directly only to the extent you have received appropriate
proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. We cannot
assure you that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable
you to vote on any requested actions or to take any other action on a timely basis.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the_**
**_Notes may be limited._**

We cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any market in the Notes, your ability to sell

your Notes or the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other

things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities.
Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that
have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a
trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for
similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading
market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which the
Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any
such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our
prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an active
trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell
your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

Although an application will be made to the Exchange for the listing of and permission to

deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be
or remain listed. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the
permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange being granted, failure to be
approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an alternative admission to listing on
another stock exchange) of the Notes, as applicable, from the Official List of the Exchange may
have a material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes, as applicable, in the secondary
market.


-----

In addition, the Indenture will allow us to issue additional notes in the future, which could

adversely impact the liquidity of the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Additional Notes.”

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and_**
**_may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The

credit ratings address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit
risks in determining the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The
ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional
risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating
is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension
or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will
remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn
entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A
suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one
or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our
financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_The transferability of the Notes may be limited under applicable securities laws._**

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the

Securities Act or the securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered,
may not be offered or sold in the United States, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable
securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction. See “Notice to investors” and “Transfer
_restrictions.” It is the obligation of holders of the Notes to ensure that their offers and sales of the_
Notes within the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws.

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries are organized outside the

United States, and their business is conducted outside the United States. The directors and
executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. Although
the Issuer and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in
connection with any action under U.S. securities laws or under the Indenture, you may be unable
to effect service of process within the United States on the directors and executive officers of the
Issuer and the Guarantors. In addition, because the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and the
assets of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be
unable to enforce against them judgments obtained in the U.S. courts. Moreover, in light of recent
decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer and the Guarantors may not be subject
to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. See “Enforcement
_of civil liabilities.”_


-----

**_Investors in and purchasers of the Notes may have limited or no recourse against our_**
**_independent auditors._**

See “Independent auditors” for a description of the independent auditors’ reports,

including language limiting the independent auditors’ scope of responsibility in relation to their
audit work. Investors in and purchasers of the Notes may have limited or no recourse against the
independent auditors.

Investors in and purchasers of the Notes should understand that consistent with guidance

issued by ICAEW, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, the independent
auditors’ reports included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum each state that: the report has
been prepared for the named parties (the “Addressees”) solely in response to a request from the
Addressees for an opinion from independent auditors on the truth and fairness of the non-statutory
directors’ reports and financial statements; that the report was designed to meet the agreed
requirements of the Addressees determined by their needs at the time; that the report should not
therefore be regarded as suitable to be used or relied on by any party wishing to acquire rights
against the independent auditors other than the Addressees for any purpose or in any context; that
any party other than the Addresee(s) who obtains access to the report or a copy and chooses to rely
on the report (or any part of it) will do so at its own risk; and that to the fullest extent permitted by
law, the independent auditors will accept no responsibility or liability in respect of the report to
any other party. In the context of the Offering, the independent auditors have reconfirmed to us
that they do not intend their duty of care in respect of their audits to extend to any party, such as
investors in and purchasers of the Notes, other than the Addressees of their reports.

Without in any way, or on any basis, affecting, adding to or extending the independent

auditors’ duties and responsibilities to the Addressees or giving rise to any duty or responsibility
being accepted or assumed by or imposed on the independent auditors to any party except the
Addressees, the independent auditors have provided consent to the Company’s inclusion,
independently of the independent auditors, of the audit reports with the non-statutory historical
financial statements to which they relate in this Offering Memorandum for a proposed issuance of
Notes, thereby demonstrating that an audit of the non-statutory directors’ reports and financial
statements for each relevant period has been undertaken for the Addressees. The consent provided
by the independent auditors is different from a consent filed with the SEC under Section 7 of the
Securities Act, which is applicable only to transactions involving securities registered under the
Securities Act. As the Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, the
independent auditors have not filed a consent under Section 7 of the Securities Act. The
independent auditors’ reports on the historical financial statements as of and for the period from
January 4, 2018 to December 31, 2018 and as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and
2020, are included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration statement

or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered under the Securities
Act, or in a report filed under the Exchange Act. If a US court (or any other court) were to give
effect to the language set out above, the recourse that investors in and purchasers of the Notes may
have against the independent auditors based on their reports or the non-statutory directors’ report
and financial statements to which they relate could be limited. The extent to which independent
auditors may have responsibility or liability to third parties can be unclear under the laws of many


-----

jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom. The inclusion of the language referred to above,
however, may limit the ability of holders of the Notes to bring any action against the independent
auditors for damages arising out of an investment in or purchase of the Notes.

**Selected historical consolidated financial data**

**Basis of presentation**

**_Financial information of the Issuer and the Company_**

The Issuer is a newly formed entity incorporated on May 6, 2021 for purposes of facilitating

the Transactions and performing certain activities related thereto. The Issuer is a wholly owned
direct subsidiary of the Company. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer has no
revenue-generating activities of its own, and no business operations, material assets or liabilities
other than those acquired or incurred in connection with its incorporation and the Transactions. As
a result, no historical financial information of the Issuer is included below.

The Company was incorporated on May 18, 2018 as a holding company. The Company is

indirectly owned by Deuce Holdco Limited (“HoldCo”). As of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, the Company has no revenue-generating activities of its own, and no business
operations, material assets or liabilities other than (i) certain existing indebtedness which will be
repaid with the proceeds of the Transactions (see “Use of proceeds”) and (ii) a £2.0 million annual
monitoring fee payable to TDR Capital. As a result, no historical financial information of the
Company is included below.

**_Historical Financial Information of Holdco_**

The consolidated historical and other financial data presented below have been derived

from (i) the audited consolidated financial statements of HoldCo as of and for the period from
January 4, 2018 to December 31, 2018 and as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and
2020, including the accompanying notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with
IFRS and which have been audited by Deloitte LLP and (ii) the unaudited condensed consolidated
interim financial statements of HoldCo as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2021,
including accompanying notes thereto (with comparable financial information for the three months
ended March 31, 2020), which have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial
Reporting, in each case included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. References to the
“Group,” “us” or “our” in the context of historical financial information or other financial
information relate to HoldCo and its subsidiaries. The audit reports for the period from January 4,
2018 to December 31, 2018 and as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020,
included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, express an unqualified opinion for each of the
respective periods and the audit report in relation to the audited consolidated financial statements
for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 include a material uncertainty paragraph related
to going concern as set forth in Note 2 to such financial statements.

IFRS 16 (Leases) was published on January 13, 2016 by the International Accounting

Standard Board. It became effective on January 1, 2019 and applies to the first full financial year
commencing on or after that date. Our first full financial year following the effective date of IFRS
16 began on January 1, 2019, and we applied the modified retrospective approach of adopting the
new standard, which did not require a restatement of comparative results for the financial period
ended December 31, 2018. On adoption of IFRS 16, the Group recognized lease liabilities in
relation to leases which had previously been classified as “operating leases” under the principles


-----

of IAS 17. These liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments,
discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate as of January 1, 2019. The weighted
average lessee’s incremental borrowing rate applied to the lease liabilities on January 1, 2019 was
6.8%. For leases previously classified as “finance leases,” the carrying amount of the lease asset
and lease liability immediately before transition were recognized as the carrying amount of the
right-of-use asset and the lease liability at the date of initial application. For more information on
the adoption of IFRS 16 and the adjustments made in relation thereto, see “Management’s
_discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations—Factors affecting_
_comparability of our results of operations—Adoption of IFRS 16” and Note 33 to the HoldCo_
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, we identified that both deferred tax asset

balances and reserves had been understated by £21 million as of December 31, 2019. As a result,
we have restated the consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2019. As
mentioned above, the Group adopted IFRS 16 Leases retrospectively with the cumulative effect of
its application being recognized as of January 1, 2019, but did not restate comparatives for the
2018 reporting period, as permitted under the specific transition provisions in the standard. The
adjustments arising from the new leasing rules were therefore recognized in the opening balance
sheet on January 1, 2019. There were no errors related to the adoption of IFRS 16 itself. The error
was restricted to the deferred tax calculation. The misstatement of the deferred tax balances related
to the complexities of the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases retrospectively from January 1, 2019. There
is no impact on the consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the
effect on the consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2019 was to increase
the opening January 1, 2019 deferred tax assets by £21 million and to reduce accumulated losses
as of January 1, 2019 by £21 million.

Our consolidated financial statements include the results of operations and financial

position of HoldCo, which are not attributable to the Company or its subsidiaries. As a result, the
consolidated financial statements of HoldCo are not directly comparable to the historical financial
information of the Company and its subsidiaries, which is prepared in accordance with IFRS. The
main differences between the consolidated financial position and results of operations of HoldCo
and the Company (i) as of and for the period from January 4, 2018 to December 31, 2018, related
to interest income in relation to shareholder loans from HoldCo to its direct and indirect
shareholders and cash on balance sheet held under HoldCo’s name, which amounted to £2.3
million and £1.0 million, respectively, and a shareholder loan from HoldCo to the Company which
amounted to £5.9 million; (ii) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, related to the
balance of a shareholder loan from HoldCo to its shareholder and cash on balance sheet held under
HoldCo’s name, which amounted to £2.1 million and £1.5 million, respectively, and £0.2 million
additional finance cost incurred by the Company in relation to interest paid on a £5.3 million
shareholder loan from HoldCo to the Company; (iii) as of and for the year ended December 31,
2020, related to the balance of a shareholder loan from HoldCo to its shareholder and cash on
balance sheet held under HoldCo’s name, which amounted to £2.2 million and £1.4 million,
respectively, and £0.1 million additional finance cost incurred by the Company in relation to
interest paid on a £5.9 million shareholder loan from HoldCo to the Company; (iv) as of and for
the three months ended March 31, 2020, related to the balance of a shareholder loan from HoldCo
to its shareholder and cash on balance sheet held under HoldCo’s name, which amounted to £2.1
million and £1.5 million, respectively, and a £5.7 million shareholder loan from HoldCo to the

Company and (v) as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2021, related to the balance of a
shareholder loan from HoldCo to Deuce TopCo Limited and cash on balance sheet held under
HoldCo’s name, which amounted to £2.2 million and £1.4 million, respectively, and a £6.0 million
shareholder loan from HoldCo to the Company. As such differences are not material, the financial
and operating results and certain other information relating to HoldCo have been presented in lieu
of the Company. We believe that HoldCo’s consolidated financial statements, subject to the
differences noted above, adequately reflect the Company’s consolidated financial results and
financial position for the applicable periods.

(1) The impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 excluding deferred tax on our consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2019,
comprised (i) an increase in total assets of £669.5 million comprising the recognition of right-of-use assets in an amount of £883.1 million,
partially offset by the de-recognition of £204.7 million of finance lease assets and a reduction in intangible assets of £8.9 million resulting
from the de-recognition of the lease assets below market rent and (ii) an increase in total liabilities of £582.6 million comprising £827.7
million in respect of lease liabilities, partially offset by the de-recognition of £26.2 million of non-cash rental accruals, £170.5 million of
finance lease liabilities and £48.4 million of provisions related to onerous lease contracts and leases above market rent.

(2) Restated. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we identified that both deferred tax asset balances and reserves had been understated by
£21 million as of December 31, 2019. As a result, we have restated the consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2019.
The Group adopted IFRS 16 Leases retrospectively from January 1, 2019, but did not restate comparatives for the 2018 reporting period, as
permitted under the specific transition provisions in the standard. The adjustments arising from the new leasing rules were therefore recognized
in the opening balance sheet on January 1, 2019. There were no errors related to the adoption of IFRS 16 itself. The error was restricted to the
deferred tax calculation. The misstatement of the deferred tax balances related to the complexities of the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases
retrospectively from January 1, 2019. The effect on the consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2019 was to increase
the opening January 1, 2019 deferred tax assets by £21 million and to reduce accumulated losses as of January 1, 2019 by £21 million.

**Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations**

_The following discussion and analysis provide information that we believe is relevant to_

_an assessment and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations for the_
_periods under review and should be read together with our selected historical consolidated_
_financial and other data. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to_
_numerous risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated_
_in forward-looking statements for many reasons. See “Forward-looking statements” and “Risk_
_factors” for a discussion of important factors to be evaluated in connection with an investment in_
_the Notes._

_In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments in the U.K. and in all European_

_countries in which we operate have implemented strict social distancing measures with varying_
_degrees of lockdowns and closures of non-essential businesses, including leisure facilities such as_
_ours. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented disruption to our business, and the_
_wide variations in potential outcomes present a material challenge to our business and our_
_industry. We took action early in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and we continue to take_
_every step that we believe is prudent to protect and manage our clubs, reduce our cost base and_
_protect our operating cash flows. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, it is not possible to_
_accurately predict the medium- or long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business_
_and our industry, which will depend on factors outside of our control._

_In this section, unless the context otherwise requires, the term “Group,” “we,” “us” and_

_“our” refers to Holdco and its consolidated subsidiaries._

**Overview**

We are the leading premium lifestyle club operator in Europe based on revenue for the year

ended December 31, 2019. On a pro forma run-rate adjusted basis, pre-COVID-19 pandemic, we
had approximately 668 thousand members as of December 31, 2019. As of March 31, 2021 we
operated 99 clubs in the U.K., one club in the Republic of Ireland and 22 clubs in continental
Europe. Our mission is to provide high-quality destinations suitable for the whole family and all
age ranges with an emphasis on the quality of our offering and expert delivery of multiple products
and services, creating a sense of belonging and improving our members’ lives. Our clubs are places
for me-time, together-time, work, rest and play-time under one roof, improving the lives of our
members and providing a home away from home under our “My Club for My Life” ethos.

We differentiate ourselves from our competitors by blending our distinguished social

offerings with our market-leading sports and leisure facilities and fitness offerings, allowing us to
cultivate a loyal and “sticky” membership base. Our club rooms and outdoor spaces encourage
member interaction and provide a social, destination environment where members can relax and
socialize in a vibrant setting. The breadth and quality of our offering allows us to attract and retain
members of all ages, including families and older demographics, whom we believe are more likely
to become long-term members because our clubs become an integral part of their lives. We believe
our distinctive family focus, with programs and services catered to the whole family, enhances
member engagement, promotes membership retention and differentiates us from our competitors.
We believe that we have maintained markedly lower attrition rates than our peers, with a pre

-----

pandemic attrition rate of 32.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to up to
approximately 100% reported by certain low cost operators pre-pandemic (Source: public
_information), and the average membership tenure for our long-term members (i.e. those who had_
their membership for over 18 months) was seven years and our long-term members represented
63% of our member base, in each case, as of February 29, 2020 (excluding our Meridian clubs).
Based on the aggregate monthly membership fees paid by our long-term members for the month
February 2020, our aggregate implied recurring revenue over the seven year tenure would have
been approximately £1.9 billion. Our total membership subscription revenue, including joining
fees and administration fees, represented 78.2% of our total revenue for the year ended December
31, 2019. Our retail revenue generated by services such as our food and beverage offering,
childcare services and wellness products and our other revenue generated primarily by personal
training sessions and swimming and tennis tuition produce significant ancillary revenue and
represented 10.2% and 11.6%, respectively, of our total revenue in the year ended December 31,
2019.

Our business model focuses on operating a portfolio of strategically located clubs in

suburban areas, with each site situated in close proximity to an affluent demographic population.
Our clubs are well-invested and include heated indoor and outdoor pools, top-class racquet
facilities, well-equipped group exercise studios, state-of-the-art gyms, luxurious spas, crèches,
family-oriented club rooms and outdoor spaces, lounges with restaurants and bars as well as a fully
complementary digital offering, thereby delivering an outstanding customer experience to our
members. In addition, the range and breadth of services offered by our clubs results in longer
customer dwell-time, increased secondary spending, higher market penetration and improved
retention rates compared to our competitors.

While we operate mainly in the U.K., with 99 of our clubs located in the U.K. as of March

31, 2021, we see significant growth potential in Europe. Our recent acquisition of the eight
Meridian Group clubs in Germany has increased our penetration significantly into one of the most
important European markets. We expect to continue to consider additional international sites
through selective, value-enhancing strategic acquisitions of small portfolios as well as standalone
sites in Europe, in line with our overall growth plan. We believe that there are currently no
European competitors of significant scale in the premium health and fitness market segment, which
presents us an opportunity to capture additional market share through organic growth and
opportunistic acquisitions.

**_Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic_**

The First Lockdown

Prior to the First Lockdown, our business was performing on an upward growth trajectory,

with our latest annual price increase enacted in January 2020. Excluding the impact of the COVID19 pandemic, we generated £519.5 million of revenue, a loss of £51.5 million and £577.4 million
of Pro Forma Run Rate Revenue with a Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA of £170.9 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019. However, in March 2020, the governments of the U.K. and
of all European countries in which we operate imposed significant lockdown measures in order to
control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the temporary closure of almost all of
our clubs. During this First Lockdown, we decided not to charge members whilst their club was
closed, in line with our priority to retain members and treat them fairly. Consequently, almost all


-----

of our revenue ceased until the phased reopening of our clubs in Europe starting from June 3, 2020
and in the U.K. on July 25, 2020. Approximately 44 thousand members canceled their membership
during the First Lockdown, and, in contrast with the pre-COVID situation, we sold very few new
memberships because our clubs were closed, resulting in unusually high levels of net member loss
over the second half and in particular the second quarter of 2020. We also recorded negative
Adjusted EBITDA from March 2020 to July 2020.

During the First Lockdown, we reacted swiftly to minimize our costs reducing our pre-lock

down monthly operating cash outflow by 86% from £37.7 million to £5.3 million, primarily due to
cash savings from furloughing staff (£50 million in aggregate across the First Lockdown and the
Second Lockdown) and deferred rent savings (£53 million in aggregate across the First Lockdown
and the Second Lockdown) as presented in the following chart:

In addition to our costs saving initiatives, we focused on maximizing our members’

engagement and maintaining a dialogue with them. On March 23, 2020, we were one of the first
U.K. fitness, health and leisure operators to offer a remote exercise platform through the launch of
our “@home” mobile app. While memberships were frozen, we strove to keep our members
engaged with @home by offering them a weekly timetable of fitness classes and interactive events
and an extensive library of on-demand classes and tailored workout plans. Members used our
@home app not only for our signature fitness classes, but also for social events such as cooking
classes, quiz nights and make up tutorials. We also ensured that members who paid subscription
fees during months of partial closure were treated fairly by crediting their accounts with pro-rated
fees for the number of days we were closed. In addition, we kept an uninterrupted line of
communication with our members throughout the First Lockdown, giving them updates about our
reopening plans and new safety and hygiene protocols to be put in place in order to reassure them.
The success of our efforts to keep members engaged during the First Lockdown is evidenced by an
internal survey according to which 76% of them thought that the speed of communication was
“extremely good or very good” and 80.1% believed our implementation of government guidelines
was “extremely good or very good.” These high satisfaction rates served to reinforce our clubiness
and allowed us to minimize member loss during the First Lockdown to approximately 10% of our
total membership base, compared to approximately 27% for certain low-cost operators, according
to management estimates.


-----

Following the reopening of the majority of our clubs in August 2020 after the First

Lockdown, we recorded our highest ever monthly new membership sales between August 2020
and October 2020, surpassing month-on-month 2019 sales in August by 70% (29.8 thousand new
members), in September by 59% (32.0 thousand new members) and in October by 57% (26.9
thousand new members) and our prior best sales month (January 2018) in August by 28%, in
September by 37% and in October by 15% evidencing the strong demand for our offering and
services. Furthermore, monthly new membership sales in November 2020 and December 2020
were also on track to exceed month-on-month 2019 sales prior to the announcement of the Second
Lockdown. The following chart illustrates the success of our membership sales following the First
Lockdown:

The strong sales results of our clubs after the First Lockdown were recorded in spite of

fears of a looming Second Lockdown and the unavailability of vaccines at the time, which
demonstrates the appeal of our clubs where, in contrast to many of our competitors, we can
organize our activities outside and there is sufficient space to comply with social distancing rules
and COVID-19 protocols. After reopening in July 2020, based on an internal survey, our members
rated us 4.5 stars out of 5 stars for safety and wellbeing, which indicated our members and staff
felt comfortable coming back to our clubs.

Due to the recurring nature of our membership subscriptions revenue which we started

charging again upon reopening of our clubs after the First Lockdown, our business immediately
returned to profitability generating approximately £1 million, £7 million and £8 million of
Adjusted EBITDA in August, September and October 2020, respectively, as illustrated by the
following chart:


-----

The Second Lockdown

On October 31, 2020, the U.K. Prime Minister announced a second national lockdown,

which came into effect on November 5, 2020 and required the temporary re-closure of all of our
English clubs until December 2, 2020. By January 5, 2021, all of our clubs in England were forced
to close again as a result of the Second Lockdown being reinstated, with other U.K. and European
clubs following a similar pattern of closures and reopening (with the exception of two clubs in
Spain which remained open with certain operating restrictions). The chart below shows our total
number of clubs open throughout the First Lockdown and the Second Lockdown:

Consistent with our approach during the First Lockdown, club memberships in the U.K.

were frozen throughout the Second Lockdown, which led to our revenue almost ceasing during
this period. Our European clubs also generally followed the same approach. The higher number of
members leaving due to the closure of the majority of our clubs and the continued uncertainty
caused by the pandemic and our inability to sell new memberships, in contrast to pre-COVID-19
periods, resulted in a net member loss of approximately 51 thousand members during the Second
Lockdown. Based on our experience from the First Lockdown, we managed to minimize our
Adjusted EBITDA losses and cash burn during the Second Lockdown thanks to staff furloughs
and rent deferral negotiations.

April reopening

Following the Second Lockdown, the reopening of our clubs in England and Scotland has

been carried out on a staggered basis, with outdoor facilities reopening on March 29, 2021 and
indoor facilities reopening on April 12, 2021, followed by the full reopening of our Scottish clubs
on April 26, 2021. Based on recent government announcements, we anticipate the rest of our clubs
in Europe will start reopening from May 2021. Since the staggered reopening of our facilities at
the end of the Second Lockdown, our business has been performing very well. We believe that
this is partly because the more affluent segments of the population are relatively less impacted by
the COVID-19 pandemic and increased household saving rates are supporting a sustained period
of increased leisure spending. Our strong performance during April and May was also driven by
the fact that, as of March 31, 2021, 38% of our adult members were eligible for a vaccine jab on
the basis of age alone, and for those members who have elected to receive the vaccine it was safer
to return to our clubs, which was evidenced by this group accounting for 42% of attendance during
April 2021, despite making only 28% of our member count as of March 31, 2021. As of April 30,
2021, members who were 40 years and older were eligible for a vaccine jab, representing 60% of
our adult members. Furthermore, the suburban location of our clubs is allowing us to leverage the
new working-from-home trends, as members now have greater flexibility to visit our clubs during
the entire day, rather than at the usual pre- and post-working hours peak periods we used to observe
prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and some members are working from our clubs in
our business lounges.


-----

In addition, we believe that certain trends spurred on by the COVID-19 pandemic are likely

to bolster demand for our clubs, as travel restrictions in Europe will force households to look for
domestic leisure centers during the summer of 2021, while the potential closures of some of our
weaker competitors’ facilities will reduce overall market supply and correspondingly increase
demand for our services. Furthermore, research on the retail, consumer and leisure sectors from
Strategy& suggests that 80% of adults surveyed in the U.K. expect to be mindful or more mindful
about practicing regular self-care post-pandemic.

Our strong bounceback since the end of the Second Lockdown is evidenced by record new

membership sales, with 36.4 thousand new members added in April 2021 compared to 18.1
thousand new members in April 2019 at “normal” trading levels, representing an increase of 101%,
which led to a net member gain of approximately 27 thousand in April, while only 77% of our
clubs were open as of March 31, 2021 and only 84% of our clubs were open by the end of April
2021. We also recorded approximately 45 thousand new member sales between May 1 and May
31, 2021 compared to 18 thousand new members between May 1 and May 31, 2019, representing
an increase of approximately 150%. We believe that our new membership sales are likely to
continue to increase in the coming months as more clubs reopen and with key drivers of our
offering such as indoor group exercise, kids soft play, our indoor food and beverage offering and
sauna and steam rooms having resumed from May 17, 2021, allowing us to return to full capacity
in the U.K., while our European clubs also begin to reopen. Based on May 2021 levels, web traffic
(up 127.0% compared to March 2021) and web enquiries (up 218.8% compared to March 2021)
demonstrate a strong pipeline for June and July. Based on our all-time high new membership sales
and the pipeline data collected since the staggered reopening of our facilities at the end of the
Second Lockdown, we aim to reach our pre-pandemic membership base of 668 thousand members
by September 2021. The following chart illustrates our cumulative new membership sales since
March 1, 2021:

Many of our members canceled their membership during the First Lockdown and the

Second Lockdown and because our clubs were closed, we sold very few new memberships, in
contrast to normal pre-COVID-19 periods, as a result of which we had a net member loss of
approximately 94 thousand members between February 2020 and February 2021. However, our


-----

strong recovery in membership numbers since the staggered reopening of our facilities has allowed
us to recoup more than a third of these lost members in the months of March and April 2021, while
16% of our clubs had yet to reopen as of the end of April and the further relaxation of social
distancing measures in the U.K. expected to generate a further increase in membership growth, as
our indoor group exercise, kids soft play, indoor food and beverage and wellness offering have
resumed on May 17, 2021. The following chart illustrates our strong recovery in membership
numbers since February 2021:

The rapid bounceback of our membership numbers is expected to be further aided by lower

than normal attrition rates expected in the period June to September 2021 as 18% fewer members
have handed in a notice to terminate their membership as of May 31, 2021 compared to the same
position in 2019, and 22% fewer members lost during the same period compared to the 2019
position, as illustrated by the charts below:

Attrition pipeline as at 31[st] May Attrition as at 31[st] May

We expect our attrition levels in the next twelve months to remain lower compared to

normal pre-COVID-19 levels as a result of the lower sales during 2020, because historically an
element of our attrition is due to members cancelling their membership after the first year of joining
David Lloyd.

Our usage data since the end of the Second Lockdown is a further indicator of our strong

bounceback. Our average club usage from April 12, 2021 to May 30, 2021 was 28.4% higher than
it was following the reopening of our clubs at the end of the First Lockdown, which is testament
to the increasing appeal of our offering to members and increased consumer confidence. Since the
indoor facilities reopening on April 12, 2021, we have recorded an overall member attendance of
70.7%, with 70.2% of our adult membership base having attended our clubs.


-----

Due to the recurring nature of our membership subscriptions revenue which we started

charging again when our clubs reopened, the clubs that reopened immediately returned to
profitability. As a result, we expect our EBITDA to be positive again for May 2021.

The Issuer is a newly formed entity incorporated on May 6, 2021 for purposes of facilitating

the Transactions and performing certain activities related thereto. The Issuer is a wholly owned
direct subsidiary of the Company. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer has no
revenue-generating activities of its own, and no business operations, material assets or liabilities
other than those acquired or incurred in connection with its incorporation and the Transactions. As
a result, no historical financial information of the Issuer is included in this Offering Memorandum.

The Company was incorporated on May 18, 2018 as a holding company. The Company is

indirectly owned by Deuce Holdco Limited (“HoldCo”). As of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, the Company has no revenue-generating activities of its own, and no business
operations, material assets or liabilities other than (i) certain existing indebtedness which will be
repaid with the proceeds of the Transactions (see “Use of proceeds”) and (ii) a £2.0 million annual
monitoring fee payable to TDR Capital. As a result, no historical financial information of the
Company is included in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Historical Financial Information of Holdco_**

The consolidated historical and other financial data presented in this Offering

Memorandum have been derived from (i) the audited consolidated financial statements of HoldCo
as of and for the period from January 4, 2018 to December 31, 2018 and as of and for the years
ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, including the accompanying notes thereto, which have been
prepared in accordance with IFRS and which have been audited by Deloitte LLP and (ii) the
unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of HoldCo as of and for the three
months ended March 31, 2021, including accompanying notes thereto (with comparable financial
information for the three months ended March 31, 2020), which have been prepared in accordance
with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting, in each case included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum. References to the “Group,” “us” or “our” in the context of historical financial
information or other financial information relate to HoldCo and its subsidiaries. The audit reports
for the period from January 4, 2018 to December 31, 2018 and as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2020, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, express an
unqualified opinion for each of the respective periods and the audit report in relation to the audited
consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 include a
material uncertainty paragraph related to going concern as set forth in Note 2 to such financial
statements.

IFRS 16 (Leases) was published on January 13, 2016 by the International Accounting

Standard Board. It became effective on January 1, 2019 and applies to the first full financial year
commencing on or after that date. Our first full financial year following the effective date of IFRS
16 began on January 1, 2019, and we applied the modified retrospective approach of adopting the


-----

new standard, which did not require a restatement of comparative results for the financial period
ended December 31, 2018. On adoption of IFRS 16, the Group recognized lease liabilities in
relation to leases which had previously been classified as “operating leases” under the principles
of IAS 17. These liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments,
discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate as of January 1, 2019. The weighted
average lessee’s incremental borrowing rate applied to the lease liabilities on January 1, 2019 was
6.8%. For leases previously classified as “finance leases,” the carrying amount of the lease asset
and lease liability immediately before transition were recognized as the carrying amount of the
right-of-use asset and the lease liability at the date of initial application. For more information on
the adoption of IFRS 16 and the adjustments made in relation thereto, see “Management’s
_discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations—Factors affecting_
_comparability of our results of operations—Adoption of IFRS 16” and Note 33 to the HoldCo_
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, we identified that both deferred tax asset

balances and reserves had been understated by £21 million as of December 31, 2019. As a result,
we have restated the consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2019. As
mentioned above, the Group adopted IFRS 16 Leases retrospectively with the cumulative effect of
its application being recognized as of January 1, 2019, but did not restate comparatives for the
2018 reporting period, as permitted under the specific transition provisions in the standard. The
adjustments arising from the new leasing rules were therefore recognized in the opening balance
sheet on January 1, 2019. There were no errors related to the adoption of IFRS 16 itself. The error
was restricted to the deferred tax calculation. The misstatement of the deferred tax balances related
to the complexities of the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases retrospectively from January 1, 2019. There
is no impact on the consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the
effect on the consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2019 was to increase
the opening January 1, 2019 deferred tax assets by £21 million and to reduce accumulated losses
as of January 1, 2019 by £21 million.

In this Offering Memorandum, we present certain financial and other operating data as of

and for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition to its usefulness as regards our historical
performance, this data represents the ordinary course operations of our business in a steady state,
before the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have also presented the historical financial and
other operating data as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the three months ended
March 31, 2021, which represents the impact on our business of the COVID-19 pandemic as the
majority of our clubs were closed during the First Lockdown and the Second Lockdown (each as
defined herein).

Our consolidated financial statements include the results of operations and financial

position of HoldCo, which are not attributable to the Company or its subsidiaries. As a result, the
consolidated financial statements of HoldCo are not directly comparable to the historical financial
information of the Company and its subsidiaries, which is prepared in accordance with IFRS. The
main differences between the consolidated financial position and results of operations of HoldCo
and the Company (i) as of and for the period from January 4, 2018 to December 31, 2018, related
to interest income in relation to shareholder loans from HoldCo to its direct and indirect
shareholders and cash on balance sheet held under HoldCo’s name, which amounted to £2.3
million and £1.0 million, respectively, and a shareholder loan from HoldCo to the Company which


-----

amounted to £5.9 million; (ii) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, related to the
balance of a shareholder loan from HoldCo to its shareholder and cash on balance sheet held under
HoldCo’s name, which amounted to £2.1 million and £1.5 million, respectively, and £0.2 million
additional finance cost incurred by the Company in relation to interest paid on a £5.3 million
shareholder loan from HoldCo to the Company; (iii) as of and for the year ended December 31,
2020, related to the balance of a shareholder loan from HoldCo to its shareholder and cash on
balance sheet held under HoldCo’s name, which amounted to £2.2 million and £1.4 million,
respectively, and £0.1 million additional finance cost incurred by the Company in relation to
interest paid on a £5.9 million shareholder loan from HoldCo to the Company; (iv) as of and for
the three months ended March 31, 2020, related to the balance of a shareholder loan from HoldCo
to its shareholder and cash on balance sheet held under HoldCo’s name, which amounted to £2.1
million and £1.5 million, respectively, and a £5.7 million shareholder loan from HoldCo to the
Company and (v) as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2021, related to the balance of a
shareholder loan from HoldCo to Deuce TopCo Limited and cash on balance sheet held under
HoldCo’s name, which amounted to £2.2 million and £1.4 million, respectively, and a £6.0 million
shareholder loan from HoldCo to the Company. As such differences are not material, the financial
and operating results and certain other information relating to HoldCo have been presented in this
Offering Memorandum in lieu of the Company. We believe that HoldCo’s consolidated financial
statements, subject to the differences noted above, adequately reflect the Company’s consolidated
financial results and financial position for the applicable periods.

**Factors affecting comparability of our results of operations**

**_Adoption of IFRS 16_**

IFRS 16 (Leases) was published on January 13, 2016 by the International Accounting

Standard Board. It became effective on January 1, 2019 and applies to the first full financial year
commencing on or after that date. Our first full financial year following the effective date of IFRS
16 began on January 1, 2019, and we applied the modified retrospective approach of adopting the
new standard, which did not require a restatement of comparative results for the financial period
ended December 31, 2018.

On adoption of IFRS 16, the Group recognized lease liabilities in relation to leases which

had previously been classified as “operating leases” under the principles of IAS 17. These
liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using
the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate as of January 1, 2019. The weighted average lessee’s
incremental borrowing rate applied to the lease liabilities on January 1, 2019 was 6.8%. For leases
previously classified as “finance leases,” the carrying amount of the lease asset and lease liability
immediately before transition were recognized as the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset and
the lease liability at the date of initial application.

Due to the high number of leased assets that the Group holds, the application of IFRS 16

resulted in a right-of-use asset of £904.4 million and a lease liability of £838.5 million on our
statement of financial position as of January 1, 2019. The adjustments recognized in our statement
of financial position on January 1, 2019 as a result of the adoption of IFRS 16 are as follows:

thereto, see Note 33 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019
and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020.

**Key factors affecting our results of operations**

Our operations and the operating metrics discussed below have been, and may continue to

be, affected by certain key factors as well as certain historical events and actions. The key factors
affecting the ordinary course of our business and our results of operations are discussed below.

**_Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic_**

For the reasons discussed above under “—Recent developments—Impact of the COVID-19

_pandemic,” we expect our financial condition and results of operations to differ in respect of the_
current year and for future periods when compared to the 2018, 2019 and 2020 historical financial
condition and results of operation presented in this discussion.

**_Capital expenditures_**

We distinguish three types of capital expenditures: Pipeline Capital Expenditure,

Investment Capital Expenditure and Maintenance Capital Expenditure.

Pipeline Capital Expenditure is the discretionary spend relating to the expansion of our

facilities through the development or acquisition of new sites. Opening new clubs requires


-----

significant upfront investment, whether we are refitting existing facilities or building them anew,
including pre-opening costs such as legal and other costs associated with lease negotiation and
permitted use requirements. The costs we incur in connection with the opening of new clubs are
especially significant because of the premium segment of the health and fitness industry in which
we operate. It takes a club typically three to four full years of operations to reach Adjusted
EBITDA maturity. We follow a selective, value-enhancing approach towards new club
acquisitions and developments, targeting a minimum unlevered return on our investment-related
capital expenditures of 15 to 20% when we look to acquire a freehold property. The initial upfront
capital cost for new clubs was £8.8 million for the period ended January 3, 2018, relating to
investments in our Aravaca, Harrogate and Malaspina clubs, £25.4 million for the period ended
December 31, 2018, relating to investments in our Harrogate, Acton Park, Malaspina, Geneva,
Emersons Green and Bad Homburg clubs, £19.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019,
relating to investments in our Emersons Green, Bad Homburg, Bicester, Acton Park and Geneva
clubs and £0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, relating to investments in our Bad
Homburg club. See also “—Acquisitions.”

Investment Capital Expenditure is the discretionary spend comprising refurbishment works

and club upgrades that improve an existing club’s offering, resulting in increased satisfaction rates,
membership count and membership yields. In addition, Investment Capital Expenditure also
relates to new developments and investments in our clubs, such as the development of group
exercise spaces such as our Blaze studios, extensive refits and the development of spa facilities,
all of which serve to improve our product offering, enhance the quality of our services and increase
member satisfaction. Our Investment Capital Expenditure was £21.9 million for the period ended
January 3, 2018 relating primarily to refits of our newly acquired Virgin Active clubs, £17.7
million (or 3.7% of our total revenue) for the period ended December 31, 2018 relating primarily
to the rollout of our Blaze Studios, £38.2 million (or 7.4% of our total revenue) for the year ended
December 31, 2019 relating primarily to extensive refits of our Cambridge, Chigwell and
Warrington clubs and the rollout of our Spa Retreats and £4.5 million (or 1.7% of our total revenue)
for the year ended December 31, 2020 relating primarily to the Spa Retreats being added to our
Northwood and Cheadle clubs. Our refurbishment program conducted from 2013 to 2017 equipped
us with a well-invested estate and has delivered returns of more than 40% on our investments.
Phase 1 of our investment plan was completed in 2014 and comprised a £22.1 million investment
into 18 clubs, an average of £1.2 million per club. Phase 2 was completed in 2015 and comprised
a £18.8 million investment into 18 clubs, with an average of £1 million per club. Phase 3 was
completed in 2016 and comprised a £32.4 million investment into 41 clubs, with an average of
£800,000 per club. We achieved a 43% return on investment from phase 1 with an increase of £9.5
million in club Adjusted EBITDAR for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, a 42% return on
investment from phase 2 with an increase of £7.9 million in club Adjusted EBITDAR for twelve
months ended June 30, 2017 and a 48% return on investment from phase 3 with an increase of
£15.5 million in club Adjusted EBITDAR for the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, in each case
compared to the club Adjusted EBITDAR for the twelve months ended prior to the investment of
the capital expenditure. Investment Capital Expenditure typically allows us to increase our average
yield above RPI levels, increase our number of members and improve our membership mix, in
each case at the relevant clubs. For example, following the Investment Capital Expenditure spent
on the rollout of our Spa Retreats, we introduced a more expensive “Spa Retreat” membership
package, and following the rollout of our Blaze studios, we told new members that they had to
purchase our “platinum” membership package in order to access the Blaze studios, leading in each


-----

case to an increased average yield for the relevant clubs. In addition, these investments attracted
new members and encouraged existing members to subscribe to more expensive packages, thereby
bolstering our membership mix.

Maintenance Capital Expenditure is our spend required to keep our facilities at a high

standard and to support our back-office services, such as IT and network services. Maintenance
Capital Expenditure includes expenses related to kitting out our facilities with the latest, highestquality equipment and replacing such equipment on a regular basis, undertaking cyclical
refurbishment programs (on average, every seven years per club) in order to retain freshness in
club appearance and provision for identified dilapidations and emergency repair works. We believe
the maintenance and refurbishments works funded by Maintenance Capital Expenditure help us to
justify increasing our average yield at RPI levels.

Management estimates the required through-cycle requirement for Maintenance Capital

Expenditure to range from 5.5% to 6.0% of mature revenue per annum. Our Maintenance Capital
Expenditure is driven by the usage of our facilities and the mix of new and old clubs. Our
Maintenance Capital Expenditure was £19.8 million for the period ended January 3, 2018, £26.3
million for the period ended December 31, 2018, £28.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2019 and £21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Between 2017 and 2019, our
Maintenance Capital Expenditure represented 5.2%, on average, of our yearly total revenue. In
2020, we incurred approximately £1.2 million in capital expenditure in connection with the
installation of sanitizing devices and temperature sensors in our clubs to ensure compliance with
the latest COVID-19 safety protocols. While Maintenance Capital Expenditure is required in order
to run our business, it can also be decreased significantly during a set period of time without a
major impact on the business, which offers us additional flexibility in managing our capital
expenditures.

**_Membership volumes_**

We derive the vast majority of our revenue from membership subscriptions revenue

(78.2%, 78.2% and 80.4% of our total revenue in the period ended December 31, 2018 and the
years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020) paid by our club members, which includes
administration and joining fees. We also generate ancillary revenue, including retail revenue from
our food and beverage offering, childcare, wellness and miscellaneous sources such as
merchandizing sales and other revenue from personal training sessions, swimming and tennis
tuition. See “Description of key income statement items—Revenue.” Ancillary revenue (including
retail and other revenue) represented 21.8%, 21.8% and 19.6% of our revenue in the period ended
December 31, 2018 and the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020. Accordingly, each of the
categories of our revenue is significantly dependent on membership volumes. Membership
volumes are affected by numerous factors, including the total number of clubs in operation, the
price of our membership offerings, the sizes and locations of our clubs and competitive dynamics
in the premium club market, among others. Our membership volumes and revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2020 were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. See “—Recent
_developments—Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.”_

Our membership has grown from 608,602 members as of December 31, 2018 to 626,120

members as of December 31, 2019, representing a CAGR of 2.9%. This growth has been driven


-----

primarily by existing business, the organic rollout of our clubs in the U.K., the maturation of
recently opened clubs and the acquisition of high-value club portfolios in Europe. Due to the
uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the closure of our clubs during 2020, our
membership has declined in 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 from 626,120 members as of
December 31, 2019 to approximately 580,005 as of March 31, 2021. This negative trend resulting
from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was partly offset when our clubs reopened at the end
of the First Lockdown. We recorded our highest ever monthly new membership sales between
August 2020 and October 2020, which resulted in a net member gain of approximately three
thousand members between August 2020 and October 2020.

The following table sets forth the evolution of our membership across our club portfolio as

at the dates indicated:

**As of December 31,** **As of April 30,**

**2018** **2019** **2020** **2021**

Members in the U.K. ......................... 540,200 553,869 504,086 513,459

Members in Germany ........................ 2,028 3,280 40,027 39,202

Members in the Netherlands .............. 32,220 32,940 25,679 23,864

Members in Belgium ......................... 12,063 12,374 10,224 10,038

Members in Spain .............................. 8,233 8,499 7,193 7,386

Members in Ireland............................ 7,275 7,313 6,310 5,930

Members in France ............................ 3,848 4,447 3,649 3,423

Members in Italy ............................... 2,735 3,398 2,669 2,708

Members in Switzerland .................... — — 1,250 1,381

**608,602** **626,120** **601,087** **607,391**
**Total number of members ..............**

**_Average yield_**

Our revenue is also dependent on the membership fees we charge as part of our

membership subscription revenue, as 76.6% and 77.2% of our total revenue in the period ended
December 31, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, was generated from
membership fees, excluding administration and joining fees. Growth in our membership fees is
driven by an increasing average yield, which represents the average monthly membership fee paid
per member calculated by dividing the total membership fees received in a period by the average
member count for such period and by dividing the result thereof by 12. Our average yield is a
function of the prices we charge for membership packages and the mix of membership packages
sold.

Our average yield for the period ended December 31, 2018 and the year ended December

31, 2019 on a like-for-like basis was £52.6 and £54.3. We do not present like-for-like average
monthly yield for the year ended December 31, 2020 because our membership fees were frozen
for a significant part of such period due to the COVID-19 pandemic, while our average member
count did not substantially fluctuate during such period. We therefore believe that like-for-like
average monthly yield for the year ended December 31, 2020 was not representative of what our
like-for-like average monthly yield would have been if we had not frozen our membership fees
during such period.


-----

The below chart shows the yearly evolution of our average yield and its correlation to our

total number of members on a like-for-like basis:

We are dependent on our ability to charge fees at a level that allows us to attract and retain

members while also maintaining the most profitable member mix in order to generate an
appropriate fee yield. Membership fees are set locally on a club-by-club basis based on the local
demographics and varying levels of affluence of the areas in which we operate ensuring the optimal
number of members per club and taking into account the price elasticity of members of the
respective club. In general, during the periods under review we have been able to increase our
membership fees on a yearly basis above RPI levels without increasing attrition, mainly due to
high customer satisfaction as our members value the high standard and improved offering of our
facilities resulting from our Maintenance Capital Expenditure and Investment Capital Expenditure.

**_Fixed operating costs_**

We benefit from high operating leverage resulting from our fixed cost base. Our costs are

split across cost of sales, administrative expenses and other operating expenses. In December 2020,
we implemented our Fit For Growth Program which is expected to yield approximately £10 million
of annual labor cost savings from 2021 onwards compared to our labor costs for the year ended
December 31, 2019. The program was implemented following a full review of club structures,
duty manager shifts and benchmarking of departmental hours as well as an increased focus on
digital solutions to cut down on certain of our staff and overhead costs. While cost control is
important, our primary focus is on delivering a best in class service for our members.

_Cost of sales_

Cost of sales represents the costs involved in generating all retail and other revenue,

including food and beverage consumables, staff for all sports lessons and personal training sessions
and stock costs incurred in connection with product sales, whether online or onsite.

Our staff costs include costs related to personal coaches and fitness specialists, sales teams,

service personnel, as well as a host of freelance class instructors, some of which create additional
costs that our competitors in the value and mid-market segments of the market can typically avoid.
Our staff costs generally increase as a result of growing headcount and inflation. Staff costs within
our cost of sales grew from £59.6 million for the period ended January 3, 2016 to £84.1 million
for the period ended December 31, 2019.

Our food and beverage consumable and stock costs in connection with product sales are

related to our ancillary revenue and increase or decrease depending on the fluctuation of our


-----

ancillary revenue. Costs related to our food and beverage consumable and stock costs grew from
£32.2 million, including £0.1 million of overheads, for the period ended January 3, 2016 to £46.0
million, including £0.1 million of overheads, for the period ended December 31, 2019.

_Administrative expenses_

Administrative expenses comprise the costs incurred in administering our operations,

including head office and operational overheads, marketing, insurance, professional fees, credit
card and bank charges as well as IT and office costs. We employ a number of marketing
professionals in our home office to increase brand awareness and recognition. In recent years, we
have made substantial investments into our head office in order to facilitate continued innovation
and differentiation, to gain more control over our information technology system and ensure that
our management and technology infrastructure are sufficient to support our existing clubs as well
as our future growth plans.

Our operational overheads included in the administrative expenses generally increase as a

result of growing headcount and inflation. Our operational overheads within our administrative
expenses grew from £7.6 million for the period ended January 3, 2016 to £9.5 million for the
period ended December 31, 2019.

Our club support costs included in the administrative expenses relate to professional fees

and office costs. Our club support costs within our administrative expenses grew from £26.8
million for the period ended January 3, 2016 to £31.3 million for the period ended December 31,
2019.

_Other operating expenses_

Other operating expenses comprise expenses related to rent costs, business rates, utilities,

cleaning and laundry, depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible
assets as well as maintenance and repairs and exceptional items.

Our rent costs include costs related to our real estate leases and constituted £53.3 million

for the period ended January 3, 2016, on an adjusted basis to reflect £16.0 million of additional
rent costs payable following the completion of the sale and leaseback of a portfolio of clubs to
M&G, and £63.3 million for the period ended December 31, 2018. Rent costs as they would have
been recorded under IAS 17 were £72.7 million and £73.6 million, respectively, for the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2020, representing 13.1%, 14.2% and 28.4% of our revenue for the period
ended December 31, 2018 and the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020. On a like-for-like
basis, our rent costs constituted £58.2 million for the period ended December 31, 2018 and £58.9
million and £58.9 million as they would have been recorded under IAS 17 for the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2020. Increases in rent costs were primarily driven by inflation.

Our other costs, including overheads and club support costs, included in the other operating

expenses are generally consistent across all our clubs and do not typically vary significantly on an
individual basis. Such costs relate to cleaning and maintenance expenses which are driven by the
number of clubs, usage of our equipment and inflation. The business rates we pay are reviewed on
a 5-year cycle. We aim to control our operating costs through the efficient use of our utilities, such


-----

as lighting and waste management, and we evaluate the terms of our contracts with our utility
providers on an ongoing basis. Our overheads within our other operating expenses grew from
£67.2 million for the period ended January 3, 2016 to £100.7 million for the period ended
December 31, 2019. Our club support costs within our other operating expenses grew from £0.6
million for the period ended January 3, 2016 to £0.7 million for the period ended December 31,
2019.

Our staff costs included in the other operating expenses include costs related to our

maintenance and service personnel. Our staff costs within our other operating expenses grew from
£20.4 million for the period ended January 3, 2016 to £32.3 million for the period ended December
31, 2019.

Depreciation for the period ended December 31, 2018 includes depreciation of land and

buildings and equipment and constituted £43.9 million. Depreciation for the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2020 includes depreciation of land and buildings and equipment and rightof-use assets and constituted £77.0 million and £73.1 million. Increases in our depreciation over
the periods under review were mainly driven by the impact of IFRS 16. Amortization includes
amortization of goodwill, brands, software & licenses and leasehold health clubs intangibles and
constituted £8.0 million, £11.3 million and £8.0 million for the period ended December 31, 2018
and the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020.

Exceptional items include impairment of property, plant and equipment, impairment of

right-of-use assets, impairment of intangible assets, costs of lease re-negotiations, business
restructuring, acquisition related costs, impairment of investment and India joint venture losses.
Exceptional items constituted £13.0 million, £14.4 million and £37.8 million for the period ended
December 31, 2018 and the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020. The increase in exceptional
items in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was
due to our costs incurred in relation to our lease re-negotiations during the year which we did not
incur in 2019 and a larger impairment recorded on our right-of-use assets as a result of the impact
of COVID-19 following our annual impairment review in 2020.

_Like-for-like data_

Our like-for-like staff costs grew at a CAGR of 3.6% from £79 million for the

period ended January 3, 2016 to £91 million for the period ended December 31, 2019. Our likefor-like overheads grew at a CAGR of 4.3% from £73 million for the period ended January 3, 2016
to £87 million for the period ended December 31, 2019. Our like-for-like club support grew at a
CAGR of 4.4% from £27 million for the period ended January 3, 2016 to £32 million for the period
ended December 31, 2019. Our rent costs grew at a CAGR of 2.8% from £53 million for the period
ended January 3, 2016 to £59 million for the period ended December 31, 2019.

**_Acquisitions_**

In the periods under review, we made certain acquisitions which have affected our results

of operations. We proactively manage our club portfolio by pursuing value-enhancing strategic
acquisitions of small portfolios as well as standalone sites in Europe, in line with our overall
growth plan. Our most recent significant acquisitions are:


-----

- Virgin Active: in June 2017, we acquired 14 U.K. racquet clubs with approximately 74
thousand members from Virgin Active, one of our direct competitors, for a purchase price of
£62.9 million which was paid on May 31, 2017. The Adjusted EBITDA generated by these 14
Virgin Active clubs has more than doubled since our acquisition, from £8.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 2017 to £18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 (on a pro
forma run rate adjusted basis).

- Bad Homburg: in June 2018, we expanded our operations into the German market with the
purchase of a HealthCity-branded club in Bad Homburg, near Frankfurt, for a purchase price
of approximately £1.6 million, which was paid on June 1, 2018.

- Meridian: in January 2020, we acquired the Hamburg Meridian Group, which operates eight
premium health and spa clubs in Germany, for a purchase price of approximately £69.0 million,
which was paid on January 30, 2020.

- Geneva: in September 2020, we purchased a country club in the affluent, high-potential
Bellevue suburb of Geneva in Switzerland, for a purchase price of approximately £9 million,
which was paid on September 30, 2020.

**_Changing consumer preferences and prevailing macroeconomic conditions_**

Our financial results are impacted by changes in consumer habits and preferences within

the U.K. and Europe. Examples of changes in consumer habits that have favorably impacted our
financial performance include long-term growth in the eating-out market, focus on overall
customer experience, fitness and wellbeing being perceived as an essential rather than
discretionary expenditure, the growing appeal of working-from-home arrangements and an
increase in popularity of clubs attracting entire families. On the other hand, if members’
preferences evolve in such a way that outdoor activities such as cycling, running, team sports,
weights, fitness apps or other online programs at home become favored at the expenses of purposebuilt health and fitness facilities, particularly in light of consumer behavior during the COVID-19
pandemic, we are likely to experience a decline in our revenue. See “Industry.” Because changes
in consumer preferences and trends have historically impacted our financial results, we strive to
anticipate, identify and respond to such changes by evolving our brands and offering adequately
and in a timely fashion.

Changes in the general macroeconomic environment may also have an impact on the appeal

of our clubs. The outlook for the U.K. economy is currently subject to significant uncertainty,
particularly in light of the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit, which may lead
the U.K. into a prolonged period of economic downturn, recession or depression. Our business is
also subject to macroeconomic factors such as interest rates, disposable income, unemployment
rates, taxes, consumer credit levels and house prices, which has a bearing on the level of consumer
confidence and, in turn, the level of consumer spending on eating and drinking out and other leisure
activities.

**Description of key income statement items**

**_Revenue_**

Revenue is derived from the provision of goods and services across the full range of our

differentiated offering, including our state-of-the-art gyms, swimming pools, racquet facilities,
group exercise studios, luxurious spas as well as our restaurants and bars. Revenue is measured at
the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for
goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other
sales-related taxes. Our revenue stems from two main sources: membership subscriptions and
ancillary revenue. Ancillary revenue is split into six categories, which are, in descending order of
importance: food and beverage, personal training sessions, swimming and tennis tuition, childcare,
wellness and miscellaneous.

- Membership subscriptions revenue:

`o` Membership fees: can be paid annually in full or monthly by direct debit. Subscriptions
are recognized over the period of the membership, with any subscriptions received in
advance of the period in which the service is provided being recorded as a contract
liability on the statement of financial position.

`o` Administration and joining fees: are paid upfront and are non-refundable. They
represent a fee for the initial set-up costs of the contract and for the right to renew the
membership for no additional fee when such contract expires. Revenue is recognized
over the average membership period, when performance obligations are performed,
including any period of renewal. Revenue relating to future periods of membership are
recognized as contract liabilities in the statement of financial position.

- Ancillary revenue:

`o` Food and beverage (retail revenue): food and beverage is the largest contributor of our
total ancillary revenue, with a strong growth supported by frequent menu changes and
frequent investments into our facilities.

`o` Personal training (other revenue): personal training demand continues to grow as more
members partake in our “PT Journey” program. Personal training sessions are paid for
monthly by direct debit, via @home or on the date they are taken. The revenue is
recognized in the month they are paid for, because this is when the performance
obligation is satisfied. The period over which this revenue should be recognized
requires judgement. See “—Critical accounting estimates and judgments.” Revenue
received in relation to future periods is recognized as a contract liability on the
statement of financial position.

`o` Tuition (other revenue): swimming and tennis lessons are predominately driven by
children’s coaching lessons, with growth generated by the increasing mix of children
in our membership base. Swimming and tennis lessons are paid for upfront at the
beginning of the term or monthly by direct debit. Revenue is recognized over the period


-----

that lessons are provided, and any upfront payment is recognized as a contract liability
on the statement of financial position.

`o` Childcare (other revenue): comprises all of our child-oriented products and services,
including children’s parties, crèche services and “David Lloyd Holiday Camps,” which
have all been growing as a result of our increased child count and longer crèche
operating hours.

`o` Wellness (other revenue): includes all revenue generated through our high-quality wet
spa facilities, our full range of onsite treatments, including aromatherapy, massage,
acupuncture and beauty treatments, physiotherapy and physical rehabilitation services
with qualified physiotherapists as well as a select number of Spa Retreats.

`o` Miscellaneous (retail revenue): represents revenue from sales and other merchandise,
whether sold online or from our physical premises, including nutritional educational
programs, hairdressers, barbers, beauty care and various on-demand tutorials offered
in the form of “pop-up” stands on our premises, for which revenue is always recognized
at the point of sale.

**_Cost of sales_**

Cost of sales represents the costs involved in generating all ancillary revenue, including

food and beverage consumables, labor for all sports lessons and personal training sessions and
stock costs incurred in connection with product sales, whether online or onsite.

**_Gross profit_**

Gross profit is calculated as revenue less cost of sales.

**_Other income_**

Other income relates to support funds received from government grants in the U.K. and

Europe, which are not recognized until there is reasonable assurance that we will comply with the
conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received. Government grants are
recognized in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which we recognize expenses
related to the costs for which the grants are intended to compensate.

**_Administrative expenses_**

Administrative expenses comprise the costs incurred in administering our operations,

including head office and operational labor costs, marketing, insurance, professional fees, credit
card and bank charges as well as IT and office costs.


-----

**_Other operating expenses_**

Other operating expenses comprise expenses related to rent costs, business rates, utilities,

cleaning and laundry, depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible
assets as well as maintenance and repairs.

**_Profit/(loss) on disposals of PP&E_**

Profit/(loss) on disposals of PP&E includes the gain or loss arising on the disposal or

scrappage of an asset, which is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the
carrying amount of the relevant asset.

**_Operating profit_**

Operating profit is calculated as gross profit less administrative expenses, other operating

expenses and profit/loss on disposals of PP&E.

**_Net finance costs_**

Net finance costs are finance costs net of finance income. Finance costs represent interest

on bank loans, notes, lease liabilities, amortization of debt issue costs, and certain other interest
expenses. Finance costs are recognized using the effective interest method. Finance income
represents interest accrued on our overnight bank deposits, which we recognize as it accrues using
the effective interest method.

**_Income tax credit on ordinary activities_**

Income tax credit on ordinary activities comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is

the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the relevant period, using
tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable
or receivable in respect of previous years. Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes
and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is recognized, without discounting, in
respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting
purposes which have arisen but not been reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise
required by International Accounting Standard 12.

_Revenue_

Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was £2.4 million, a decrease of £116.6

million, or 97.8%, compared to £119.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The
decrease was primarily due to the fact that almost all of our clubs were closed and club
memberships were frozen during the Second Lockdown, which led to our revenue almost ceasing
during this period. The £2.4 million revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021 related to
two of our Spanish clubs that remained open during the period and four days of revenue from 12
UK clubs which were open in the beginning of January prior to the national lockdown on the 5[th]

of January 2021.

Prior to the First Lockdown, our business was performing on an upward growth trajectory,

with our latest annual price increase enacted in January 2020. Revenue for the two months ended
February 29, 2020 increased by £5.5 million or 6.5%, compared to revenue for the two months
ended February 28, 2019, due to a higher membership count (630 thousand members compared to
610 thousand members) and the annual price increase in January 2020.

_Cost of sales_

Cost of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was £17.1 million, a decrease of

£16.0 million, or 48.2%, compared to £33.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020.
The decrease was primarily due to the furlough of our personal trainers and tennis and swimming
coaches as well as less sales of food and beverages consumables and stock costs of product sales
due to the closure of our food and beverage offering and our clubs during the Second Lockdown.


-----

_Gross profit/loss_

Gross profit/loss for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was a loss of £14.7 million, a

above.

_Other income_

Other income for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was £18.2 million, an increase

of £15.6 million compared to £2.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase
was primarily due to a £15.1 million grant under the UK Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme.

decrease of £4.5 million, or 35.2%, compared to £12.8 million for the three months ended March

Lockdown.

of £3.3 million, or 8.8%, compared to £37.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020.
The increase was primarily due to additional interest payable as a result of our higher principal
amount outstanding on our loan notes due to the capitalized 5% PIK interest and interest payable
on our revolving credit facilities with Barclays and Lloyds which were fully drawn in the period
and lease liabilities.

_Income tax credit/charge on ordinary activities_

Income tax credit/charge on ordinary activities for the three months ended March 31, 2021

was a credit of £6.2 million, an increase of £11.7 million compared to a charge of £5.5 million for

-----

period in the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to a profit for the three months ended
March 31, 2020, and there being no impact of rate change on deferred tax during the quarter.

million, or 7.5%, compared to £483.4 million for the period ended December 31, 2018. The

openings, including Emersons Green, as well as the full year benefit from our Acton Park, Geneva
and Bad Homburg clubs, which all opened in 2018.

for the period ended December 31, 2018 to £413.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019
due to increases in membership subscriptions revenue and ancillary revenue.

4.2%, from £310.1 million for the period ended December 31, 2018 to £323.1 million for the year

£2.1 million or 2.4%, from £88.1 million for the period ended December 31, 2018 to £90.2 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the increase in the number of weeks in which we
provided kids lessons and the corresponding increase in tuition and a higher membership count.

_Cost of sales_

Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 were £130.2 million, an increase of

£4.1 million, or 3.3%, compared to £126.1 million for the period ended December 31, 2018. The

personal coaches and trainers for coaching sessions as well as tennis and swimming lessons.

increase of £3.3 million, or 7.3%, compared to £45.4 million for the period ended December 31,

office and various operational roles.

decrease of £12.5 million, or 4.8%, compared to £259.5 million for the period ended December

gym equipment.

£1.4 million, an increase of £1.8 million compared to a loss of £0.4 million for the period ended
December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to the disposal of certain gym equipment.

£43.2 million, or 83.3%, compared to £51.8 million for the period ended December 31, 2018. The
increase was primarily due to the increase in operating profit and the adoption of IFRS 16, which
was partially offset by additional staff costs and impairment charges.

_Net finance costs_

Net finance costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 were £148.6 million, an increase

of £72.4 million, or 94.9%, compared to £76.2 million for the period ended December 31, 2018.
The increase was primarily due to interest expense arising from the adoption of IFRS 16 and
additional interest expenses on our financing arrangements, which was partially offset by reduction
in amortization of loan arrangement fees and a reduction of our finance lease interest.

_Income tax credit on ordinary activities_

Income tax credit on ordinary activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was

£2.1 million, a decrease of £2.6 million, or 55.3%, compared to £4.7 million for the period ended
December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to increased current tax charge and decrease
in the deferred tax prior year adjustment credit.

increase of £31.9 million compared to £19.6 million for the period ended December 31, 2018. The
increase was primarily due to the factors described above.

**Liquidity and capital resources**

Our liquidity requirements are primarily related to the need to fund our debt servicing

requirements, working capital and investments in capital expenditure. Historically, our principal
sources of liquidity have been our net cash generated from operating activities and borrowings
under our financing arrangements, including, inter alios, the revolving credit facilities entered into
with Barclays Bank PLC and Lloyds Bank plc and certain loan notes issued by the Company to
Talos Capital Designated Activity Company, TCI REP INTERNATIONAL ICAV, an Irish
collective asset-management vehicle acting solely in respect of its sub-fund TCI REP
INTERNATIONAL FUND III and The Children’s Investment Master Fund as original
noteholders.


-----

Following the Transactions, our principal sources of liquidity will primarily be our net cash

generated from operating activities, proceeds from the Equity Contribution and borrowings under
the Notes and the New Revolving Credit Facility pursuant to the New Revolving Facilities
Agreement. The New Revolving Credit Facility, which we expect to be undrawn on the Issue Date,
will provide for an aggregate principal amount of up to £125.0 million in revolving credit and,
subject to certain exceptions and conditions, amounts may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed
thereunder at any time for general corporate purposes. For further information, see “Description
_of other financing arrangements—New Revolving Facilities Agreement.”_

After the completion of the Transactions, we will have £903.0 million equivalent in

aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding. The Issuer is a special purpose finance
subsidiary with no material operations or assets of its own. As a result, the Issuer will primarily
depend on the cash flow generated by the operating subsidiaries of the Group and paid to the Issuer
by way of interest payments under, or repayments of, intercompany loans, dividend distributions
or otherwise to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. The Issuer’s ability
to pay cash interest on the Notes offered hereby will be determined by its cash available for debt
service.

As of March 31, 2021, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, the Issuer and the

Guarantors would have had £903.0 million equivalent in aggregate principal amount of third party
financial indebtedness, excluding the £928.1 million of lease liabilities under IFRS 16, of which
£903.0 million equivalent was secured.

While we believe that following the Transactions we will have sufficient liquidity and

capital resources to meet our current operating requirements, our ability to generate cash depends
on our future operating performance, which is in turn dependent on a variety of factors, many of
which are beyond our control, as well as other factors discussed in the section titled “Risk factors.”
For further information, see the section titled “Capitalization.”

_Net cash flow from operating activities_

We used £12.9 million of cash in our operating activities for the three months ended March

31, 2021. The cash used in our operating activities was primarily attributable to a high loss for the
financial quarter and a £19.0 million increase in trade and other receivables, partially offset by a
£26.0 million increase in trade and other payables.

We generated £60.6 million of cash from our operating activities for the three months

ended March 31, 2020. The cash generated from our operating activities was primarily attributable
to a £26.2 million increase in trade and other payables, partially offset by a £4.4 million increase
in trade and other receivables.

We generated £81.9 million of cash from our operating activities for the period ended

December 31, 2020. The cash generated from our operating activities was primarily attributable to
a £65 million increase in trade and other payables, partially offset by a high loss for the year and

partially offset by a £2.4 million increase in trade and other receivables.

We generated £74.1 million of cash from our operating activities for the period ended

December 31, 2018. The cash generated from our operating activities was primarily attributable to
a low loss for the year and a £8.0 million decrease in trade and other receivables, partially offset
by a £33.1 million decrease in trade and other payables caused by the change in year-end for the
period from January 4, 2018 to December 31, 2018 and a correlated reduction in deferred income.

_Net cash flow from investing activities_

We used £2.0 million of cash in our investing activities for the three months ended March

31, 2021. The cash used in our investing activities was primarily attributable to a £1.8 million
payment for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment and certain transaction costs paid
related to right-of-use assets.

We used £10.7 million of cash in our investing activities for the three months ended March

31, 2020. The cash used in our investing activities was primarily attributable to the acquisition of
property, plant and equipment.

We used £3.0 million of cash in our investing activities for the year ended

December 31, 2020. The cash used in our investing activities was primarily attributable to a £25.7
million payment for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment and a £1.3 million payment
for the acquisition of intangible assets, in each case in relation to Spa Retreats being added to our

in connection with the sale of property, land and equipment.

We used £64.3 million of cash in our investing activities for the year ended

December 31, 2019. The cash used in our investing activities was primarily attributable to a £74.7
million payment for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment and a £7.6 million payment
for the acquisition of intangible assets, in each case in relation to extensive refits of our Cambridge,
Chigwell and Warrington clubs and the rollout of our Spa Retreats, which were partially offset by
proceeds from the sale of property, land and equipment.

We used £65.0 million of cash in our investing activities for the period ended

December 31, 2018. The cash used in our investing activities was primarily attributable to a £58.6
million payment for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment and a £4.6 million payment
for the acquisition of intangible assets, in each case in relation to the rollout of our Blaze Studios.

_Net cash flow from financing activities_

We used £15.4 million of cash in our financing activities for the three months ended March

31, 2021. The cash used in our financing activities was primarily attributable to £13.4 million of
interest paid in connection with our existing indebtedness.

We generated £9.3 million of cash from our financing activities for the three months ended

March 31, 2020. The cash generated from our financing activities was primarily attributable to £40
million of proceeds from our bank borrowings, which were partially offset by the repayment of
lease liabilities and interest paid in connection with our existing indebtedness.

December 31, 2020. The cash used in our financing activities was primarily attributable to £44.4
million of principal element of lease payments and £25.4 million of interest paid in connection
with our existing indebtedness, which were partially offset by proceeds from our bank borrowings.

We used £122.3 million of cash in our financing activities for the year ended

December 31, 2019. The cash used in our financing activities was primarily attributable to £72.6
million of principal element of lease payments and £48.2 million of interest paid in connection
with our existing indebtedness.

We used £19.5 million of cash in our financing activities for the period ended

December 31, 2018. The cash used in our financing activities was primarily attributable to £489.8
million used for the repayment of bank and former shareholder borrowings), £7.8 million used for
payments to finance lease creditors, £25.9 million interest paid in connection with our existing
indebtedness and £391.4 million of dividend payments, which were partially offset by proceeds
from our bank borrowings.

**Capital expenditures**

We distinguish three types of capital expenditures: Pipeline Capital Expenditure,

Investment Capital Expenditure and Maintenance Capital Expenditure. Pipeline Capital


-----

Expenditure is the discretionary spend relating to the expansion of our facilities through the
development or acquisition of new sites. Investment Capital Expenditure is the discretionary spend
comprising refurbishment works and club upgrades that improve an existing club’s offering,
resulting in increased satisfaction rates, membership count and membership yields. Maintenance
Capital Expenditure is our spend required to keep our facilities at a high standard and to support
our back-office services, such as IT and network services and is driven by the usage of our facilities
and the mix of new and old clubs. The table below sets forth our capital expenditures for the
periods indicated:

For the year ended December 31, 2022, we expect our Maintenance Capital Expenditure

to range from £25 million to £30 million. Depending on trading and market conditions, we may
choose to invest further Investment Capital Expenditure and/or Pipeline Capital Expenditure for
which the Group is confident it will be able to achieve returns in line with previous investment
history.

**Off balance sheet arrangements**

As of March 31, 2021, we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements other than our

commitment to purchase land for a new site in Bicester for an amount of £2.2 million.

**Contractual obligations**

the issuer (Meridian Mezzanine GmbH) and the holders to the end of each calendar year with a notice period of 6 months and
are guaranteed by Meridian Spa & Fitness Deutschland GmbH.

(2) As part of the Transactions, we expect to enter into a New Revolving Facilities Agreement on or about the Issue Date, which

will provide for a New Revolving Credit Facility of up to £125 million. Borrowings under the New Revolving Facilities
Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes, capital expenditures and working capital purposes. We expect the
New Revolving Facilities to be undrawn on the Issue Date.

(3) Represents (i) €300 million in aggregate principal amount of Euro Notes offered hereby, translated at an exchange rate of

principal amount of Sterling Notes offered hereby.

**Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk**

We are exposed to the following risks related to the use of financial instruments:

- liquidity risk;

- price risk;

- interest rate risk;

- foreign exchange risk;

- capital risk; and

- credit risk.

**_Liquidity risk_**

Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital, loan facilities and

the finance charges on our debt instruments. In order to ensure that the Group always has sufficient
cash to meet its liabilities, we seek to maintain cash balances (or agreed facilities) to meet expected
requirements according to predicted cash flows. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our
liquidity was significant. As a result, our liquidity in the next 12 months will be influenced by the
trading performance of clubs when open and any periods of club closure due to further disruption
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. During the First Lockdown and the Second Lockdown, we
had no income and operated with a monthly cash burn of approximately £5 million. The impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic on our business is considered a going concern, as further disclosed in
note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020.


-----

**_Price risk_**

We are exposed to increases in the price of electricity and gas. The Group manages its

exposure to electricity and gas price risk by purchasing its utility requirements in advance through
industry leading advisers. For 2021, 75% of our U.K. electricity volumes and 63% of our U.K. gas
volumes were purchased in advance. Unused utility volumes are sold back to the market, leaving
the Group liable for any losses due to lower pricing. We have recently extended our electricity
supply contract to October 2022.

Inflation risk is the risk that the cost of key services and products procured by the Group

will rise with inflation and affect the Group’s margin. A large proportion of the Group’s leasehold
rents are subject increases related to retail and consumer price indexed, which present an ongoing
risk. The Group has comprehensive cost control processes in place to ensure these inflation driven
risks are minimized.

If membership price changes do not reflect market sensitivities and elasticities, this may

result in a corresponding decrease in revenue and profit through higher attrition or eroded margins.
The Group has a comprehensive pricing policy which is reviewed annually to ensure this risk is
mitigated.

The Group’s U.K. employees are subject to the Working Time Regulations. On April 1,

2020, the national hourly living wage in the U.K. increased to £8.72 per hour for individuals aged
25 or more, and to £8.91 per hour for individuals aged 23 or more, effective from April 1, 2021.
In response, the Group has introduced a minimum hourly rate above both the national minimum
wage and the national living wage. On April 1, 2020, we increased our minimum hourly rate to
£8.82 per hour for all employees, and on April 1, 2021, we increased it further to £9.00 per hour,
in each case irrespective of age. These increases minimize the Group’s exposure to further
increases in the national living wage regulations.

**_Interest rate risk_**

The Group’s sensitivity to changes in interest rates is limited because part of our existing

financing arrangements, which will be repaid in full as part of the Transactions, have a fixed rate
of 10%. The Euro Notes will be subject to variable rates based on EURIBOR. The New Revolving
Credit Facility will be subject to variable rates based on EURIBOR, LIBOR and SONIA. We
monitor interest rates on a regular basis and react accordingly.

**_Foreign exchange risk_**

Foreign exchange risk arises when individual Group entities enter into transactions

denominated in a currency other than their functional currency. The Group’s policy is, where
possible, to allow Group entities to settle liabilities denominated in their functional currency with
the cash generated from their own operations in that currency. Where Group entities have liabilities
denominated in a currency other than their functional currency (and have insufficient reserves of
that currency to settle them), cash already denominated in that currency will, where possible, be
transferred from elsewhere within the Group.


-----

**_Capital risk_**

Capital risk arises from the management of the capital structure, which primarily consists

of the loans and borrowings detailed in Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for the
year ended December 31, 2020 as well as shareholder equity. Our capital structure is managed to
ensure that the Group can remain a going concern, and to maximize shareholder funds. Detailed
cash flow forecasts based on expected working capital requirements and expected capital projects
are maintained throughout the year to ensure that the Group has sufficient funds to operate as a
going concern using the available facilities.

**_Credit risk_**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument

fails to meet its contractual obligations. The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade
debtors. The credit risk of the Group is minimized due to the fact that a large number of customers
generally pay by direct debit in advance.

**Critical accounting estimates and judgments**

Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience

and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under
the circumstances. We make estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The estimates and
assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below.

**_Lease accounting_**

_Lease payments_

Our lease payments are discounted using the lessee's incremental borrowing rate, being the

rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset
of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms,
security and conditions. In order to determine the incremental borrowing rate, we consider three
main risk premiums adjustments: reference rate, credit risk premium and asset specific adjustment.

- Reference rate (risk free rate): in assessing the relevant reference rate, we factor in the
currency, economic environment and unexpired terms of the leases under review. Relevant
government bond yields have been used as a proxy for the risk-free rate.

- Credit risk premium: we use credit risk to reflect the difference in risk profile between a
government bond and another corporate debt security with the same maturity.

- Asset specific adjustment: we use property yields as a proxy to differentiate between different
property types and locations. Asset specific adjustments are based on property initial yield
benchmarks, taking into account the expected annual rental growth rate and the expected
annual building depreciation rate.


-----

The key factors influencing our discount rate are the economic environment, the length of

the lease, the lessee entity, the type of collateral used and the rent review mechanism used for the
relevant lease.

We have developed a categorization of leases and a matrix of discount rates to reflect these

specific factors. During the year ended December 31, 2020, a number of the Group’s leases were
re-negotiated and have been treated as lease modifications under IFRS 16. A revised discount rate
at the effective date of the modification has been used to re-measure the lease liabilities, with a
corresponding adjustment to the right-of use-asset. The incremental borrowing rate we calculated
as at December 31, 2020 ranges between 2.8% to 9.24% (compared to 2.8% to 9.0% as at
December 31, 2019) translating to an average rate of 7.1% (compared to 6.8% as at December 31,
2019). A 4-basis point fluctuation in the rate would cause the lease liabilities to increase or
decrease by £5.0 million and lead to a corresponding increase or decrease in the right-of-use assets
of £5.1 million. The incremental borrowing rate can change due to the type of leases that are held
by the Group, the economic environment, the lease terms and the underlying asset types.

_Lease terms_

In reviewing the terms of our leases, management considers all facts and circumstances

that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination
option. Periods covered by an option to extend are included in the lease term if the lessee is
reasonably certain to exercise such option, and the same rationale applies to termination options.

Significant judgement is required to determine the period over which a lease is considered

to be “enforceable.” When leases have an outstanding term greater than 10 years, we consider
there to be an unclear indication that the lease would in substance be deemed “enforceable” beyond
its original contractual term, despite the rights provided by the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954. In
these situations, we use the lease end date as the reference end date. For leases with an outstanding
term of 10 years or less, the likelihood of extension is assessed up to the year end with reference
to the facts available and looking at the Group’s history of renewing leases beyond their contractual
end date.

For the current leases held by the Group, we have estimated the minimum lease term to be

the term of each relevant lease contract, including revisionary leases in connection with the
COVID-19 pandemic. Each lease is assessed on an individual basis, having regards to our current
plans and expectations, and we decide whether to extend or terminate accordingly.

**_Key assumptions used for assessing goodwill for impairment_**

The Group assesses impairments to goodwill on an annual basis. Goodwill arising in

connection with our acquisition by TDR Capital on November 1, 2013 was tested at the Group
level. Goodwill is generally monitored at the group level because it is considered to be the smallest
relevant cash-generating units for goodwill impairment testing. Goodwill is also recognized in
relation to the acquisition of individual clubs, for which we consider the acquired club as the
relevant cash-generating unit. When testing goodwill for impairment, the Group determines the
recoverable amount by estimating the value in use of the cash-generating units within the Group.
The calculation of value in use requires estimation of future cash flows and a discount rate to


-----

determine the present value. The sensitivity to changes in this assumption are disclosed in note 15
to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020.

**_Key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations_**

The Group tests the carrying amounts of individual club non-current assets for impairment

for clubs that meet pre-defined impairment indicators. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and
2020, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units was determined based on value-in-use
calculations which require the use of assumptions. The calculations use cash flow projections
based on financial budgets and business plans covering a three-year period approved by
management. Cash flows beyond the three-year period are extrapolated using an estimated growth
rate of 1.8% for the U.K. and Dutch clubs, 1.7% for Spanish clubs and 1.4% for French and Belgian
clubs. These growth rates are consistent with industry- and country-specific forecasts in which
each relevant cash-generating unit operates. The pre-tax discount rates of 10.5% in the U.K. and
11.5% in Spain have been determined based on the weighted average cost of capital. The
sensitivity to changes in assumptions used for value-in-use calculations are disclosed in note 15 to
our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020.

**_Judgements in determining the timing of satisfaction of performance obligations under_**

**_IFRS15_**

The timing of satisfaction of performance obligations in respect of administration and

joining fees for members requires judgment. Administration and joining fees represent a fee for
the initial set-up costs of the contract and for the right to renew the membership for no additional
fee when such contract expires. The set-up costs are critical to the contract with the new member,
but they do not satisfy performance obligations, as no good or service is transferred to the member.
The member effectively pays for the future right of renewing their membership for no additional
fee. Because it is only when renewal occurs that the performance obligation is fulfilled, revenue is
released over the full duration of membership, which includes any renewal period. In order to
determine the average duration of a membership and the relevant number of renewals for each
package type, the group considers historical data and trends, as well as the detailed criteria for the
recognition of revenue set out in IFRS 15. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the closure of the
majority of our clubs during the First Lockdown and the Second Lockdown, as a result of which
no revenue was recognized during this period because no performance obligations were satisfied.
Following the detailed review of our membership base and historic trends, we are satisfied that the
recognition of revenue in accordance with the above method for the current year is appropriate.

**_Control and option valuation_**

On January 30, 2020, DLL Greenwich GmbH purchased the entire issued share capital of

the Meridian Group. On the same date, Deuce TopCo Limited and DLL Greenwich GmbH entered
into an agreement with David Lloyd Leisure Limited pursuant to which David Lloyd Leisure
Limited agreed to provide certain management and operational services and to license its trade
marks to the Meridian Group. In consideration for these services, Deuce Topco Limited granted
David Lloyd Leisure Limited an option to acquire the entire issued share capital of DLL Greenwich
Limited. The option is exercisable at any point from January 30, 2020 to January 30, 2023. In order
to exercise the option, DLL Greenwich Limited would need to obtain consent from its banking


-----

group. Given this requirement and the economic and legal barriers in place, we have concluded
that the Group does not have control over DLL Greenwich Limited until the option is exercised
and have therefore not consolidated DLL Greenwich Limited into our financial results as at
December 31, 2020.

The fair value of the option is derived using option valuation techniques, with key inputs

for the market value of DLL Greenwich Limited, the cost to exercise the option and other key
factors such as market volatility. The key driver of the valuation is the equity value of DLL
Greenwich Limited, which requires significant management judgement due to the fact that this
entity is not publicly listed. Using the purchase price of the Meridian Group and the year-end
enterprise value of the business, we have concluded the value of the option to be £nil.

**Industry**

_The information in the following section has been provided for background purposes. The_

_information has been extracted from a variety of sources released by public and private_
_organizations. The industry information has been accurately reproduced and, as far as we are_
_aware and are able to ascertain from information published by such sources, no facts have been_
_omitted which would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading._

_Throughout 2020 and 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented_

_disruption to our industry, with mandatory club closures imposed in the U.K. and most European_
_countries during the First Lockdown and the Second Lockdown. For this reason, the information_
_presented below voluntarily omits data representative of the health and fitness industry after the_
_year ended December 31, 2019. We believe that the industry information as of and for the year_
_ended December 31, 2019 more accurately represent the health and fitness industry in a steady_
_state of business than the data for the year ended December 31, 2020. Any forward-looking_
_statements contained in the industry and market data presented below were made prior to the_
_outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (except where stated otherwise) and have not been updated_
_to account for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. There can be no assurance that such_
_forward-looking statements would not have been materially different had the COVID-19 pandemic_
_been taken into account. See “Forward-looking statements”._

We operate in the premium segment of the health and fitness club market in the U.K. and

Europe, which is large and presents significant growth opportunities. We believe this market is
structurally attractive, particularly as the world emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic.

**_Overview of the U.K. health and fitness club market_**

The U.K. health and fitness club market was growing before the COVID-19 pandemic. The

total value of the U.K. health and fitness club market increased from £4.3 billion as of December
2015 to £5.1 billion as of December 2019, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”)
of 4.4% (Source: LDC Report). Over this same period, the number of health and fitness clubs in the
U.K. grew from 6,312 to 7,239, reflecting a CAGR of 3.5%, while the number of health and fitness
club members grew from 8.8 million to 10.4 million, reflecting a CAGR of 4.3% (Source: LDC
_Report). As of December 2019, 16% of the U.K. population, or approximately one in six people,_
were a member of a health and fitness club (Source: LDC Report) and 11%, or approximately one
in ten people, were a member of a private health and fitness club (Source: LDC Report).

_Source: LDC Report._ _Source: LDC Report._

The 4.3% CAGR in U.K. health and fitness club members from December 2015 to

December 2019 may be primarily attributed to U.K. consumers increasing their focus on health
and wellbeing and expenses related thereto being increasingly perceived as essential rather than
discretionary expenditure (Source: LDC Report). This increased focus on wellbeing is driven by
consumers’ growing awareness of the significant benefits of a healthy lifestyle and stimulates
growth in penetration rates. Modest population growth, increases in consumers’ disposable
incomes and innovation and new technology in fitness have also contributed to the growth of the
U.K. health and fitness club market over the past five years.


-----

The U.K. health and fitness club market is split into two main segments: public clubs and

private clubs. The private clubs segment can be further split into: (i) premium clubs, which is the
segment in which we operate, (ii) mid-market clubs and (iii) low-cost clubs.

The growth of the U.K. health and fitness club market over the past five years has largely

occurred in the low-cost segment and at the expense of the mid-market, with operators in this
segment exiting the market or downsizing their portfolios, as illustrated by the acquisition of LA
Fitness by Pure Gym in 2015. We believe this is a positive trend for us over the long-term as some
of the low-cost members will likely upgrade to the premium segment of the market over time.

**_Private clubs_**

Private clubs are funded and operated by commercial enterprises. The private club market

is significantly larger than the public club market, with approximately 4,510 clubs and 7.0 million
members (Source: LDC Report), equivalent to an average of approximately 1,554 members per
club as of December 2019. On average, private clubs charged monthly membership fees of £41 as
of December 2019 (Source: LDC Report). The number of private clubs increased from 3,550 as of
December 2015 to 4,510 as of December 2019, reflecting a CAGR of 6.2% (Source: LDC Report).
Over this same period, the number of private club members grew from 5.5 million to 7.0 million,
reflecting a CAGR of 6.5%, while private club revenue has increased from £3.0 billion to £3.7
billion, reflecting a CAGR of 5.6% (Source: LDC Report). The private club market is fragmented,
and the ten largest private club operators only accounted for approximately 25% of the private club
market (by number of gyms) as of December 2019 (Source: LDC Report).

**_Composition of the private health and fitness club market_**

The private club market is split into three primary segments: (i) premium clubs, (ii) mid
market clubs, and (iii) low-cost clubs. We operate in the premium segment, where we are the
largest operator by revenue by a significant margin as compared to the second largest operator in
this market segment, Virgin Active.

Premium clubs are generally larger in size than mid-market and low-cost clubs and usually

contain a wider range of facilities including, for example, wet areas (e.g. swimming pools, spas and
saunas), racquet sports courts (e.g. tennis, squash and padel courts) and social areas for members
(e.g. bars and cafés), in addition to best-in-class gym equipment and exercise classes. Members of
premium clubs are often required to sign up to fixed-duration membership contracts, which
typically include early termination fees.

Premium clubs generally have higher operating costs than mid-market and low-cost clubs

due to their larger size, higher breadth and number of facilities offered and better quality of
equipment, greater number of staff (e.g. onsite sales and marketing teams and fully staffed
reception and refreshment areas) and higher maintenance costs (e.g. cleaning and maintenance of
wet areas and trained instructors across a wide range of facilities). The quality of the clubs is
generally higher than mid-market and low-cost clubs and offers a wider offering, which commands
a correspondingly higher membership fee. Premium clubs generally have a stickier membership
base and lower attrition rates when compared to mid-market and low cost clubs, which is
demonstrated by our pre-pandemic attrition rate of 32.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019,
compared to up to approximately 100% reported by certain low cost operators pre-pandemic
(Source: public information).

Mid-market clubs constitute a middle ground between the premium and low-cost segments.

Their offering includes stationary and cardio equipment, as well as additional facilities that lowcost clubs do not offer such as a pool and spa and membership fees in between those of the lowcost and premium clubs. In the last several years, there has been an increasing bifurcation in the
health and fitness market, with a rise in the number of premium and low-cost clubs and a decrease
in the number of mid-market clubs, as large mid-market players such as L.A. Fitness exited the
market in 2015.

Low-cost clubs sit at the other end of the spectrum. They typically charge lower monthly

membership fees, do not require their members to enter into fixed duration contracts, provide a
smaller range of facilities (typically restricted to gym equipment) and have longer opening hours.

**Public clubs**

Public clubs are funded and operated by local authorities or county councils. They typically

offer a wide variety of facilities such as sports halls, exercise studios and swimming pools. Some
public clubs are managed or operated by private companies on behalf of local authorities and
county councils. Public clubs are generally open to members of the public on a pay-and-play or
membership basis. As of December 2019, there were 2,729 public clubs with a total of 3.4 million
members in the U.K., equivalent to an average of 1,237 members per club (Source: LDC Report).
On average, public clubs charged monthly membership fees of £30.1 as of December 2019
(Source: LDC Report). The number of public clubs decreased marginally between December 2015
to December 2019 from 2,762 to 2,729, while the number of public club members increased from
3.3 million to 3.4 million, reflecting a CAGR of 0.3% (Source: LDC Report). The revenue
generated by the public club market increased from £1.3 billion to £1.4 billion during the same
period, reflecting a CAGR of 1.5% (Source: LDC Report). The three largest public club operators
in the U.K. (by number of clubs) are Greenwich Leisure Limited, Sports and Leisure Management
Ltd. (trading as Everyone Active) and Places for People Leisure (Source: LDC Report). We believe
that while public clubs compete broadly with the mid-market and low-cost segments, they do not
effectively compete with the premium club segment because their offering lacks ancillary services
comparable to ours as well as trained instructors and digital solutions.

**Overview of the European health and fitness market (including continental Europe and the**
**U.K.)**

The European health and fitness club market was growing before the COVID-19 pandemic.

The total value of the European health and fitness club market increased from €24.6 billion as of
December 2015 to €26.2 billion as of December 2019, reflecting a CAGR of 1.6% (Source:
_Statista). Over the same period, the number of health and fitness clubs in Europe grew from 51,204_
to 63,644, reflecting a CAGR of 5.6%, while the number of members also grew from 52.4 million
to 64.8 million, reflecting a CAGR of 5.3% (Source: Statista).

The European health and fitness market is heavily fragmented and displays considerable

differences between individual countries. Medium-sized countries such as Sweden (22.0%
penetration rate), Norway (22.0% penetration rate) and the Netherlands (17.4% penetration rate)
have high membership figures relative to their respective populations, which is due to their high
proportion of physically active people, relatively high urbanization rates and high levels of
household income and the presence of large fitness operators in these countries (Source: European
_Health & Fitness Market, Deloitte). At the same time, markets with lower penetration rates such_
as Poland (8%) also display some market potential, with membership growth of 2% in 2019
(Source: European Health & Fitness Market, Deloitte).

**Outlook and impact of Covid-19**

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments in the U.K. and in all European

countries in which we operate have implemented strict social distancing measures with varying
degrees of lockdowns and closures of non-essential businesses, including leisure facilities such as
ours. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented disruption to the health and fitness
industry, and the wide variations in potential outcomes present a material challenge to our business
and our industry. Due to the closure of clubs, many operators have frozen memberships in order to
retain members and have therefore generated no to very little revenue throughout the lockdown
periods. As a consequence, health and fitness club operators have had to shift attention and resources
to managing their operating expenses and cash balances in order to maintain sufficient liquidity


-----

during the First Lockdown and the Second Lockdown. Operators that have not managed to retain
sufficient capital have experienced significant financial distress or filed for bankruptcy.

Many governments have offered support packages for businesses and employees that are

unable to operate due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As one of the hardest hit, the health and fitness
industry has generally benefitted from extensive government support, including job-retention
schemes, tax deferrals, business rates holidays, loan schemes and other measures. In addition,
many operators have renegotiated their lease agreements or obtained rent reductions and rent
deferrals from their landlords to share the burden of non-operating health and fitness club facilities.
For more information about the risks associated with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and
our ability to minimize cash burn through government aid, see “Risk factors—Risks relating to our
_business and industry—The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and will continue to_
_adversely impact, our business, financial position and results of operations.”_

Recent vaccine approvals have raised hopes of a turnaround in the pandemic and economic

recovery in 2021 in the U.K. and across Europe, and the health and fitness industry is now focused
on reopening and bouncing back. While the COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on
the industry, we believe it will bounce back strongly, as evidenced by the reopening of clubs after
the First Lockdown in 2020. Following the staggered re-opening of facilities at the end of the Second
Lockdown in April 2021, we have seen better than expected attendance, membership sales and enquiries,
thereby providing us with confidence for the year ahead.

We believe the COVID-19 pandemic is shaping trends that will benefit our industry over

the medium-term and reinforcing the importance of a healthy lifestyle. We believe that there will
be a shift to experimental spend by our target demographics, with 35% of people in the U.K. with
no prior gym membership surveyed during April 2020 reporting that they would consider buying
a membership following the uplifting of COVID-19 restrictions, according to research conducted
by UKactive.

In addition, structural changes such as working from home are likely to benefit certain segments

of the industry. According to Barclays’ research, post-pandemic, white collar employees expect
working from home days to increase by 60% (to 1.6 days per week on average), while employers
expect working from home days to double (to 2.0 days per week on average) (Source: Barclays
_Research Work from Home: A Global Revolution Special Report). Working from home may_
provide health and fitness club members with more flexibility in their schedule to attend a club, a
trend which is likely to further reinforce our competitive offering.

**_Recessionary resilience_**

The health and fitness club industry has been historically resilient to recessions and is less

likely to be impacted significantly when compared with other industries, as evidenced during the
last global recession from 2007 to 2009 when the overall U.K. market did not contract (Source:
_LDC Report). In fact, between 2007 and 2010, the U.K. health and fitness market grew by a CAGR_
of 2.2% (Source: LDC Report).

_Source: LDC Report._

One factor that drives this resilience is that spend on health and fitness is typically recession

resistant. While more discretionary and less habitual spends such as electrical goods, clothing and
footwear are typically the first to be cut, contrastingly, health and fitness memberships are cited as
one of the last spends to be affected during a recession, which is illustrated by the survey results
below.

Premium clubs may be even more resilient to recessions because of the demographics of

their membership base, which typically include more affluent members living in suburban areas,
due to their higher average membership costs. Affluent target demographics have a larger income
buffer, which serves to protect their discretionary spend during a recession. Furthermore, higher
earners have historically recovered faster from a recession as compared to other tranches of the
population with a lower level of disposable income.

**Business**

**Overview**

We are the leading premium lifestyle club operator in Europe based on revenue for the year

ended December 31, 2019. On a pro forma run-rate adjusted basis, pre-COVID-19 pandemic, we
had approximately 668 thousand members as of December 31, 2019. As of March 31, 2021 we
operated 99 clubs in the U.K., one club in the Republic of Ireland and 22 clubs in continental
Europe. Our mission is to provide high-quality destinations suitable for the whole family and all
age ranges with an emphasis on the quality of our offering and expert delivery of multiple products
and services, creating a sense of belonging and improving our members’ lives. Our clubs are places
for me-time, together-time, work, rest and play-time under one roof, improving the lives of our
members and providing a home away from home under our “My Club for My Life” ethos.

We differentiate ourselves from our competitors by blending our distinguished social

offerings with our market-leading sports and leisure facilities and fitness offerings, allowing us to
cultivate a loyal and “sticky” membership base. Our club rooms and outdoor spaces encourage
member interaction and provide a social, destination environment where members can relax and
socialize in a vibrant setting. The breadth and quality of our offering allows us to attract and retain
members of all ages, including families and older demographics, whom we believe are more likely
to become long-term members because our clubs become an integral part of their lives. We believe
our distinctive family focus, with programs and services catered to the whole family, enhances
member engagement, promotes membership retention and differentiates us from our competitors.
We believe that we have maintained markedly lower attrition rates than our peers, with a prepandemic attrition rate of 32.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to up to
approximately 100% reported by certain low cost operators pre-pandemic (Source: public
_information), and the average membership tenure for our long-term members (i.e. those who had_
their membership for over 18 months) was seven years and our long-term members represented
63% of our member base, in each case, as of February 29, 2020 (excluding our Meridian clubs).
Based on the aggregate monthly membership fees paid by our long-term members for the month
February 2020, our aggregate implied recurring revenue over the seven year tenure would have
been approximately £1.9 billion. Our total membership subscription revenue, including joining
fees and administration fees, represented 78.2% of our total revenue for the year ended December
31, 2019. Our retail revenue generated by services such as our food and beverage offering,
childcare services and wellness products and our other revenue generated primarily by personal
training sessions and swimming and tennis tuition produce significant ancillary revenue and
represented 10.2% and 11.6%, respectively, of our total revenue in the year ended December 31,
2019.

Our business model focuses on operating a portfolio of strategically located clubs in

suburban areas, with each site situated in close proximity to an affluent demographic population.
Our clubs are well-invested and include heated indoor and outdoor pools, top-class racquet
facilities, well-equipped group exercise studios, state-of-the-art gyms, luxurious spas, crèches,
family-oriented club rooms and outdoor spaces, lounges with restaurants and bars as well as a fully
complementary digital offering, thereby delivering an outstanding customer experience to our
members. In addition, the range and breadth of services offered by our clubs results in longer


-----

customer dwell-time, increased secondary spending, higher market penetration and improved
retention rates compared to our competitors.

While we operate mainly in the U.K., with 99 of our clubs located in the U.K. as of March

31, 2021, we see significant growth potential in Europe. Our recent acquisition of the eight
Meridian Group clubs in Germany has increased our penetration significantly into one of the most
important European markets. We expect to continue to consider additional international sites
through selective, value-enhancing strategic acquisitions of small portfolios as well as standalone
sites in Europe, in line with our overall growth plan. We believe that there are currently no
European competitors of significant scale in the premium health and fitness market segment, which
presents us an opportunity to capture additional market share through organic growth and
opportunistic acquisitions. The map below illustrates the location of our clubs:

For the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated £519.5 million of revenue, a loss of

£51.5 million and £577.4 million of Pro Forma Run Rate Revenue with a Pro Forma Run Rate
Adjusted EBITDA of £170.9 million and Cash Conversion Ratio of 72.9%. We increased _Pro_
_Forma Run Rate Revenue, Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA and actual operating cash at_
a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 14.8%, 28.0% and 27.2%, respectively, from the
financial year ended January 3, 2016 to December 31, 2019.

**Our strengths**

**_Leading player in structurally attractive and growing U.K. and European health and fitness_**
**_club market with further growth expected post the COVID-19 pandemic_**

We are the leading premium lifestyle club operator in Europe based on revenue for the year

ended December 31, 2019, with 99 clubs in the U.K., one club in the RoI and 22 clubs in
continental Europe. The U.K. and European health and fitness club market in which we operate is
large and growing. We believe that this market is structurally attractive, particularly as the world
emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic. The total value of the U.K. health and fitness club market
increased from £4.3 billion as of December 2015 to £5.1 billion as of December 2019, reflecting
a CAGR of 4.4% (Source: LDC Report). Over this same period, the number of U.K. health and


-----

fitness clubs grew from 6,312 to 7,239, reflecting a CAGR of 3.5%, while the number of health
and fitness club members grew from 8.8 million to 10.4 million, reflecting a CAGR of 4.3%
(Source: LDC Report). As of December 2019, 16% of the U.K. population, or approximately one
in six people, were a member of a health and fitness club (Source: LDC Report) and 11%, or
approximately one in ten people, were a member of a private health and fitness club. The total
value of the European health and fitness club market increased from €24.6 billion as of December
2015 to €26.2 billion as of December 2019, reflecting a CAGR of 1.6% (Source: Statista). Over
this same period, the number of health and fitness clubs in Europe grew from 51,204 to 63,644,
reflecting a CAGR of 5.6%.

We believe that growth in the U.K. and European health and fitness club market, including

a growth in penetration rates, is largely attributable to the increasing focus of consumers on health
and wellbeing and a growing awareness of the significant benefits of a healthy lifestyle. These
same consumers also increasingly view health and fitness as an essential rather than discretionary
expenditure. Modest population growth, increases in consumers’ disposable incomes and
innovation and new technology in fitness may also have driven growth of the U.K. and European
health and fitness club markets over the past five years. We anticipate that demand for health and
fitness clubs will accelerate post-pandemic as the COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the benefits
of a healthy lifestyle.

We believe the COVID-19 pandemic is shaping trends that will benefit our industry over

the mid-term. With more people working from home, our members have greater flexibility to
spend more time at our clubs, which are predominantly located in suburban areas. According to
Barclays’ research, post-pandemic, white collar employees in the U.K. expect working from home
days to increase by 60% (to 1.6 days per week on average), while employers in the U.K. expect
working from home days to double (to 2.0 days per week on average) (Source: Barclays Research
_Work from Home: A Global Revolution Special Report). We believe that this trend is further_
supported by a long-term shift to experiential spend by our target demographics, with 35% of
people in the U.K. with no prior gym membership surveyed during April 2020 reporting that they
would consider buying a membership following the uplifting of COVID-19 restrictions, according
to research conducted by UKactive.

Our expectations for growth in the U.K. and European health and fitness club market post
pandemic present an opportunity for our business. As a result of market growth and recent healthfocused trends, we anticipate more members being able to join and spend time at our clubs.

**_A broad and highly differentiated offering that makes us more than just a gym which is_**
**_unmatched by any scale competitor_**

We offer our members a distinguished selection of facilities and services which we believe

are unrivalled in breadth and quality. In particular, we differentiate ourselves from our competitors
by blending our social and wellness offerings with our market-leading sports and fitness facilities,
thus cultivating a loyal and “sticky” membership base.


-----

_Our social offering_

Our “clubiness” is a key to driving our social offering. We want our members to feel they

belong to their club rather than visiting solely for exercise and our vibrant club rooms and social
outdoor spaces are a key component of our offering which provide members with a destination
environment where they can relax and interact with each other. We pride ourselves upon our local,
and often member self-started, societies among our clubs, which build loyal communities centered
around common interests and create a distinctive “clubs with clubs” culture. We also organize
various bespoke social events to drive member engagement and retention, all of which are tailored
to meet the specific needs of our members. In addition, several of our training options, such as
tennis leagues and running and triathlon clubs, feature a strong social element to encourage
participation via group coaching and friendly competitions. Most of our clubs have lounges with
a restaurant service and licensed bar, which represents our largest source of ancillary revenue
(47.5% of ancillary revenue (including retail and other revenue) in the year ended December 31,
2019). Many of our outdoor pool areas also have a barbecue or other food and beverage service,
thereby creating a destination area in the summer months. We regularly update our menus in
response to member feedback to maximize the appeal of our food and beverage offering and stay
in touch with our customers’ preferences.

Our clubs are open to all ages and have a distinctive family focus, with families and couples

representing approximately two thirds of our membership base as of March 31, 2021, leading our
clubs to become an integral part of the families’ lives. We believe that this offering enhances
member engagement, promotes membership retention and differentiates us from our competitors.
We believe, based on management estimates, that we are one of the largest U.K. child activity
providers, as we offer extensive facilities for children (who represented approximately a quarter
of our members as of March 31, 2021). These include daycare, crèches, structured activity
programs, kids play-frames, child-friendly tablets, dedicated splash pools and family friendly areas
such as soft play and DL Kids activity areas, family lounges and family changing rooms, with an
average of approximately 500 family classes every week and 38,500 kids enrolled in the swimming
and tennis lessons of our All Stars programs for children aged 3–11 during the year ended
December 31, 2019.

More recently, we have further expanded our social offering by introducing quiet spaces

within our clubs to allow members to work directly from our premises. Our dedicated adult-only
business lounges have been designed so that members are given sufficient flexibility to take
advantage of our facilities while tending to their professional duties, in line with the recent
working-from-home trend spurred on as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As an increasing
number of our members are choosing or needing to work from home, we seek to facilitate the
transition to a comfortable and reliable remote working environment by offering on-site spaces to
work from, thereby further strengthening our “clubiness.” As of March 31, 2021, all of our clubs
offered large and spacious lounges with complimentary WiFi access. In addition, we offer
dedicated adult-only lounges and business hubs in a select number of clubs.

_Our sports, fitness and wellness offering_

We believe we are one of the market leaders in privately-owned sports facilities in the U.K.

Our racquets, swimming and sports facilities are some of the highest quality in the market and are


-----

accompanied by leading professional coaches. As of March 31, 2021, we operated 117 squash
courts and, based on management estimates, we operated approximately 36% of all indoor tennis
courts in the U.K. Further, as of March 31, 2021, we operated 196 indoor and outdoor pools across
the U.K. Our innovative group exercise programs, extensive studio facilities and state-of-the-art
gyms complement the full suite of our offering, helping us meet the varied needs of our members.
We believe group exercise is a significant driver of member retention, and have capitalized on this
trend by offering weekly 18,800 adult classes across all our clubs in the year ended December 31,
2019. We also offer extensive high-quality gym facilities, with an average of 120 pieces of gym
equipment per club as of March 31, 2021.

Our holistic approach to health includes what we believe to be market-leading wellness

offerings, which includes relaxing spa facilities, dedicated mind and body studios and a healthy
and nutritious menu. As of March 31, 2021, approximately 99% of our clubs included saunas,
steam rooms and jacuzzies. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we hosted approximately
2,500 mind and body classes every week. A select number of our U.K. clubs now include Spa
Retreats, which provides members with a high-end, luxurious wellness experience.

Lastly, we are cognizant of the preference of some of our members to exercise from home,

and have bolstered our digital offering in order to keep our members engaged and connected during
the First Lockdown and the Second Lockdown. Our @home app is the flagship of our digital
offering and offers our members a weekly timetable of fitness classes and interactive events and
an extensive library of on-demand classes and tailored workout plans, all of which are designed
by our professional staff. The @home app also benefits from the integrated services of ancillary
service providers such as Boditrax and Myzone, which further reinforce our digital ecosystem. As
of March 31, 2021, our @home app had over 1,500 pieces of content, which were viewed 8.2
million times and used by approximately half of our members during the First Lockdown and the
Second Lockdown.

_No scale competitors with comparable offerings_

We offer a wide breadth of services and facilities that traditional gym groups and country

clubs do not match on a comparable scale, which reinforces our competitive advantage. Our
comprehensive club offering includes gyms, exercise and spinning studios, group exercise classes,
indoor and outdoor pools, saunas, steam rooms, jacuzzies, crèches, tennis courts with a range of
surface types, treatment rooms and squash courts. By contrast, most private clubs are only able to
provide a subset of our offering. For example, as of March 31, 2021, while 100% of our clubs had
dance studios, group exercise classes and indoor pools, private clubs that include those services
only amounted to 60%, 52% and 35%, respectively (according to management estimates). As of
March 31, 2021, approximately 99% of our clubs included saunas, steam rooms and jacuzzies,
while only 48%, 38% and 30% of private clubs included those same facilities, respectively
(according to management estimates). Moreover, while as of March 31, 2021, 90% of our clubs
included a crèche, 83% included a tennis offering and 73% included an outdoor pool, only 8%,
3% and 4% of private clubs featured those same services (according to management estimates).

We believe that our varied offering, including our outdoor facilities, tennis courts,

swimming pools, spas, restaurants, crèches and both live and on-demand workouts with our
@home app, allows us to stand out competitively within the premium segment of the market, and


-----

that there are no scale competitors with a comparable offerings. The breadth of our offering as
compared with other private club operators is illustrated by the following chart:

_(Source: Management estimates)_

**_Our scale and well-invested and strategically located club offering is difficult to replicate_**

_Catchment areas_

We believe that new entrants to the premium segment of the health and fitness club market

would experience difficulties in attempting to disrupt our strong presence and member base, both
in the U.K. and Europe. This is because significant capital, time, know-how and available land are
required to locate and develop a site that can be operated profitably. An attractive catchment area
is crucial for our clubs to be successful. As of March 31, 2021, according to management estimates,
there were only 39 target catchments in the U.K. that we had identified as suitable for the
development of a profitable club where we do not yet have a presence. The below charts illustrate
our current incumbency in the U.K. and the limited number of attractive target catchments where
we are not present:

David Lloyd’s incumbency Available sites


-----

Developing a profitable club requires finding a sufficiently affluent catchment area.

Against this background, we have a well-invested portfolio of premium locations throughout the
majority of affluent catchment areas in the U.K, which we believe are located in prime locations
and easily accessible by most of the population. As of March 31, 2021, based on management
estimates, 91% of our current members lived within a 20 minute drive of our clubs.

In addition, the significant capital requirements, time and know-how required to develop a

site, once located, present a significant investment cost to any new entrant. Our sites, from the
purchase of land to the fit-out of the club, cost approximately £13 million on average to develop.
To achieve a scale comparable to that of David Lloyd, we estimate that a potential new entrant
would need to invest over £1.5 billion over a significant period of time and with high execution
risk, while also having to source considerable know-how and devote a significant amount of time
to each site development project. We estimate that the full process from the initial scope (including
planning permission, detailed design, construction and fit out) to the opening of a site (including
membership ramp-up to the maturity of the site) would take a competitor six to seven years to
complete for each new club.

_Geographic diversification_

While our operations are primarily concentrated in the U.K., we also cover some of the

most affluent areas in some of Europe’s most important markets. Our European clubs in Italy,
Spain, Belgium and Germany are placed and marketed strategically to achieve affluent catchment
in some of Europe’s most affluent markets by Affluence Mix, as illustrated by the below chart:

We have substantially increased our market share in key European markets and we

currently have a presence in countries that represent more than 72% of the entire European market
(Source: Statista, 2020). We also have plans for further selective expansion via value-enhancing
strategic acquisitions. For example, our recent acquisition of eight clubs in Germany has increased
our penetration significantly into one of the most important European markets.

**_Loyal, affluent and diversified member base delivers resilient and recurring revenues_**

_Loyal_

We believe that our loyal customer base drives our recurring revenues. The average

membership tenure for our long-term members (i.e. those who had their membership over 18
months) was seven years and our long-term members represented 63% of our member base, in
each case, as of February 29, 2020 (excluding our Meridian clubs). Based on the aggregate monthly
membership fees paid by our long-term members for the month February 2020, our aggregate
implied recurring revenue over the seven year tenure would have been approximately £1.9 billion.
We believe we have one of the lowest attrition rates in the industry with a pre-pandemic attrition
rate of 32.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to up to approximately 100%
reported by certain low cost operators pre-pandemic (Source: public information). We believe that
our low attrition rates and the fact that a vast majority of our members join us with a 12-month
contract with a three-month notice period (providing us visibility and an opportunity to engage
with and convince leaving members before their contract ends) make us resilient to adverse market
conditions. Our high levels of retention drive a resilient and recurring revenue base with robust
levels of growth. The chart below shows the evolution of our total attrition relative to our total
number of new members between 2015 and 2019:

Our like-for-like membership growth has also been unaffected by annual price increases in

the last five years, which we believe is a testament to our member loyalty and our track-record of
understanding our members, innovating our offering in line with our members’ needs, providing
excellent service and successful reinvestments into our estate to improve the quality and offerings
of our clubs. Our members pay premium value for premium quality.


-----

Like-for-like membership growth

_Affluent_

Our membership base is generally affluent and diverse, which we believe makes it less

prone to economic downturns and recessions. In fact, as at November 2019, 58% of our members
had a household income of £60,000 or more as compared to only 18% of the U.K. population. The
below chart demonstrates that the Affluence Mix across our U.K. clubs is over indexed compared
to the national average, based on management estimates:

_Diversified_

We pride ourselves on the diversity of our membership base. As of March 31, 2021,

approximately two thirds of our membership was made up of families and couples. We also benefit
from diverse age demographics, with 50% of our members aged between 18 and 50, 24% under
the age of 18 and 26% over the age of 50 as of March 31, 2021. The breadth and quality of our
offering allows us to attract and retain members of all ages, including families and older
demographics, whom we believe are more likely to become long-term members because our clubs
become an integral part of their lives. As of March 31, 2021, children and individuals aged at least
50 comprised half of our membership base, as illustrated by the chart below:


-----

**_Consistent delivery of growth and strong cashflow generation_**

Our rapid topline growth, underpinned by new member sales and price increases and

combined with a disciplined approach towards cost control, allows us to drive substantial cash
generation. We were operating at all-time highs in revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and operating cash
flow prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, with strong underlying performance driven by multiple
levers. In particular, our membership subscriptions revenue grew at a CAGR of 12.4% between
the financial year ended January 3, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2019.

Between the financial year ended January 3, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2019,

our total revenue increased from £330 million to £520 million (£413 million on a like-for-like
basis), representing a 12.0% increase in CAGR (5.8% on a like-for-like basis), our EBITDA
increased from £65 million to £135 (£108 million on a like-for-like basis), representing a 19.9%
increase in CAGR (13.3% on a like-for-like basis) and our operating cash increased from £38
million to £99 million, representing a 27.3% increase in CAGR, in each case as illustrated by the
charts below:

Our impressive earnings growth and margin expansion prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,

which we believe will resume following the staggered reopening of our facilities at the end of the
Second Lockdown, is supported by a well-controlled cost base. We have also implemented new
cost saving initiatives. Our Fit For Growth Program implemented in December 2020 is expected
to yield approximately £10 million of annual labor cost savings from 2021 onwards compared to
our labor costs for the year ended December 31, 2019, following a full review of club structures,
duty manager shifts and benchmarking of departmental hours as well as an increased focus on
digital solutions to optimize our staff and overhead costs. However, while management’s


-----

disciplined approach towards cost control has made our substantial revenue growth visible at
Adjusted EBITDA level, with our staff costs, overheads, club support and rent costs growing at a
CAGR substantively below our revenue CAGR between the financial year ended January 3, 2016
and the year ended December 31, 2019, our primary focus remains on delivering a best in-class
service and outstanding customer experience for our members. Therefore, while cost discipline
remains important, it does not take precedence over delivering a high-quality experience for our
members.

**_Industry leading management team_**

Our management team has a deep wealth of experience and talent. Their track-record of proven
success places us in a position to expand upon our robust market position. Our Executive
Chairman, Glenn Earlam, joined us from Merlin Entertainments (formerly Tussauds), where he
was Managing Director of Midway Attractions. Mr. Earlam was responsible for a successful
cultural change at Tussauds and led the global rollout of Midway Attractions. Under Mr. Earlam’s
leadership, we have been focusing on a number of operational initiatives aimed at improving our
customer service delivery, lowering customer attrition and bolstering brand awareness. While at
Merlin Entertainments, Mr. Earlam worked with our Chief Executive Officer, Russel Barnes for
over 20 years. Mr. Barnes brings considerable transformation and rollout experience to the team.
Another key member of our team, Patrick Burrows joined us as Chief Financial Officer from
London City Airport where he oversaw the £2.4 billion sale of the business. Prior to London City
Airport, Mr. Burrows worked at New Look and Tesco. The current management team expanded
our footprint through strategic value-enhancing acquisitions and organic growth, including the
acquisition of 14 Virgin Active clubs in 2017 and the acquisition of eight Meridian clubs in
Germany, growing our number of clubs from 94 clubs in 2016 to 122 in 2021. Our team is rounded
out by a dedicated group of directors with over 60 years of tenure between them.

**Our strategy**

The core of our strategy is to continue to deliver sustainable, profitable growth by focusing

on creating a premium experience for our club members. With our well-invested estate and wide
product offering, we put our members at the heart of our proposition, enabling us to deliver yield
and growth. Through reinvesting our profits into our existing estate to deliver an ever-improving
member experience, we create a virtuous circle that is proven and sustainable, as illustrated by the
chart below:


-----

**_Listening to members_**

We want our members to feel like David Lloyd is their club. We have a sophisticated,

comprehensive and targeted member communications program in place, covering the duration of
a member’s lifetime with us to encourage a high level of engagement and to allow us to understand
the desires of our members. We emphasize the quality of our offering and expert delivery of
multiple products and services, and we focus on member engagement and a tailored
communication strategy in order to stay in touch with our members frequently and effectively. We
ask our members for feedback on a regular basis, with an average of approximately 15 thousand
pieces of feedback received weekly through feedback stations in our clubs and push notifications
received through our @home app after each member visit. In addition, we track our members’ club
visits and directly reach out to them when we notice a drop in attendance, which allows us to assess
each member’s particular needs, offer bespoke programs, demonstrate our strong commitment to
member satisfaction and altogether rekindle engagement. We believe that this model allows us to
closely stay in touch with our members’ needs and foster a unique sense of belonging within our
clubs.

**_Improving our product offering_**

Our members have a keen view on value for money. Our track-record has proven that our

members are generally willing to pay membership fees at a premium provided that the quality of
our product offering and their experience justifies this cost. We leverage the feedback and insights
received from our members by investing heavily in our clubs to deliver a premium and
differentiated product proposition. For example, we rolled out our Spa Retreats and grew the
number of Blaze studios across our estate based on membership feedback. Our facilities include
heated indoor and outdoor pools, top class racquet facilities, well-equipped group exercise studios,
luxurious spas, family-oriented club rooms and outdoor spaces, lounges with restaurants and bars,
high-quality gyms as well as a fully complementary digital offering. The success of our product
initiatives is evidenced by the increasing quality scores our facilities have received from members
based on our internal surveys, with the quality of our facilities being endorsed by 92% of our
members in 2019 compared to 73% in 2015.

**_Enhancing the quality of the service that we provide to our members_**

We focus on enhancing the quality of the services we provide to our members by ensuring

that our clubs are staffed with great personnel who are motivated and engaged with the business.
Accordingly, we will continue to select our staff carefully and invest in their training to deliver
consistent, high-quality service to our members. Every new staff member receives formal training
during which they learn about our clubs and our culture and receive bespoke training in customer
service to ensure they are capable of delivering the premium experience our members expect. We
also have ongoing training for our staff covering health and safety protocols, as well as an online
training academy from which all employees can access a variety of courses, including child
safeguarding and a wide range of technical training. Our personal trainers and coaches are selected
in accordance with strict standards in order to ensure that they can deliver up-to-date advice on
training, fitness, nutrition and lifestyle changes to our members. In recognition of the pivotal role
our employees play in executing our strategy and delivering premium member services, we pay
the majority of our staff at levels above minimum wage and provide them with a comprehensive


-----

benefits package, including a club membership that allows them to use our facilities and gain a
first-hand understanding of our members’ needs. Based on regular employee surveys, employee
engagement improved from 80.0% in 2015 to 94.4% in 2019. We also consistently rank on the
Sunday Times’ Top 25 Best Companies to work for in the U.K. list.

**_Increasing member satisfaction_**

The combination of our high-quality facilities and outstanding customer services allows us

to maintain and increase our members’ satisfaction, leading to our members becoming advocates
for our business, with our Net Promoter Score increasing from 22.0 in 2015 to 57.2 in 2019,
according to our own survey. We intend to deploy a number of new initiatives in order to keep our
members engaged and maintain consistently high satisfaction levels. Since the start of the COVID19 pandemic, we have deployed an extensive digital and social media strategy that enhances our
members’ experience and exploits the power of digital commerce. For instance, both our website
and @home app allow online booking of group classes, and we continue to focus on delivering
fully complementary digital solutions to our members. Our strategy to increase member
satisfaction also hinges on our “clubiness,” as we believe that members value our clubs as a place
to socialize in a family-friendly setting. We will continue to put the social scene at the core of our
offering by organizing a wide spectrum of social events at our clubs and ensuring that our
members’ needs are always taken into consideration.

**_Growing our membership base_**

Our strong and experienced sales team will continue to sell our high-quality offering which

is synonymous with the significant recognition of the “David Lloyd” brand in the markets in which
we operate. In order to increase our membership base, our sales process is organized to encourage
potential members to visit our clubs and experience the full range of our facilities and services,
rather than choosing a club based on price alone. Our sales and marketing activities are also
benefiting from our increasing focus on digitalization and the rollout of our @home app. In order
to cater for situations where prospective members are unwilling or unable to visit our clubs before
purchasing a membership, we now offer a digital joining process, which has generated
approximately £11 million in revenue from its inception to April 2021. We view digital and social
media as an important new channel of communication with prospective members, and this vision
has been further strengthened by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our social media
presence enables us to tailor our communications to each individual member based on factors such
as demographics and usage patterns, thereby enhancing the relevance of our member
communications and increasing each member’s engagement with their club. We will continue to
advertise our offering through a broad range of media platforms in the U.K., both nationally and
locally, including television, radio as well as all major social media platforms.

Our sales and marketing efforts have successfully increased our membership base at a

CAGR of 8.5% from 452 thousand as of 2015 to 626 thousand as of 2019 and at a CAGR of 2.5%
from 449 thousand as of 2015 to 496 thousand as of 2019 (on a like-for-like basis). Our
membership growth was achieved thanks to consistent net member gains during the same period,
with an average of 37.4 thousand net new members added each year between 2015 and 2019. In
addition, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had identified approximately ten of our clubs that
were approaching their maximum capacity, which indicates ample room for further growth of our


-----

like-for-like membership base. The charts below illustrate the growth of our total membership
base, net new members and average yield:

**_Confidently pricing membership fees_**

We will continue to collect feedback from our members and measure members’ satisfaction

with the quality and availability of our product offering and the prices paid for membership. Our
pricing strategy reflects our understanding, based on feedback, that our members are willing to
pay premium prices for a premium offering as members have acknowledged our investments in
our clubs and accepted price increases linked with improved quality and availability of our product
offerings and customer service. We generally announce price increases to our existing members
highlighting and reflecting investments that improve the facilities in their clubs. We
simultaneously update the membership fees for new members of the relevant clubs to reflect the
improvements at those clubs. Since 2016, we have delivered annual yield growth in excess of
annual retail price index (“RPI”) increases while continuously growing our membership base. In
addition, if based on certain capacity indicators, we identify clubs that are reaching their maximum
level of utilization, we implement price increases to manage the utilization levels at those clubs,
which allows us to generate further yield and EBITDA growth. For example, prior to the COVID19 pandemic, we had identified a small number of our clubs with limited excess parking or class
booking availability at peak times, and implemented price increases as demand for those clubs
exceeded availability. We intend to maintain our successful pricing strategy in order to continue
to deliver accretive and sustainable profit growth while continuing to increase our membership
base.

**_Reinvesting our growing profits_**

Enabled by our strong cash conversion, we will continue to reinvest our growing profits

into our estate in order to modernize, refurbish and expand our portfolio and thereby further
improve our product offering and enhance the quality of our services, which in turn drives
members’ satisfaction and yield growth, which can then be reinvested, creating a virtuous circle
that is proven and sustainable and which constitutes the basis of our strategy.

As our members value the quality of their clubs, we will continue to refresh and improve

our facilities with the latest, highest-quality offering and equipment. Capital expenditures are an
essential part of our strategy, and we have invested approximately £284 million into refurbishing
and transforming our clubs over the last six years. By October 2020, we had rolled out Spa Retreats
at a select number of clubs located in our most affluent catchment areas, which provide members
with a high-end, luxurious wellness experience and deliver significant uplift in club Adjusted


-----

EBITDAR. For example, we invested £3.6 million in the rollout of the Spa Retreat in our Royal
Berkshire club in the first half of 2019 and achieved a 31% return on investment with an increase
of £1.1 million in club Adjusted EBITDAR for the twelve months ended February 29, 2020 (based
on the club Adjusted EBITDAR for the eleven-month period April 2019 to February 2020, runrated for a twelve-month period), compared to the club Adjusted EBITDAR for the twelve months
ended prior to the investment of the capital expenditure. We have also been developing our free
weight capacity, adding more Olympic platforms on our gym floors and increasing the space in
our studios, and plan on bolstering our offering of onsite self-administered health products such as
cholesterol and DNA tests while also adding massage and stretching rooms to our clubs, offering
members a more bespoke fitness experience.

Historically, returns on Investment Capital Expenditure have been strong. Phase 1 of our

investment plan was completed in 2014 and comprised a £22.1 million investment into 18 clubs,
an average of £1.2 million per club. Phase 2 was completed in 2015 and comprised a £18.8 million
investment into 18 clubs, with an average of £1 million per club. Phase 3 was completed in 2016
and comprised a £32.4 million investment into 41 clubs, with an average of £800,000 per club. We
achieved a 43% return on investment from phase 1 with an increase of £9.5 million in club
Adjusted EBITDAR for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, a 42% return on investment from
phase 2 with an increase of £7.9 million in club Adjusted EBITDAR for twelve months ended June
30, 2017 and a 48% return on investment from phase 3 with an increase of £15.5 million in club
Adjusted EBITDAR for the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, in each case compared to the club
Adjusted EBITDAR for the twelve months ended prior to the investment of the capital expenditure.

**_Expanding our footprint in the U.K. and in Europe via selective value-enhancing strategic_**
**_acquisitions_**

We have implemented a successful acquisition strategy since Glenn Earlam joined the

Group in 2015, pursuing value-enhancing investments which have granted us access to new
catchment areas and increased our membership base. We proactively manage our club portfolio
by pursuing value-enhancing strategic acquisitions of small portfolios as well as standalone sites
in Europe, in line with our overall growth plan.

Prospective acquisitions are consistently assessed according to strict investment criteria, as

we look for a demonstrated ability to deliver returns both on a standalone and an aggregate basis.
We seek locations in a catchment area that has a significant affluent target population within a 20
minute drive, ideally without a competing club in the catchment area. A detailed demographic
analysis of the catchment area allows us to calculate a potential membership number for the site
to determine maximum club size and potential profitability. We then produce a detailed model for
each new site, using assumptions based on local catchment area characteristics and similar clubs
from our existing portfolio. Our approach enables us to determine the layout, mix of facilities,
membership categories and pricing characteristics of each club on an individual basis.

Our value accretive greenfield expansions are generally assessed on a single site basis,

given the factors associated in finding a suitable catchment area for a premium club. The
economics of sale and leaseback transactions allow us to maximize our return on our Pipeline
Capital Expenditure spend on greenfield expansions by combining a one-off profit on the sale of
the freehold of the club, with EBITDA generation by the club during our leasehold period. For


-----

example, we spent approximately £13 million in Pipeline Capital Expenditure to develop our
Emersons Green club in 2018 and 2019, which was expected to generate a mature EBITDA of
£2.6 million per year, and in December 2020, we sold the site for a net consideration of £21.1
million, representing an immediate profit of approximately £8.1 million. Simultaneous with the
sale, we agreed with the buyer to lease the club for an annual rent cost of £1.1 million, generating
a mature club EBITDA of £1.5 million per year. We will endeavour to use cash on balance sheet
or a prudent mixture of equity and debt to finance any future acquisitions. In addition, we will
continue to use complex data-analytics to assess new opportunities, which has been a key to our
well-proven record of both successful acquisitions and organic openings.

While our operations are currently primarily concentrated in the U.K., we expect to consider
further international sites via selective, value-enhancing strategic acquisitions of small portfolios
as well as standalone sites in Europe, in line with our overall growth plan. In particular, we see
significant growth potential in our current offerings in Europe, having already identified
approximately 700 potential development sites across the continent. Our European clubs
represent a differentiated proposition in several European markets with affluent demographics
and we believe there are no competitors of scale in the premium segment of the health and
fitness market. Our recent acquisition of eight clubs in Germany has significantly increased our
penetration into one of the most important European markets. This acquisition also provides a
blueprint for further strategic and selective European expansion into markets with high
membership growth potentials and low penetration rates.

**History**

We were founded in 1982 by David Lloyd, former captain of the British Davis Cup tennis

team, who recognized that the U.K. had very few indoor sport and leisure facilities and sought to
create high-quality fitness destinations suitable for the whole family. Our first club was opened in
Heston, West London, and is still operating and open as of the date of this Offering Memorandum.
By 1991, we had grown to five domestic clubs, including our first acquisition in Eastbourne, on
England’s southeast coast. Following our initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange in
1993, we were subsequently acquired by British leisure operator Whitbread in 1995, at which point
we totaled 18 clubs in the U.K.

After eight years of steady domestic growth, our international expansion began in 2003

with the acquisition of five Cannon health clubs in The Netherlands, allowing us to reach a total
of 57 clubs, followed by club openings in Barcelona and Brussels in 2005. In 2007, we were
acquired by London & Regional and the private equity arm of HBOS (now Caird Capital).
Following this acquisition, our existing business was merged with 19 Next Generation clubs, and
our former CEO Scott Lloyd oversaw the successful integration of a total of 88 clubs in the U.K.
and Europe to extract synergies and implement best practice across the entire portfolio.

In 2013, we were purchased by TDR Capital, who believed in our potential to grow by

investing capital across the existing estate, expanding into new geographies and significantly
enhancing our customer proposition through a series of operational improvement initiatives. Under
TDR Capital’s ownership, we have undertaken and completed a major capital investment program,
making significant improvements in the style and range of facilities available to members across


-----

our estate, and also expanded our footprint via selective, value-enhancing strategic acquisitions of
small portfolios as well as standalone sites in the U.K. and Europe.

In 2015, Glenn Earlam joined David Lloyd as CEO. In addition to our refurbishment

program, Glenn has also focused on a number of operational initiatives aimed at improving our
customer service delivery, lowering customer attrition and bolstering brand awareness. In the same
year, we launched a new site development program, which led to the opening of 11 new clubs,
including five in Europe (Antwerp, Madrid, Milan, Geneva and Frankfurt).

In 2017, we acquired 14 racquet clubs from Virgin Active in the U.K. and also opened four

individual new clubs. In 2020, we increased our European portfolio from 14 to 22 clubs by
purchasing eight clubs from Meridian Spa & Fitness in Germany, thereby establishing a growth
platform for our most important European target market. In the same year, we also purchased a
country club in the affluent, high-potential Bellevue suburb of Geneva.

While we continue to execute an accretive capital expenditure program across the acquired

estate, we also remain focused on our product offerings, with the launch of our “@home” mobile
app in March 2020 and the use of digital touch points in our clubs as part of our increased focus
on digital offerings. Our @home app reinforces our offer and generates large, easily convertible
standalone digital opportunities that maximize the utility of our membership and allows us to keep
pace with new socioeconomic trends spurred on by the COVID-19 pandemic. See “—Overview of
_our offering—Digital offering.”_

**Our clubs**

As of March 31, 2021, we had a total of 122 clubs, 99 of which were in the U.K., one in

the RoI, two in Belgium, six in The Netherlands, nine in Germany, one in France, one in
Switzerland, one in Italy and two in Spain, and approximately 580 thousand members. On a pro
_forma run-rate adjusted basis, pre-COVID-19 pandemic, we had approximately 668 thousand_
members as of December 31, 2019.

Our business model focuses on operating a portfolio of appropriately located clubs, with

each site located in close proximity to an affluent demographic population, ideally with no similar
competition in the catchment area. All of our clubs are well-invested, to justify premium pricing,
and we have long-term concessions of 25 years or more on the majority of our portfolio in order
to minimize rental expense and maximize operational flexibility. We emphasize the quality of our
offering and expert delivery of multiple products and services, and we focus on member
engagement and a tailored communication strategy in order to stay in touch with our members
frequently and effectively. We believe that this model results in higher margins and increased
secondary revenue, high cash generation and visibility of earnings, significant member retention,
high brand awareness and correspondingly lower marketing spend per new member.

**_Overview of our offering_**

Our facilities include state-of-the-art gyms, heated indoor and outdoor pools, top-class

racquet facilities, well-equipped group exercise studios, luxurious spas, family-oriented club
rooms and outdoor spaces, lounges with restaurants and bars as well as a fully complementary
digital offering. Our clubs are open seven days a week, usually from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. on weekdays


-----

and from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on weekends. We believe that our family friendly environment, together
with the range and breadth of our facilities, results in longer customer dwell-time, increased
secondary spending, higher market penetration and improved retention rates. Our highly
differentiated offering relies on six core pillars: “clubiness”; family; wellness; sports; fitness and
digital offering.

_Clubiness_

Our club rooms and outdoor spaces encourage member interaction and provide a social,

destination environment where members can relax and socialize in a vibrant setting. We pride
ourselves upon our local and often member self-started societies among our clubs, which build
loyal communities centered around common interests and create a distinctive “clubs with clubs”
culture. This culture encourages the sense of community and belonging that being part of a club
can generate, as evidenced by our “We Time” ethos.

We also organize a wide spectrum of social events such as music themed nights, quiz

evenings and barbecues to drive member engagement and retention, all of which are always
tailored to meet our local members’ needs. In addition, a number of our training options, such as
tennis leagues and running and triathlon clubs, feature a strong social element to encourage
participation via group coaching and friendly competitions.

Most of our clubs have lounges with restaurant service and licensed bar, which represents

our largest source of ancillary revenue (47.5% of ancillary revenue (including retail and other
revenue) in the year ended December 31, 2019). We offer a variety of menu and pricing options
based on club demographics and size, including vegetarian and vegan options as well as a
condensed menu for smaller clubs. Many of our outdoor pool areas also have a barbecue or other
food and beverage service, thereby creating a destination area in the summer months. We regularly
update our menus in response to member feedback to maximize the appeal of our food and
beverage offering. We have introduced our DLicious range of healthy food in our clubs, with a
focus on speed, quality and service. Our chefs and nutritionists, working together with our health
and fitness teams, have created a healthy, balanced menu using natural ingredients, which helps
our members enjoy the benefits of healthy eating. Most recently, we have enhanced our offering
with a deli-style grab-and-go offering in partnership with the Yo-Sushi brand, as well as barista
service and freshly prepared smoothies.

More recently, we have been focusing on offering our members quiet spaces within our

clubs to allow them to work directly from our premises. Our dedicated adult-only business lounges
have been designed so that members are given sufficient flexibility to take advantage of our health
and fitness facilities while tending to their professional duties, in line with the recent workingfrom-home trend spurred on as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As an increasing number of
our members are choosing or needing to work from home, we seek to facilitate the transition to a
comfortable, reliable remote working environment by offering on-site spaces to work from,
thereby further strengthening our “clubiness.” As of March 31, 2021, all of our clubs offered large
and spacious lounges with complimentary WiFi access. In addition, we offer dedicated adult-only
lounges and business hubs in a select number of clubs.


-----

_Family_

Our clubs are open to all ages and have a distinctive family focus, which we believe

enhances member engagement, promotes membership retention and differentiates us from our
competitors. Our distinctive family offering is evidenced by the fact that as of March 31, 2021,
approximately two thirds of our members were families and couples, leading our clubs to become
an integral part of the families’ lives.

We believe, based on management estimates, that we are one of the largest U.K. child

activity providers as we offer extensive facilities for children (who represented approximately a
quarter of our members as of March 31, 2021), including daycare, crèches, structured activity
programs with approximately five thousand kids lessons offered across a broad range of
disciplines, kids play-frames, child-friendly tablets, dedicated splash pools and family friendly
areas such as soft play and DL Kids activity areas, family lounges and family changing rooms. We
provide birthday parties for children (which also serve as marketing events for potential new
members) as well as other family events, including parties at Christmas, Halloween and Easter,
and designated family swimming times in our pools. The broad range of facilities and activities
that we offer makes our clubs an ideal destination for families to spend time together after school,
on the weekends and during school holidays.

As of March 31, 2021, all of our clubs offered child daycare facilities, with daycare hours

coordinated with our exercise class timetable. We also have a wide variety of children’s tennis and
swimming classes through our All Stars programs for children aged 3–11, with up to 40 lessons
per week on offer. Our All Stars programs focus on developing major motor skills, improving
fitness levels and social interaction while having fun. Our children’s programs operate 48 weeks
of the year, thereby maximizing member participation and engagement outside of the school term
timetable and creating a “resort-like,” year-long experience.

The DL Kids Holiday Club is available during school holidays to children aged 5–13 on a

daily or weekly basis. It offers structured programs tailored to specific age groups, including sports
sessions, fun swimming, arts and craft activities, theatre, as well as lunch and breaks during the
day. We have also developed a Fitness-Into-Teens (FIT) program for children aged 10 and above.
It is designed for “aspiring adults” and includes group exercise, gym, swimming and tennis
activities to encourage fitness and a healthy lifestyle in a social environment. Children at our clubs
also benefit from 4G pitches, all of which complement our extensive outdoor facilities and thereby
encourage dwell-time for the entire family.

As the population continues to age, we are also committed to offering bespoke services to

older people. As of March 31, 2021, 18.5% of our membership base was over the age of 55.
Inspired by UKactive’s Reimagining Ageing report, we have recently committed to having one
fitness trainer aged 55 or over per club on average by the end of 2022.

_Wellness_

Our clubs feature mind and body studios that allow our members to find peace of mind

through yoga, meditation and tai chi classes. In addition, our high-quality wet spa facilities provide
a holistic health and wellness offering for members, offering a relaxation space for adults only,


-----

including jacuzzi, sauna and steam facilities. We also offer a range of treatments, including
aromatherapy, massage, acupuncture and beauty treatments. Many of our clubs offer
physiotherapy and physical rehabilitation services with qualified physiotherapists.

In addition, our members also enjoy access to dedicated mind and beauty studios and can

visit the Spa Retreat at a select number of our U.K. clubs. Our Spa Retreat is the flagship of our
wellness offering, providing members with a high-end, luxurious experience with heat treatment
rooms, salt saunas, heated beds and sound meditation pods. The Spa Retreats facilities span both
indoors and outdoors, with dedicated spa gardens segregated into adult-only areas reaching up to
2000 sq ft. The high-end design of our Spa Retreat has started to trickle down to our smaller clubs,
with an increasing number of wellness facilities being developed in these locations too.

Lastly, in order to complement our wellness offering, many of our clubs offer additional

services, such as nutritional educational programs, hairdressers, barbers, beauty care and various
on-demand tutorials. These services are often offered in the form of “pop-up” stands on our
premises, which are operated via concessions.

_Sports_

Our clubs provide members with a wide range of premium racquet sports and swimming

facilities and offer tuition from leading professional coaches.

The majority of our clubs offer a range of tennis, squash, badminton and/or padel courts,

in addition to our traditional health and fitness facilities. A key driver of our racquet offering is the
fact that our clubs are typically located in affluent areas, with an average penetration of our target
demographic groups in the club’s catchment area of approximately 1.8% across the U.K., and
penetration of up to 4% in some clubs. As of March 31, 2021, we had more than 1,050 matchquality tennis courts (more than half of which are indoors), as well as 365 squash and badminton
courts. The strength of our racquet sports offering is exemplified by the high occupancy rate of
our courts, which can be as high as 87.4% during the winter months.

Our leading junior tennis coaching program offers tennis lessons to up to 15 thousand

children each year. Children with a competitive spirit can join our squad program to train at a
higher frequency within smaller groups and play against neighboring teams on weekends. In
addition, we also offer structured programs for adults, coaching and leagues to encourage member
participation, frequency of visits and longer dwell-time, which in turn drives secondary spending
by our members and improves retention. Our members enjoy access to SmartCourts in a select
number of clubs, a state-of-the-art technology which uses advanced image processing and
analytical algorithms to capture and log stroke type, ball trajectory, speed and spin, in-depth shot
data and player movement. Our clubs are also home to vibrant communities of tennis-lovers, with
competitions, group coaching sessions, league tables and social events enhancing our “clubiness”
and contributing to our competitive offer. As such, we believe that our extensive racquet facilities
differentiate us from the rest of the market and represent a significant advantage over our
competitors. As of March 31, 2021, 88.9% of our clubs in the U.K. offered racquet sports facilities,
we operated 117 squash courts and, based on management estimates, we operated approximately
36% of the indoor tennis courts in the U.K. private sector.


-----

We also have an extensive swimming program, with 196 indoor and outdoor swimming

pools across the U.K as of March 31, 2021. Our pools are suitable for both intensive training and
leisure, while shallow, splash pools at most clubs and trained lifeguards on constant watch further
reinforce our family offering. Our cutting-edge facilities allow us to foster communities of
swimming enthusiasts in our clubs, thereby further contributing to the success of our “clubs with
_clubs” culture. As of March 31, 2021, we had more than 700 qualified swimming teachers and up_
to 24 thousand children learn to swim with David Lloyd All Stars each year (starting at age 18-36
months), all of which are operative across the entire year thanks to our heated indoor pools. Our
clubs also offer swimming squads for children, in line with our tennis program. As of March 31,
2021, we operated approximately 25% of the lidos in the U.K. private sector.

_Fitness_

Gym facilities

All of our clubs offer extensive health and fitness facilities. Our gym facilities combine

free weights areas, functional training zones with Plyo boxes, sled tracks, Synrgy 360 training
frames and TRX straps, and a wide array of low-impact cardio equipment and weight machines.
Our facilities are consistently refreshed and kitted out with the latest, highest-quality equipment,
and currently include state-of-the-art Life Fitness machines with interactive screens, Woodway
treadmills, Concept 2 rowers, Wattbikes, SkiErgs, Assault bikes and stages solo bikes with ondemand group content, among others. We seek the best pieces of kit from individual suppliers
instead of using the same ones for various categories of equipment, which allows us to benefit
from a low supplier concentration risk and maintain a consistently high standard for our services.

Most recently, we have been developing our free weight capacity by increasing the number

of Olympic platforms on our gym floors, and have also bolstered our offering of onsite selfadministered health products such as cholesterol and DNA tests, all of which offer members a
more bespoke fitness experience. While we try to maximize the availability of fitness equipment
(approximately 120 pieces per club on average), we are also cognizant of the need for more spacedout facilities. As such, we have made a conscious effort to offer our members a larger personal
space within which to exercise, and also added massage and stretching rooms to our gyms.

Group exercise

Group exercise is a key member retention driver of our business. We pride ourselves upon

offering members content that is entirely unique, as we produce and create our own music and
fitness videos, and also train our instructors to deliver bespoke “signature” classes that can only
be attended at our clubs. We offer a large number and wide variety of fitness classes, including
our Blaze and Ignite high intensity interval training, Spirit yoga and Pilates classes, the Cyclone
and Rhythm cycling classes as well as general strength and conditioning circuit sessions. In order
to maintain the appeal of our clubs, protect our members and employees and mitigate the health
risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we strive, to the extent possible, to offer group classes in
an outdoor setting. The majority of our classes are now offered on an individual basis too. Members
can book a particular piece of gym equipment or training area in advance, and then follow an
online recording of the class they wish to follow alone, using their headphones, which affords them


-----

extra flexibility in their fitness journey. During the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately
25% of our members participated in group exercise.

Our extensive group exercise offering has been developed to match the level of expertise

that boutique-style gyms offer in a particular area across a much broader range, thereby offering a
“one stop shop” with the highest level of services. According to our management estimates,
customers are on average 60% less likely to leave if they enroll in group classes. Lastly, group
classes can also generate significant ancillary revenue, with approximately £2.1 million worth of
gym accessories such as boxing gloves and heart rate systems having been sold during the year
ended December 31, 2019.

Personal trainers

As of March 31, 2021, we had more than 600 qualified personal trainers who deliver

approximately 700 thousand sessions per year to help our members achieve their health and fitness
goals and seamlessly navigate across our facilities. We believe that our extensive personal training
program increases member engagement and reduces membership turnover. Personal training
represented our second largest source of ancillary revenue (18.5% of ancillary revenue (including
retail and other revenue) in the year ended December 31, 2019), and has been one of the largest
drivers of overall ancillary revenue growth over the past four years, with a compound annual
growth rate of 6.8% from 2015 to 2019.

All of our personal trainers hold at least a Register of Exercise Professionals (REP) Level

3 qualification and undergo in-house training at our David Lloyd Campus to ensure they can give
consistent, up-to-date advice on training, fitness, nutrition and lifestyle changes, and also uphold
social distancing protocols. Our personal trainers are trained to use massage guns on our members,
and place as much emphasis on the recovery process as they do on training.

Following the First Lockdown, we have revisited our personal training program by offering

shorter sessions at lower prices. We also put in place group personal training sessions for groups
of up to 8 people for more price-sensitive members and those less familiar with personal training,
which foster comradery and further stabilizes our “sticky” membership base. We are adapting
certain of our clubs to better accommodate personal training sessions, with more open space and
non-traditional resistance equipment, such as TRX straps and kettle bells. Thanks to the large size
of our facilities, we have been able to swiftly adapt to new safety protocols imposed in connection
with the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing our personal trainers to maintain steady activity levels
following the reopening of our facilities.

_Digital offering_

On March 23, 2020, we were one of the first U.K. fitness, health and leisure operators to

offer a remote exercise platform through the launch of our “@home” mobile app. @home offers
our members a weekly timetable of fitness classes and interactive events and an extensive library
of on-demand classes and tailored workout plans, all of which are designed by our professional
staff. In addition, @home allows prospective members to buy membership without in-club
support, thereby shortening the inquiry to conversion process and reducing drop-offs, while
existing members can also digitally book and purchase group classes and personal training. The


-----

videos posted on @home have recorded over 2 million views from 275 thousand unique users
from its launch to March 31, 2021, with members using the app not only for our signature fitness
classes, but also for social events such as cooking classes, quiz nights and make up tutorials.

The success of our new digital solutions is exemplified by the connected bike trail launched

during the Second Lockdown with our Milton Keynes members, which was oversubscribed. We
intend to invest more resources into similar events in the future, as we believe that bike rentals can
provide an alternative source of revenue when members are unable to physically attend classes.
Between July and October 2020, we estimate that 15,000 additional classes were made available
and 45,000 additional bookings were generated thanks to our @home app. In addition to our
@home app, we have also recently started rolling out our @table app, which allows members to
place restaurant orders from their mobile devices, thereby limiting physical exposure to staff and
enhancing safety in our newly reopened clubs.

Overall, our unique digital ecosystem reinforces our offer and generates large, easily

convertible standalone digital opportunities that maximize the utility of our membership. We
deploy medical-grade body composition monitoring devices across our facilities in order to allow
our members to accurately track their progress. Our investment in technology through digital touch
points is coupled with partnerships with ancillary service providers tailored to our local members’
needs, such as Boditrax and Myzone, whose services are integrated into @home.

**_Membership base_**

We offer a variety of membership options to provide our members with the greatest degree

of flexibility. Prospective and current members can deal with all aspects of the subscription process
both onsite at one of our clubs, or digitally via our @home app. We offer two principal types of
membership duration:

- Standard: 12-month initial term for a particular club, terminable on three months’ notice
thereafter; and

- Flexible: a three-month initial term for a particular club, terminable on one month’s notice
thereafter.

Given the premium nature of our offering, our membership is also heavily weighted towards

the most affluent members of society, with 58% of member households earning over £60,000 per
annum compared to the U.K. national average of 18% as of December 31, 2019.

Within each contract type, we have different categories which vary depending on the

facilities used and the time of such use. For instance, the “Club Membership” allows members, at
a lower price, to use their club at off–peak times during the day without access to certain facilities.
We also offer special rates for couples, families, children and corporate members as well as twoweek trial periods in April, August and December. Our individual adult membership fees range
from £44 to £325 per month, depending on the location, facility and type of club. From time to
time, we make promotional offers available for specified periods (e.g., “Join now and pay no


-----

joining fee”). Membership fees are generally payable monthly by direct debit or annually with an
upfront payment.

We focus on attracting and retaining a wide range of members. We have relatively large

bases of older demographics and families, who have markedly lower attrition rates than single,
younger members. This sticky membership base is resilient and allows us to generate significant
recurring subscription revenue, which in the year ended December 31, 2019, represented 78.2%
of our total revenue for that year.

As of December 31, 2019, children and individuals aged at least 50 comprised half of our

membership base, as illustrated below:

We engender a high degree of loyalty from established members, with individuals who

have been members for over 18 months remaining members for an average of seven years, thereby
generating a robust and recurring membership stream which underpins our business model.

**_International_**

We have 22 clubs outside the U.K. and RoI and expect to consider further international

growth via selective, value-enhancing strategic acquisitions of small portfolios as well as
standalone sites in Europe, in line with our overall growth plan. Our European clubs accounted for
18.4% of our Pro Forma Run Rate Revenue and 18.6% of our Pro Forma Run Rate Adjusted
EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Germany_

We have nine clubs in Germany, located in Homburg, Frankfurt, Berlin and Kiel. Our

German clubs offer a mix of racquet and health and fitness facilities, as well as large-scale saunas
and steam rooms, physiotherapy, sunbeds, child daycare and indoor and outdoor swimming pools.
Our clubs in Germany range in size from 24,972 sq ft to 63,776 sq ft, with membership size ranging
from 2,052 to 6,776 members. Eight of our nine German clubs were acquired from Meridian Spa
& Fitness in Germany in 2020, which has allowed us to establish a growth platform for our most
important European target market.

_The Netherlands_

Our six clubs in the Netherlands are located in Amsterdam, Capelle aan den Ijssel,

Eindhoven, Rotterdam and Utrecht. Our Dutch clubs offer a mix of racquet and health and fitness
facilities, as well as saunas and steam rooms, physiotherapy, sunbeds and child daycare and indoor


-----

pools. Our clubs in the Netherlands range in size from 35,686 sq ft to 101,712 sq ft, with
membership size ranging from 2,920 to 4,493 members. We have implemented a number of
operational changes and improvements in our clubs in the Netherlands, which have helped to
counteract the effects of a weak economy and heightened competition.

_Belgium_

We have two clubs in Belgium.

- Brussels: our club in Brussels is located in a former chateau in an affluent suburb south of
Brussels. The club has been extensively refurbished, and includes five indoor and six outdoor
tennis courts, a relaxation area including a lounge, two saunas, a steam room and a jacuzzi as
well as a bar and restaurant, hair and beauty salon, child daycare and nursery and indoor and
outdoor pools. It is 98,938 sq ft in size and had 6,879 members as of March 2021.

- Antwerp: our club in Antwerp opened its doors in 2015 and is located just off Prins
Boudewijnlaan road, a stone’s throw from Zandbergen Park. The Antwerp club features two
swimming pools, four indoor tennis courts, four outdoor tennis courts and high-end gym
equipment and relaxation facilities. The club size is 56,179 sq ft and had 3,096 members as of
March 2021.

_Spain_

We have two clubs in Spain.

- Barcelona: we acquired our club in Barcelona in 2003. Though it was originally a traditional
tennis club, we have expanded it to offer our full range of services. Located at the end of
Avenida Diagonal, it is convenient to public transportation and the University of Barcelona.
The club’s facilities include 12 tennis courts, 12 padel courts, multiple indoor, outdoor and
children’s pools, a function suite, a café, a restaurant and a spa. The club size is 58,205 sq ft
and had 4,110 members as of March 2021.

- Madrid: we acquired our club in Madrid in 2015. Located in the Valdemarin area of Aravaca,
a short drive from Madrid city center, our Madrid club features two pools, outdoor tennis
courts, three exercise studios and state-of-the-art child care and coaching facilities. The club
size is 53,596 sq ft and had 3,165 members as of March 2021.

_Ireland_

Our club in Ireland is located in the affluent Clonskeagh area of Dublin. In addition to its

extensive gym facilities, the club offers 13 tennis courts (ten indoor and three outdoor), two squash
courts, two swimming pools (one indoor and one outdoor) and a spa with sauna, steam room and
whirlpool. Leisure facilities include a DLicious café, a TV lounge, a hair and beauty salon and
function suite. For children, the club offers daycare and three kids rooms. The club is 138,504 sq
ft in size and had 5,952 members as of March 2021.


-----

_France_

Our club in France is located on the French side of the Franco-Swiss border, by Lake

Geneva. The club offers a mix of premium facilities including 15 tennis courts, three padel
courts and one full -size football pitch, among others. The club size is 117,420 sq ft and it had
2,691 members as of March 2021.

_Italy_

Our club in Italy opened in 2017 following an extensive investment program. Located on

the east side of Milan, the club is a strong fit within our family-focused brand and is ideally situated
to serve a large and active membership. Our Malaspina club is a large, well-established and familyfriendly center offering a vast range of health and fitness facilities, including an Olympic-size
swimming pool, 15 tennis courts and three padel courts, one full -size football pitch, gym facilities,
a luxurious spa and an exclusive cafébar, all of which are spread across a beautiful six hectare
parkland site. The club size is 58,587 sq ft and had 2,691 members as of March 2021.

_Switzerland_

Our club in Switzerland was acquired in September 2020 on a freehold basis. It is a

premium sports and wellness club located on the outskirts of Geneva, offering 11 tennis courts, a
fitness space, a golf driving range and a major spa area. The club size is 57,000 sq ft and it had
1,250 members as of March 2021.

**_New Club Development_**

We have opened five new clubs since December 2017 (excluding Meridian), two of which

were in the U.K. Our Acton Park club opened in 2018, following a £9 million investment program.
The Acton Park club includes a wide range of family facilities for children, including tennis and
swimming coaching programs, kids clubs and holiday camps, a crèche and indoor soft play area,
several cutting-edge fitness facilities, including its PRAMA, Blaze and group cycling studios, both
an indoor and outdoor swimming pool, a luxurious wet spa and an exclusive new restaurant. As of
March 31, 2021, it had 5,237 members. In 2019, we opened our 99[th] U.K. club at Emersons Green,
Bristol. Our Emersons Green club offers four group exercise studios, an indoor spa, an outdoor
heated swimming pool, three air bubble tennis courts, a cafébar and our standard high-end child
care facilities. In addition to opening new clubs, we also invest considerable resources into
refurbishing our existing clubs in order to maintain our competitive advantage, with our
Cambridge, Chigwell and Warrington clubs all having undergone multi-million pound makeovers
in 2019. More recently, our clubs in Northwood and Cheadle were refitted during the First
Lockdown and now feature a Spa Retreat (for more information on our wellness offering and Spa
Retreats, see “—Overview of our offering—Wellness”).

We continually evaluate potential new clubs and properties to add to our portfolio, using

complex data-analytics to assess both internal growth via organic openings as well as external
growth by way of value-enhancing strategic acquisitions. In each case, we consider new sites on
an individual basis, subject to a demonstrated ability to deliver returns both on a standalone and
an aggregate basis. We seek locations in a catchment area that has a significant affluent target
population within a 20 minute drive, ideally without a competing club in the catchment area. A


-----

detailed demographic analysis of the catchment area allows us to calculate a potential membership
number for the site to determine maximum club size and potential profitability. We then produce
a detailed model for each new site, using assumptions based on local catchment area characteristics
and similar clubs from our existing portfolio. This approach enables us to determine the layout,
mix of facilities, membership categories and pricing characteristics of each club on an individual
basis. If our model indicates a sufficient level of profitability, a detailed business case is presented
for board approval, following which we enter into the relevant legal documentation and obtain any
necessary planning or other approvals. The use of data-analytics to conduct due diligence on
potential new clubs and properties is the key to our well-proven record of both successful
acquisitions and greenfield openings.

It typically takes approximately two years to develop a new club, from the time the site is

identified to opening. Once opened, clubs can take up to four years before achieving their target
member base and up to four years to achieve their target profitability. Given their large footprint,
the availability of sites of sufficient size can be an impediment to the development of new clubs
and the identification of suitable targets. Notwithstanding, we currently have identified a number
of U.K. sites with potential for new club developments in the next two years.

Applying our advanced data-analytics to the European market, we currently see potential

for approximately 700 potential sites across Europe. We believe that there are currently no
European competitors of significant scale in the premium health and fitness market segment, which
presents us an opportunity to capture additional market share through organic growth and
opportunistic acquisitions. In order to achieve our expansion plans in Europe, we also engage in
the acquisition and redevelopment of existing clubs, targeting cities such as Madrid, Barcelona,
Brussels, Antwerp, Milan and Geneva. In addition to an adequate catchment area population, our
criteria for these redevelopments include a minimum site area and gross internal area, as well as a
minimum number of car parking spaces.

**Competition**

Competition in the health, fitness and leisure market in the U.K. is fierce and principally

on a local basis. Because of the breadth of our offering across racquet sports, swimming pools, spa
and wellness and high-quality gym facilities, we have a wide spectrum of competitors, including
private racquet clubs, hotels, tennis facilities, as well as a broad range of clubs in the health and
fitness sector ranging from other premium clubs to middle market, low cost gyms and boutique
gym studios such as Barry’s Bootcamp and SoulCycle. We also experience competition from
public gyms and leisure centers, and alternative leisure facilities such as golf clubs and active
holiday locations. In terms of our children’s facilities, we compete with youth football and rugby
leagues, kids camps and family holiday locations such as CenterParcs.

Among private multi-site health and fitness clubs in the U.K., we believe that our principal

competitors are Virgin Active, which also operates in the premium segment and which has the
broadest tennis facilities among our competitors, and Nuffield Health, Bannatynes and Fitness
First in the mid-market segment. We compete principally on the basis of facilities and experience
offered, family friendliness and breadth of services. We believe that we do not have any direct
scale competitors within the premium segment of the health and fitness market.


-----

**Sales and marketing**

Our sales and marketing activities are targeted at both new member acquisition and existing

member retention. We advertise through a broad range of media platforms in the U.K., both
nationally and locally, including television and radio as well as various internet platforms. As a
result, we benefit from high brand awareness as a premium health and fitness club, with an 86%
brand recognition in the U.K. as of March 31, 2020, according to a recent study. Our sales process
is organized to encourage potential members to visit our clubs and experience the full range of our
facilities and services, rather than choosing a club based on price alone. Marketing and product
development is organized centrally at our head office and implemented through our club network,
with marketing tactics tailored to the catchment area of each club. Sales teams are located at each
club and each club has specific targets to increase membership through new sales and retention.

We have a sophisticated, comprehensive and targeted member communications program

in place, covering the duration of a member’s lifetime with us to encourage a high level of
engagement. All members receive the benefits of a bespoke welcome program pursuant to which
their individual needs are assessed to ensure the highest possible engagement. Holders of a flexible
three-month membership are offered to upgrade to a 12-month membership, and we run a program
of e-mail communications for low or flexible users to encourage use, based on detailed member
use records and an analysis within our leaver propensity model. We have also developed a
sophisticated algorithm from our extensive database of member behavior that allows us to target
members at risk of leaving, so that we may encourage them to increase their usage and engagement
with their club in order to postpone or prevent attrition.

We have developed a digital and social media strategy to enhance our members’ experience

and exploit the power of digital commerce. Our website attracts both prospective and current
members and is optimized for display on mobile devices. In addition, our mobile app allows
members to view club timetables, access a club finder, see news and events, trainer profiles and
video and photo guides, and check in each time they visit their club. Both our website and app
allow online booking of group classes and tennis courts. We are also present on all major social
media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram. Our social media presence
enables us to tailor our communications to each individual member based on factors such as
demographics and usage patterns, thereby enhancing the relevance of our member
communications and increasing each member’s engagement with their club. During the First
Lockdown and the Second Lockdown, we leveraged our strong social medial platform to engage
with and support our club members by publishing videos on the topics of mental health and
wellness. Our sales and marketing activities are directly benefiting from our increasing focus on
digitalization and the rollout of our @home app, with digital joining generating approximately £11
million in revenue from its inception to April 2021. We view digital and social media as an
important new channel of communication with our members, and this vision has been further
strengthened by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. See “—Overview of our offering—Digital
_offering.”_

Our sales and marketing strategies are organized by our Marketing Director, who work in

conjunction with our Sales Director and Club Operations management team. Our Sales Director is
supported by Regional Sales managers who have dotted line access to Club Sales Managers. Each
club has a Sales Manager and a team of Sales Consultants. All new sales staff undergo a three to

four week in-club induction, followed by a sales and marketing course. They are then given weekly
coaching sessions and attend a Sales Excellence course after four to six months. See “—
_Employees—Training.”_

**Property**

Our head office is located at The Hangar, Hatfield Business Park, Hatfield, Hertfordshire

AL10 9AX. Our clubs generally fall into three categories: freehold clubs, which are owned
freeholds in relation to which we could initiate a sale and leaseback process, long leasehold clubs,
which are leaseholds running for at least 50 years, and short leasehold clubs, which are leaseholds
with market rent running for less than 50 years. In addition, we also hold purchase call options on
our clubs in Geneva and Malaspina, which are currently held on leaseholds. As of the year ended
December 31, 2019, none of our clubs accounted for more than 2.2% of our total revenue. Based
on a third-party valuation as of December 31, 2017, the total value of our real estate portfolio was
approximately £700 million.

The majority of our clubs are held via long-term concessions, which allows us to minimize

rental expense and maximize operational flexibility. As of March 31, 2021, 53 of our leasehold
clubs (or 44.9% of our total leaseholds) had an unexpired term of 50 years or more, 34 (or 28.8%
of our total leaseholds) had an unexpired term of 25 to 50 years, 17 (or 14.4% of our total
leaseholds) had an unexpired term of 15 to 25 years, 11 (or 9.3% of our total leaseholds) had an
unexpired term of 5 to 15 years and 3 (or 2.5% of our total leaseholds) had an unexpired term of
less than 5 years.

All of our leasehold clubs with an unexpired term of less than 50 years are leased under

standard fully insuring and repairing operating leases. Of our clubs under operating leases, 49 are
leased from M&G, 15 are leased from London & Regional, with the remainder leased from various
other parties. Our M&G leases may only be forfeited in limited circumstances, which exclude
forfeiture for insolvency or change of control. The terms of the operating leases for our clubs have
expiry dates between 2022 and 2041. All of the leases are subject to rent reviews, which vary on
a club-by-club basis. While some have five year market value reviews, others are linked to the
retail price index and others still provide for fixed annual rent increases. The majority of our short
leases in the U.K. and our M&G long leases are subject to annual rent increases.

**_Freehold clubs_**

We currently hold four clubs on freehold, none of which are in the U.K.: Capelle (76,255 sq

ft), Antwerp (56,179 sq ft), Geneva Country Club (57,000 sq ft) and Aravaca (53,596 sq ft).

**Environmental matters**

We are subject to a variety of national and local environmental laws and regulations

relating to land use, environmental protection and health and safety in connection with our
ownership of real property and other operations. While we could incur costs, such as clean-up
costs, fines and third-party claims for property damage or personal injury as a result of violations
of or liabilities under such laws or regulations, we believe that we substantially comply with the
applicable requirements of such laws and regulations and have implemented a continuous program
of reporting against a comprehensive set of internal controls. These laws and regulations are
constantly changing, however, as are the priorities of those who enforce them. We cannot assure
you that environmental conditions relating to any of our prior, existing or future properties will
not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See
“Risk factors―Risks relating to the regulatory environment―We could be subject to material
_fines and claims related to health and safety risks at our clubs.”_

We have also undertaken a number of initiatives to reduce the environmental impact of our

clubs. These include reducing flow rates in changing room showers and improving the efficiency
of pool and filter cleaning to reduce water consumption, and installing energy efficient lighting
and combined heat and power generators to optimize electricity usage.

**Intellectual property**

We rely on trademark and copyright laws, confidentiality provisions and contractual

provisions to protect our intellectual proprietary rights. We regard our intellectual property as a
valuable asset in the marketing of our products. We market our products and services under various
trademarks, including “David Lloyd,” “DL,” “DL Kids,” “DL cafébar,” “Amida Spa,” “Life Be
Fit for It,” “Harbour Club,” “The Clubroom,” “Blaze,” “Rhythm,” and “Battlebox.” Where we
believe it to be appropriate, we have registered these and related trademarks and the other
trademarks that we use in our business. We currently have no patents or patent applications
pending. Although we actively take steps to protect our intellectual property rights when and where
we deem appropriate, we cannot assure you that such steps will be sufficient. See “Risk
_factors―Risks relating to our business and industry―Our intellectual property rights, including_
_trademarks and trade names, may be infringed, misappropriated or challenged by others.”_

**Information technology**

Our business depends on the ability of our employees to process transactions on secure

information systems and on our capacity to store, retrieve, process and manage information. We


-----

outsource most of our IT infrastructure needs through a variety of third-party suppliers. BT Global
Services provides our data center and disaster recovery facilities and Gamma provides hybrid SDWAN facilities. We continually review the suitability and performance of our IT applications and
are planning to upgrade or replace a number of legacy systems over the next three years.

Our principal front-office system is Club Centric, which, along with our other information

technology, supports a number of key functions:

    - Membership management, including member type, multi-club access, monthly
billings and renewals;

    - Front desk management, including check-in, bookings, waiting lists, subscription and
other payments, and printing photo membership cards;

    - Court, class and treatment timetables and bookings;

    - Point of sale payments for the front desk, retail spaces and food and beverage
services; and

    - Sales and marketing, including managing prospects, demographic reporting,
membership and package renewal reporting and free trial reporting.

IT also forms a core part of our sales and marketing strategy, and we use our website and

@home app to attract new members, increase member engagement and facilitate use of our clubs
and services, thereby driving member retention. Our increased focus on our digital capabilities as
a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has helped us unlock new sources of value by lowering our
costs of delivery and offering members more access to tailored content. We cannot guarantee you
that we will be able to protect these processes and systems against unexpected adverse events. See
“Risk factors―Risks relating to our business and industry― Disruptions and failures involving
_our information technology systems could adversely affect member enrolment, member services_
_and financial and administrative functions.”_

**Insurance**

We maintain insurance cover for the risks associated with the operations of our business,

including property reinstatement, business interruption (other than in relation to the COVID-19
pandemic), material damage, public, product and employee liability, terrorism, cyber, travel and
motor, directors and officers and engineering. We utilize a recognized insurance broker firm,
Willis Towers Watson, to advise on all insurance matters and run our annual renewal process
where cover and deductibles are reviewed from first principles each year. All our policies are
underwritten by reputable insurance providers. Although we believe that our insurance coverage
is sufficient for the risks associated with our operations, we cannot guarantee that no losses will
be incurred or that no claims will be filed against us which go beyond the type and scope of the
existing insurance coverage, and we do not insure against biological, nuclear or terrorism risks.
See “Risk factors―Risks relating to our business and industry―We may be unable to maintain
_the required level of insurance cover on acceptable terms or at an acceptable cost.”_


-----

**Regulatory matters**

Our operations are subject to governmental regulation concerning, among other things,

consumer and data protection, the advertisement, promotion and sale of our products and services
(including membership contract terms), product safety, the health, safety and working conditions
of our staff and employees (in particular in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic), the safety
of our clubs and their accessibility for the disabled, food and beverage regulations and our
competitive conduct in the marketplace. We believe that we are in compliance in all material
respects with these regulations. We cannot assure you, however, that any future changes in the
requirements or mode of enforcement of these laws and regulations will not have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See “Risk
_factors―Risks relating to the regulatory environment―We could be subject to material fines and_
_claims related to health and safety risks at our clubs.”_

**Legal proceedings**

We are involved in legal, regulatory, tax and administrative proceedings arising in the

ordinary course of our business. The proceedings initiated against us may include, among others,
the following categories of claims: claims by or on behalf of customers on grounds such as breach
of health and safety regulations (in particular as a result of the new protocols imposed in connection
with the COVID-19 pandemic), personal injury, child care, food contamination, privacy and
unauthorized access or intellectual property claims; claims by landlords and suppliers; claims by
employees; claims by tax authorities with respect to tax matters such as VAT, transfer taxes and
property tax; and claims by other administrative bodies or agencies such as claims for breach of
data protection or consumer protection regulations.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we are not aware of any legal, administrative,

judicial, regulatory, tax or arbitral proceedings or investigations (including any pending or
threatened proceedings or investigations) that are likely to have, or have had, individually or in the
aggregate, a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of
operations. The outcome of legal proceedings and investigations, however, can be extremely
difficult to predict with certainty, and we can offer no assurances in this regard. As of March 31,
2021, we had recognized reserves of £0.8 million in respect of pending litigation matters. On April
21, 2018, a child drowned in one of the swimming pools at our Leeds club. On February 15, 2020,
Wakefield Coroner’s Court ruled that the death was the result of an accident, and that David Lloyd
was not criminally liable for it. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we expect Leeds
City Council to press further charges against us, but no action has been initiated yet and we
therefore cannot assess our likelihood of success in the event of further litigation.

**Employees**

**_Our workforce_**

The table below sets forth our average number of full time equivalent (“FTE”) for the

periods indicated:


-----

**Financial Year**

**2018** **2019** **2020**

U.K. ............................................................... 4,287 5,102 4,920
_Ireland ..........................................................._ 93 92 58

_Belgium .........................................................._ 56 49 57

_Netherlands ..................................................._ 178 189 180

_France ..........................................................._ 37 53 45

_Italy ................................................................_ 25 32 28

_Spain .............................................................._ 83 116 100

Total overseas ................................................ 491 566 516

**Total ..............................................................** **4,778** **5,668** **5,436**

Labor expenses per average FTE employee have remained stable in recent years, at £26.6

thousand in 2018 and 2019 and £25.3 thousand in 2020.

In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2019, we had 5,483 persons working at

our clubs on a self-employed basis, including certain tennis instructors, swimming instructors and
personal trainers, and whose compensation is not included in our labor costs. The number of those
working on a self-employed basis fluctuates in order to meet demand.

None of our employees are members of unions. We believe that our relations with our

employees are good and have not experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages.

**_Training_**

The quality of our staff is a key factor in driving new member sales, customer engagement

and membership retention. Accordingly, we invest heavily in training our employees to deliver
consistent, high-quality service to our members. Every new staff member receives formal training
typically lasting three months during which they learn about our business and our clubs, and
receive bespoke training in customer service and applicable technical skills. We also have specific
training based on the employee’s role. For example, all sales staff receive an intensive week-long
training program at the David Lloyd Leisure Campuses at our clubs in Dudley and Heston, during
which they are trained in our sales processes and techniques to ensure consistency, integrity and
efficacy. We also have ongoing training for our staff covering matters such as health and safety
and customer service, and assist eligible employees in obtaining a National Vocational
Qualification or other professional qualifications. Training is delivered both by employees who
are involved in training our staff on a full-time basis and internal professional trainers who deliver
training in addition to their day-to-day roles. We also have an online training academy from which
all employees can access a variety of courses, including child safeguarding, anti-bribery legislation
and a wide range of technical training.


-----

**_Health and safety_**

Health and safety are paramount to the operation of our clubs. As part of our training

process, particular emphasis is placed on safety and health protocols. Following the reopening of
our clubs after the First Lockdown and the staggered reopening of our facilities after the Second
Lockdown, our staff completed dedicated COVID-19 workshops in order to ensure compliance
with the latest safety protocols, while also increasing the number of our trained cleaning staff,
introducing the use of fully virucidal disinfectant cleaner and sanitization stations as well as
spacing out group classes to allow for a more thorough cleaning process between sessions. We
also closely follow government guidelines in each country in which we operate and directly work
in tandem with UKactive, a U.K.-based not-for-profit body overseeing the health and fitness
industry, in order to ensure strict compliance with industry standards. Since the end of the First
Lockdown, we have reduced the overall capacity of our clubs, increased space between individual
pieces of equipment on gym floors, introduced one-way circulation system across our facilities
and also introduced plastic screen at our reception desks to protect members and staff as well as
signage and clear floor markings across our facilities. Lastly, our trained lifeguards and instructors
constantly patrol our gym, racquet and swimming facilities in order to monitor and prevent onsite
accidents.

**_Pensions and benefits_**

We do not operate a defined benefit pension scheme. All our employees are currently

eligible to participate in a Group Personal Pension Plan established by us but to which we do not
contribute. In addition, we also operate a “NEST” scheme to comply with regulations introduced
by the UK Pensions Regulator to encourage all employees to contribute to a pension plan. Both
employers and employees are required to contribute to this scheme, which is operated on an optout basis. We do not pay for insurance or private healthcare for our employees but make such
cover available to our staff through a flexible benefits scheme. Outside of the U.K., we follow
domestic regulations in each of the jurisdiction into which we operate and offer pensions and
benefits in accordance therewith, for instance with a pension plan offered to general managers only
in the Netherlands.

**_ESG and others_**

In line with our members’ growing concern for our business’ impact on the environment,

we constantly strive to improve our environmental performance. We are one of the few recipients
in the leisure sector of the prestigious Carbon Trust Double Standard, in recognition of our efforts
to reduce energy consumption and waste, and also the first company in the U.K. leisure sector to
be granted a self-supply water license. We measure our carbon footprint per member visit and rely
on data insight, operational best practice across our clubs and investment into new utility reduction
technologies to ensure compliance with applicable environmental norms. For the year ended
December 31, 2019, we emitted approximately 113.3 thousand carbon tonnes (consisting of 68%
of gas, transport, refrigerant and fuel emissions, 19% of purchased goods, construction and
refurbishment, waste, water and travel emissions and 13% of electricity emissions), and we are
committed to reducing our overall carbon emissions to net zero by 2030. We have a proven trackrecord of successfully implementing utility-related initiatives to decrease our carbon footprint,
having invested approximately £8 million of capital expenditures into well-established


-----

technologies since 2018, such as LED upgrades to our tennis court lighting, building management
systems and other improvements to our heating and cooling infrastructure. These initiatives have
allowed us to decrease our carbon footprint by 7.7% between 2017 and 2018, and to reduce our
emissions by a further 3.5 thousand tonnes during 2019. Since 2019, we have also committed to
purchasing electricity from renewable sources, allowing us to decrease our carbon emissions by
10 thousand tonnes in 2019 and 2020, and also expect the photovoltaic panels installed at our
Luton site in October 2020 to generate over 20% of this club’s electricity requirements and to
reduce our carbon emissions by 50 tonnes per annum.

**Management Incentive Program**

Certain senior executives of the Group are compensated via our management incentive

plan (the “MIP”), pursuant to which they are allowed to purchase class B, C, D and E ordinary
shares of HoldCo. Members of the MIP must remain employees of the Group in order to retain
their entitlement to proceeds, but there are no other vesting conditions. The intrinsic value (being


-----

the difference between the cash paid for and the fair value of the shares) at the date of grant is
recognized as an equity-settled share based payment and spread on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period.

On February 14, 2019, 192,500 D ordinary shares and 216,800 E ordinary shares with a

nominal value of £1 each were issued by Holdco to senior managers for a consideration of £10 per
share. On August 1, 2019, 10,000 D ordinary shares and 28,150 E ordinary shares with a nominal

**Audit Committee**

Our Audit Committee assists management in discharging its responsibilities with regard to

financial reporting, internal and external audits and internal control and risk management. The
Audit Committee’s main role is to provide independent and objective assurance that there is an
appropriate control structure throughout the Group. To achieve its objectives, the Audit Committee
reviews the Group’s annual accounts prior to their submission to the Board, monitors the controls
intended to ensure the integrity of the financial information reported to shareholders, advises on
the appointment of external auditors and reviews risk assessment procedures.

**Remuneration**

The Group’s directors are not directly remunerated by the Group. The Group provides

compensation to its key management personnel in the form of short-term employee benefits, postemployment benefits and termination benefits. The aggregate compensation paid by the Group to

TDR Capital LLP is a leading private equity firm that managed funds of up to €10 billion

by Manjit Dale and Stephen Robertson, who were previously partners at DB Capital Partners. TDR
Capital LLP has an experienced team of investment professionals and operating partners and has
a low-volume investment strategy based on principles developed by the investment team over the
past decade. TDR Capital LLP seeks to spend significant resources on each investment and to
focus on operational excellence through a tested and integrated operating partner model.

Intense pre-investment analysis and post-investment involvement mean that TDR Capital

LLP is selective, typically making only one to three investments a year. TDR Capital LLP takes
an active role in overseeing the operations of its investments, working in partnership with
management through board representation and professional support.

TDR Capital has been a longstanding supporter of the business, having acquired the

Company in 2013, and has since supported the management team on its growth journey in
transforming the business into one of Europe’s leading health & leisure club operators. To date,
TDR Capital has completed 22 investments across the leisure, consumer, business and financial
services sectors. Some examples of current and prior TDR Capital investments include
Hurtigruten, ASDA, Euro Garages, Pizza Express and Stonegate Pub Company.

In connection with the Transactions, TDR will make a £100 million equity injection into

the Company as part of the Equity Contribution

**Certain relationships and related party transactions**

We have entered into various agreements or transactions with certain related parties from

time to time. These agreements and transactions are carried out on arm’s length terms and we
believe that the terms of these agreements are no more favorable to the related parties and our
affiliates than what they would have been with disinterested third parties.

The following summary describes our material related party transactions.

HoldCo. See “Management—Management Incentive Program.”

services, actively monitors the operations of the Group and evaluates strategic transactions and
other initiatives that TDR Capital LLP views as potentially beneficial for the Group. For the year
ended December 31, 2020, the management fee charged by TDR Capital LLP to the Group was
£2.0 million and for the three months ended March 31, 2021, the management fee charged by TDR
Capital LLP to the Group was £0.5 million. As of March 31, 2021, £2.5 million of historical

_the material provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not purport to be complete and is_
_subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the underlying documents._

_The following is a summary of certain provisions of the financial arrangements to which_

_Deuce Midco Limited (the “Parent”) and certain of its subsidiaries are or will become party in_
_connection with the Transaction and the application of the proceeds therefrom as described in_
_“Use of Proceeds”. It does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety_

**New Revolving Facility Agreement**

**_New Revolving Facility_**

The New Revolving Facility Agreement will provide for a multicurrency revolving credit

facility in an aggregate amount of £125,000,000 (the “Revolving Facility”). The Revolving Facility
may be drawn by way of cash advances or the issue of letters of credit or ancillary facilities.
Amounts drawn under the Revolving Facility are permitted to be applied, directly or indirectly, in
whole or in part, by the Parent towards (a) the refinancing, purchasing or otherwise discharging of
indebtedness of the restricted group and the Meridian restricted group, (b) the reorganization of
the restricted group in contemplation of effecting the Transaction, and (c) related transaction costs.
In addition, the Revolving Facility may be used by any borrower towards the general corporate
purposes and/or the working capital requirements of the restricted group (including for any
acquisitions or capital expenditure).

In addition, the Parent may elect to request additional facilities either as new facilities or

as additional tranches of the Revolving Facility (the “Revolving Incremental Facilities”). The
Parent and the lenders in respect of the Revolving Incremental Facilities may agree to certain terms
in relation to the Revolving Incremental Facilities, including the margin and the termination date
(subject to parameters as set out in the New Revolving Facility Agreement). The indebtedness
incurred under the Revolving Incremental Facilities must be otherwise permitted under the New
Revolving Facility Agreement.

Subject to the terms of the New Revolving Facility Agreement, other members of the

restricted group may accede as borrowers and guarantors of the Revolving Facility.

**_Maturity and Availability Period_**

The Revolving Facility matures 66 months after the date of completion of the Transaction

(the “Closing Date”).

The Revolving Facility is available to be drawn from and including the date of the New

Revolving Facility Agreement to and including one (1) month prior to the maturity date specified
in the paragraph above.

**_Interest and fees_**


-----

Loans under the New Revolving Facility Agreement will initially bear interest at the

aggregate of 3.25% per annum and (in the case of Loans in euros) EURIBOR or (in the case of
Loans in pound sterling) SONIA plus a spread adjustment, as applicable.

The margin for each loan under the New Revolving Facility Agreement will be subject to

adjustment by reference to the consolidated senior secured leverage ratio as shown in the quarterly
financial statements or, as the case may be, the annual financial statements for that relevant period
and the related compliance certificate, to equal the rate per annum set out in the following table:

**Revolving Facility**

**Consolidated senior secured leverage ratio** **margin (% p.a.)**

Greater than 4.50: 1.00......................................................................... 3.25

Equal to or less than 4.50:1.00 but greater than 4.00:1.00................... 3.00

Equal to or less than 4.00:1.00............................................................. 2.75

Following an initial public offering ..................................................... 2.50

The margin on any loans under the Revolving Incremental Facilities will be agreed between

the Parent and the relevant lenders.

If EURIBOR or SONIA (as applicable) is less than zero, EURIBOR or SONIA (as

applicable) shall be deemed to be zero in respect of any loan under the New Revolving Facility
Agreement.

Commitment fees are payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the

Revolving Facility for the relevant periods set out in the New Revolving Facility Agreement at a
rate of 30% of the applicable margin. Generally, the commitment fee is payable quarterly in
arrears, on the last day of availability of the Revolving Facility and if cancelled, on the cancelled
amount of the relevant lender’s commitment under the Revolving Facility at the time such
cancelation is effective.

Default interest is calculated as an additional 1% per annum on any overdue amount. The

Parent is also required to pay (or procure the payment of) customary agency and arrangement fees
in connection with the Revolving Facility.

**_Repayment_**

All outstanding amounts under the Revolving Facility are required to be repaid on the

relevant maturity date referred to above.

Loans under the Revolving Facility must be repaid on the last day of the interest period

relating thereto, subject to a netting mechanism against new loans under the Revolving Facility to
be drawn on such date.

The termination date in respect of a Revolving Incremental Facilities will be the date agreed

between the Parent and the relevant lenders.

**_Prepayment_**


-----

The New Revolving Facility Agreement allows for voluntary prepayments (subject to a

minimum amount and certain conditions).

The New Revolving Facility Agreement also permits each lender to require the mandatory

prepayment of all amounts due to that lender upon a change of control of the Parent or a sale of
the whole or substantially the whole of the business and assets of the restricted group.

**_Guarantees_**

The Revolving Facility is guaranteed by the Guarantors and the Issuer.

The New Revolving Facility Agreement includes a “Guarantor Coverage Threshold”

(being, subject to certain exceptions, the requirement that the Consolidated EBITDA of the
Guarantors represent not less than 80% of the Consolidated EBITDA of the members of the
restricted group excluding any member of the restricted group that is not required to become a
guarantor in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles). If the Guarantor Coverage
Threshold is not met when tested by reference to delivery of the annual financial statements of the
Parent for the relevant year, within 60 days each Material Company that is not already a guarantor
(together with such other members of the restricted group as necessary) shall become guarantors
under the New Revolving Facility Agreement in order to meet the Guarantor Coverage Threshold
at that time. “Material Company” is generally defined under the New Revolving Facility
Agreement to include, among other things, any member of the restricted group that is incorporated
or established in a Security Jurisdiction and that has earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
amortization and exceptional items representing more than 5% of consolidated EBITDA. “Security
_Jurisdiction” is defined in the Agreed Security Principles as being (i) England and Wales, and (ii)_
any other jurisdiction in which, based upon the most recent annual financial statements delivered
under the New Revolving Facility Agreement, members of the restricted group incorporated in
that jurisdiction (disregarding the earnings from ordinary activities before interest, taxation,
depreciation, amortization and exceptional items (calculated on the same basis as Consolidated
EBITDA, mutatis mutandis) (“Jurisdiction Entity EBITDA”) of any such member of the restricted
group that generates negative Jurisdiction Entity EBITDA) account for 15 per cent. or more of
consolidated EBITDA. The Agreed Security Principles provide that no member of the restricted
group incorporated or established outside of a Security Jurisdiction shall be required to provide
any guarantee or security (unless such member is a borrower of the Revolving Facility) and no
member of the restricted group shall be required to provide any security in respect of any shares
or other ownership interests held in any member of the restricted group incorporated or established
outside of a Security Jurisdiction or any member of the restricted group which is not an obligor
under the New Revolving Facility Agreement.

**_Security_**

The New Revolving Facility Agreement is secured by the same security interests granted

as security for the Notes. See “Description of the NotesSecurityThe Collateral.”

**_Representations and Warranties_**


-----

The New Revolving Facility Agreement contains certain customary representations and

warranties (subject to certain exceptions and qualifications and with certain representations and
warranties being repeated), including (but not limited to) status, binding obligations, non-conflict
with other obligations, power and authority, authorizations, no default, governing law and
enforcement, sanctions and anti-corruption laws.

**_Covenants_**

The New Revolving Facility Agreement contains certain of the incurrence covenants and

related definitions (with certain adjustments) that are included in the section entitled “Description
_of the NotesCertain Covenants.” In addition, the New Revolving Facility Agreement contains a_
financial covenant (see “Financial Covenant.”)

The New Revolving Facility Agreement also contains a “notes purchase condition”

covenant. Subject to certain exceptions set out in the New Revolving Facility Agreement, the
Parent may not, and shall procure that no other member of the restricted group will, repay, prepay,
purchase, defease, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire the principal amount of the Notes (but
excluding any amount outstanding under any “finance document” entered into in respect of the
New Revolving Facility Agreement) prior to its scheduled repayment date in any manner which
involves the payment of cash consideration by a member of the restricted group to a person which
is not a member of the restricted group. The exceptions to such covenant include, _inter alia,_
generally, payments that do not exceed 50% of the aggregate original principal amount of the
Notes in existence as of the date of their issuance or incurred at any time after their issuance.

The New Revolving Facility Agreement also requires certain members of the restricted

group to observe certain affirmative covenants, including covenants relating to maintenance of
Guarantor Coverage Threshold on an annual basis (see “Guarantees” above) and further
assurance with respect to security interests granted. In addition, the New Revolving Facility
Agreement also requires to the Equity Contribution to occur no later than 10 business days after
the Issue Date.

Certain of the covenants under the New Revolving Facility Agreement will be suspended

including upon the long-term corporate credit rating of the Parent (or any holding company of the
Parent) being equal to or better than Baa3 or BBB-, according to Moody’s Investor Services, Inc.
and Standard & Poor’s Investors Ratings Services, respectively.

The New Revolving Facility Agreement also contains an “information covenant” under

which, among other things, the Parent is required to deliver to the agent annual financial
statements, quarterly financial statements and compliance certificates.

**_Financial Covenant_**

The New Revolving Facility Agreement requires that the Parent shall ensure that the

consolidated leverage ratio in respect of each period of twelve months ending on any quarter date
(the “Consolidated Leverage Ratio”) shall not be greater than (i) from the quarter date ending on
30 June 2022 to the quarter date ending 31 March 2023, 9.50:1.00 and (ii) thereafter, 9.25:1.00,
provided that this financial covenant is only to be tested if on the last day of such period, the


-----

amount drawn under the New Revolving Facility Agreement is greater than 40% of the total
revolving facility commitments.

The Parent is permitted (subject to certain conditions) to prevent or cure breaches of the

Consolidated Leverage Ratio covenant by applying a “cure” amount (generally, amounts received
by the Parent in cash pursuant to any new equity or permitted subordinated debt) as if consolidated
EBITDA had been increased by such amount or consolidated leverage had been reduced by such
amount. There is no requirement to apply any cure amount in prepayment of the Revolving
Facilities. No more than four different cure amounts may be taken into account prior to the maturity
date of the New Revolving Facility Agreement and cure amounts in consecutive financial quarters
are not permitted.

**_Events of Default_**

The New Revolving Facility Agreement contains a limited number of events of default

(misrepresentation, unlawfulness, failure to comply with the financial covenant (subject to cure)),
subject in certain cases to agreed grace periods and other qualifications. Additionally, the New
Revolving Facility Agreement mirrors the events of default applicable to the Notes.

**_Governing law_**

The New Revolving Facility Agreement is governed by English law.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under our financing arrangements,

the Parent, the Issuer and certain other members of the Group which have acceded or otherwise
become a party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a debtor (together the “Debtors”) are parties to
the Intercreditor Agreement between, among others, Global Loan Agency Services Limited as
Revolving Agent, Barclays Bank PLC as Revolving Arranger, GLAS Trust Company LLC as
Senior Notes Trustee and Deuce MidCo Limited as the company as amended and/or restated from
time to time. The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law and sets out, among other
things, the relative ranking of certain indebtedness of the Debtors, the relative ranking of certain
security granted by the Debtors, when payments can be made in respect of certain debt of the
Debtors, when enforcement action can be taken in respect of that indebtedness, the terms pursuant
to which certain of that indebtedness will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain
insolvency events and turnover provisions.

**_Restrictions Relating to Second Lien Creditors and Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, prior to the later of the Super Senior Discharge

Date and the Senior Discharge Date, the Debtors shall not, and the Parent shall procure that no


-----

other member of the Group will, make any payment of the Permitted Second Lien Financing
Liabilities at any time unless that payment is permitted by the provisions set out below under the
captions “Permitted Second Lien Payments,” “Permitted Second Lien Enforcement,”
“Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims” or by a refinancing of the Permitted Second Lien
Financing Liabilities as permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement.

_Permitted Second Lien Payments_

Prior to the later of the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Discharge Date, any

member of the Group may make payments with respect to the Permitted Second Lien Financing
Liabilities (such payments, collectively, “Permitted Second Lien Payments”):

(a) if:

(i) the payment is of:

(A) any of the principal amount of the Permitted Second Lien Financing
Liabilities which is either (1) not prohibited from being paid by the
Revolving Finance Documents or the Senior Debt Documents or (2) paid
on or after the final maturity date of the relevant Permitted Second Lien
Financing Liabilities (subject to certain conditions); or

(B) any other amount which is not an amount of principal or capitalized interest;

(ii) no Second Lien Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding; and

(iii) no payment default under the Revolving Finance Documents has occurred and is
continuing (the “Super Senior Payment Default”);

(iv) no payment default under the Senior Debt Documents has occurred and is
continuing (the “Senior Payment Default”); or

(b) if (X) the Majority Revolving Lenders (the “Required Super Senior Consent”) and (Y) a
Senior Notes Trustee and the Majority Permitted Senior Financing Creditors or the
Permitted Senior Creditor Representative in respect of that Permitted Senior Financing
Debt (as applicable) (the “Required Senior Consent”) give prior consent to that payment
being made;

(c) if the payment is of certain amounts due to the Permitted Second Lien Creditor
Representative for its own account;

(d) of any costs and expenses of any holder of security in relation to protection, preservation
or enforcement of such security;

(e) of costs, commissions, taxes, fees and expenses incurred in respect of or in relation to (or
reasonably incidental to) any of the Permitted Second Lien Financing Documents
(including in relation to any reporting or listing requirements under such documents);


-----

(f) if the payment is funded directly or indirectly with the proceeds of any indebtedness
incurred under the Permitted Second Lien Financing Documents and/or Senior Parent
Notes;

(g) if the payment is funded directly or indirectly with the proceeds of a Shareholder
Contribution or Subordinated Debt; or

(h) any other amount not exceeding £5,000,000 in aggregate in any financial year of the Parent.

On or after the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Discharge Date, the Debtors
may make payments in respect of the Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities at any
time.

_Second Lien Payment Blockage Provisions_

Until the later of the Super Senior Discharge Date (except with the Required Super Senior

Consent) and the Senior Discharge Date (except with the Required Senior Consent), no Debtor
shall make (and the Parent shall procure that no other member of the Group will make), and no
Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditor may receive from any other members of the Group, any
Permitted Second Lien Payment (other than roll-up or capitalization of any amount or certain
amounts due to the Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representative for its own account and subject
to certain other exceptions) if:

(a) a Super Senior Payment Default or a Senior Payment Default is continuing; or

(b) a Material Event of Default is continuing, from the date which is one business day after the
date on which the Revolving Agent and/or the Senior Agent delivers a payment stop notice
(a “Second Lien Payment Stop Notice”) specifying the event or circumstance in relation to
that Material Event of Default to the Parent, the Security Agent, the Senior Parent Notes
Trustee and any Senior Parent Creditor Representative until the earliest of:

  - the date falling 120 days after delivery of that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice;

  - in relation to payments of the Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities, if a Second
Lien Standstill Period is in effect at any time after delivery of that Second Lien Payment
Stop Notice, the date on which that standstill period expires;

  - the date on which the relevant Material Event of Default has been remedied or waived in
accordance with the applicable Revolving Finance Documents or Senior Debt Documents,
as applicable;

  - the date on which the Revolving Agent or Senior Agent, as applicable, has delivered the
relevant Second Lien Payment Stop Notice delivers a notice to the Parent, the Security
Agent and the Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representative cancelling the Second Lien
Payment Stop Notice;

  - the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Discharge Date have occurred; and


-----

  - the date on which the Security Agent or a Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representative
takes Enforcement Action permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement against a Debtor.

Unless the Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representative waives this requirement, (i) a

new Second Lien Payment Stop Notice may not be delivered unless and until 360 days have
elapsed since the delivery of the immediately prior Second Lien Payment Stop Notice; and (ii) no
Second Lien Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by a Senior Agent in reliance on a Material
Event of Default more than 75 days after the date that Senior Agent received notice of that Material
Event of Default.

The Revolving Agent and the Senior Agents may only serve one Second Lien Payment

Stop Notice with respect to the same event or set of circumstances. Subject to the immediately
preceding paragraph, this shall not affect the right of the Agents to issue a Second Lien Payment
Stop Notice in respect of any other event or set of circumstances.

No Second Lien Payment Stop Notice may be served in respect of a Material Event of

Default which had been notified to the Agents at the time at which an earlier Second Lien Payment
Stop Notice was issued.

Any failure to make a payment due under any Permitted Second Lien Financing Document

as a result of the issue of a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Super Senior
Payment Default or a Senior Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an Event of
Default (as defined in any Permitted Second Lien Financing Document) as a consequence of that
failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Permitted Second Lien Financing Document;
(ii) the issue of a Second Lien Enforcement Notice (as defined below) on behalf of the Permitted
Second Lien Financing Creditors; (iii) any debt-for-equity transaction in respect of Permitted
Second Lien Financing Liabilities; (iv) payment of advisory or professional fees in respect of
restructuring advice and/or valuations in respect of the Debtors provided to the Permitted Second
Lien Financing Creditors not exceeding in aggregate £1,500,000; or (v) payment to the Permitted
Second Lien Financing Creditors of fees in respect of amendments to, and consents or waivers of,
the Permitted Second Lien Financing Documents in amounts not exceeding those paid to the Super
Senior Secured Creditors and the Senior Secured Creditors in respect of amendments to, and
consents or waivers of, the Revolving Finance Documents and the Senior Debt Documents, as
applicable.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

No Debtor shall be released from the liability to make any payment (including of default

interest, which shall continue to accrue) under any Permitted Second Lien Financing Document
by the operation of the provisions set out under each section above under the caption
“Restrictions Relating to Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors and Permitted Second
_Lien Financing Liabilities” even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time_
by the terms of any of those provisions.

The accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with the Permitted Second

Lien Financing Documents shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a Second Lien Payment
Stop Notice.


-----

_Cure of Second Lien Payment Stop_

If:

(a) at any time following the issue of a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence
of a Super Senior Payment Default or a Senior Payment Default, that Second Lien Payment
Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Super Senior Payment
Default or Senior Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and

(b) any Debtor then promptly pays to the Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors an
amount equal to any payments which had accrued under the Permitted Second Lien
Financing Documents and which would have been Permitted Second Lien Payments but
for that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice, a Super Senior Payment Default or Senior
Payment Default,

then any event or circumstance specified to be an “Event of Default” in any of the Debt

Financing Agreements (an “Event of Default”) (including any cross default or similar provision
under any other debt document) which may have occurred as a result of that suspension of
payments shall be waived, and any Second Lien Enforcement Notice which may have been issued
as a result of that Event of Default shall be waived, in each case without any further action being
required on the part of the Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors or any other creditor or
Operating Facility Lender.

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors_

Until the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Discharge Date, except with the prior

consent of or as required by an Instructing Group:

(a) no Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditor shall direct the Security Agent to enforce, or
otherwise require the enforcement of any security; and

(b) no Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditor shall take or require the taking of any
Enforcement Action in relation to the Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities,

except as permitted under the provisions set out below under the caption “Permitted
_Second Lien Enforcement.”_

_Option to Purchase: Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors_

Subject to the following paragraphs, any of the Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors

or Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representatives (on behalf of the relevant Permitted Second
Lien Financing Creditors) may, after an acceleration event under the New Revolving Facility
Agreement (a “Revolving Acceleration Event”), a Senior Acceleration Event, the issue of a Second
Lien Payment Stop Notice that is continuing or during a Second Lien Standstill Period that is
continuing, by giving not less than 10 days’ notice to the Security Agent, require the transfer to
such Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors of all, but not part, of the rights, benefits and
obligations in respect of the Revolving Liabilities or the Senior Liabilities if:


-----

(a) that transfer is lawful and, subject to paragraph (b) below, otherwise permitted by the terms
of the Revolving Finance Documents and the Senior Debt Documents pursuant to which
any relevant Revolving Liabilities or Senior Liabilities (as the case may be) remain
outstanding;

(b) any conditions relating to such a transfer contained in the Revolving Finance Documents
and the Senior Debt Documents pursuant to which any Revolving Liabilities or Senior
Liabilities (as the case may be) remain outstanding are complied with other than as specified
in the Intercreditor Agreement;

(c) the Revolving Agent on behalf of the finance parties in relation to the New Revolving
Facility Agreement is paid the amounts required under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(d) the relevant Senior Agents on behalf of the Senior Secured Creditors are paid the amounts
required under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(e) as a result of that transfer the Super Senior Secured Creditors or the Senior Secured
Creditors (as applicable) have no further actual or contingent liability to the Parent or any
other Debtor under the relevant debt documents;

(f) an indemnity is provided from each Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditor (other than
any Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representative) (or from another third party acceptable
to all the Super Senior Secured Creditors or the Senior Secured Creditors (as applicable)) in
a form reasonably satisfactory to each Super Senior Secured Creditor or each Senior Secured
Creditor (as applicable) in respect of all costs, expenses, losses and liabilities which may be
sustained or incurred by any Super Senior Secured Creditor or any Senior Secured Creditor
(as applicable) in consequence of any sum received or recovered by any Super Senior
Secured Creditor or any Senior Secured Creditor (as applicable) from any person being
required (or it being alleged that it is required) to be paid back by or clawed back from any
Super Senior Secured Creditor or any Senior Secured Creditor (as applicable) for any
reason; and

(g) the transfer is made without recourse to, or representation or warranty from, the Super
Senior Secured Creditors or the Senior Secured Creditors (as applicable), except that each
Super Senior Secured Creditor or each Senior Secured Creditor (as applicable) shall be
deemed to have represented and warranted on the date of that transfer that it has the
corporate power to effect that transfer and it has taken all necessary action to authorize the
making by it of that transfer.

At the request of a Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representative (on behalf of all the

Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors), the relevant Revolving Agent and/or Senior Agent
shall notify the Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representatives of the foregoing payable sums in
connection with such transfer.

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, any of the Permitted Second Lien Financing

Creditors or a Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representative (on behalf of all the Permitted
Second Lien Financing Creditors) may, by giving not less than 10 days’ notice to the Security
Agent, require a transfer of the hedging liabilities regulated by the Intercreditor Agreement if, at


-----

the same time, they require a transfer of the Super Senior Liabilities or all the Permitted Second
Lien Financing Creditors (acting as a whole) require a transfer of the relevant hedging liabilities
at any time on or after the Super Senior Discharge Date or a Permitted Second Lien Financing
Acceleration Event has occurred and is continuing or a Second Lien Standstill Period has
commenced and is continuing or a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice has been issued and is
continuing.

The restrictions set out in the caption “Restrictions on Enforcement by Permitted Second

_Lien Financing Creditors” above will not apply if:_

(a) a Permitted Second Lien Financing Event of Default (the “Relevant Second Lien Default”)
is continuing;

(b) the Revolving Agent and each Senior Agent has received a notice of the Relevant Second
Lien Default specifying the event or circumstance in relation to the Relevant Second Lien
Default from the relevant Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representative;

(c) a Second Lien Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

the relevant Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representative may by notice (a “Second Lien
_Enforcement Notice”) in writing notify the Revolving Agent and the Senior Agents of the existence_
of such Permitted Second Lien Financing Event of Default.

_Second Lien Standstill Period_

In relation to a Relevant Second Lien Default, a Second Lien Standstill Period shall mean

the period beginning on the date (the “Second Lien Standstill Start Date”) the relevant Permitted
Second Lien Creditor Representative serves a Second Lien Enforcement Notice on each of the
Revolving Agent and the Senior Agents in respect of such Relevant Second Lien Default and
ending on the earlier to occur of:

(a) the date falling 120 days after the Second Lien Standstill Start Date;

(b) the date the Primary Secured Parties (other than the Permitted Second Lien Financing
Creditors) take any Enforcement Action in relation to a particular borrower or issuer of the


-----

relevant Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities (a “Second Lien Borrower/Issuer”)
or any guarantor of the relevant Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities (a “Senior
_Parent Guarantor”); provided, however, that if a Second Lien Standstill Period ends_
pursuant to this paragraph, the Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors may only take
the same Enforcement Action in relation to the relevant Second Lien Borrower/Issuer or
Second Lien Guarantor as the Enforcement Action taken by the Primary Secured Parties
(other than the Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors) against such Second Lien
Borrower/Issuer or Second Lien Guarantor and not against any other member of the Group;

(c) the date of an Insolvency Event in relation to the relevant Second Lien Borrower/Issuer or
a particular Second Lien Guarantor against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken;

Required Super Senior Consent) and the Senior Agent (acting pursuant to a Required
Senior Consent) has been obtained; and

(f) a failure to pay the principal amount outstanding under any Permitted Second Lien
Financing Document at the final stated maturity of the amounts outstanding under that
Permitted Second Lien Financing Document (provided that unless the Super Senior
Discharge Date and the Senior Discharge Date has occurred or is otherwise agreed pursuant
to a Required Super Senior Consent, a Required Senior Consent and the Parent, the final
stated maturity does not fall on a date prior to the date falling 85 months after the date of
first utilization of the Senior Debt,

(the “Second Lien Standstill Period”).

_Subsequent Second Lien Default_

The Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors may take Enforcement Action under the

provisions set out in caption “Permitted Second Lien Enforcement” above in relation to a
Relevant Second Lien Default even if, at the end of any relevant Second Lien Standstill Period or
at any later time, a further Second Lien Standstill Period has begun as a result of any other
Permitted Second Lien Financing Event of Default.

_Enforcement on Behalf of Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors_

If the Security Agent has notified the Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representatives that

it is enforcing security created pursuant to any security document over shares of a Second Lien
Borrower/Issuer or a Second Lien Guarantor, no Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditor may
take any action referred to under the provisions set out under the caption “Permitted Second
_Lien Enforcement” above against that Second Lien Borrower/Issuer or that Second Lien Guarantor_
(or any subsidiary of them) while the Security Agent is taking steps to enforce that security in
accordance with the instructions of an Instructing Group where such action might be reasonably
likely to adversely affect such enforcement or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom.

(a “Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice”) specifying the
event or circumstance in relation to that Revolving Event of Default, Senior Event of
Default or Permitted Second Lien Financing Event of Default to the Parent, the Security
Agent, the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent Creditor Representative until
the earliest of:

  - the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior
Parent Payment Stop Notice;

  - in relation to payments of the Senior Parent Liabilities, if a Senior Parent Standstill Period
is in effect at any time after delivery of that Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent
Payment Stop Notice, the date on which that standstill period expires;

  - the date on which the relevant Revolving Event of Default, Senior Event of Default and/or
Permitted Second Lien Financing Event of Default has been remedied or waived in
accordance with the applicable New Revolving Facility Agreement, Senior Debt
Document or Permitted Second Lien Financing Document;

  - the date on which the Revolving Agent, Senior Agent or Permitted Second Lien Creditor
Representative which delivered the relevant Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior
Parent Payment Stop Notice delivers a notice to the Parent, the Security Agent and the
other Agents cancelling the Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice;

  - the Primary Discharge Date; and

  - the date on which the Security Agent, the Senior Parent Notes Trustee or any Senior Parent
Creditor Representative takes Enforcement Action permitted under the Intercreditor
Agreement against a Debtor.

Unless the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent Creditor Representative

waive this requirement, (i) a new Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop
Notice may not be delivered unless and until 360 days have elapsed since the delivery of the
immediately prior Super Senior/ Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice; and (ii)
no Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/ Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by the
Revolving Agent, a Senior Agent or a Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representative in reliance


-----

on a Revolving Event of Default, a Senior Event of Default or a Permitted Second Lien Financing
Event of Default more than 45 days after the date that Revolving Agent, Senior Agent or Permitted
Second Lien Creditor Representative received notice of that Revolving Event of Default, Senior
Event of Default or Permitted Second Lien Financing Event of Default.

The Revolving Agent, the Senior Agents and the Permitted Second Lien Creditor

Representatives may only serve one Super Senior/ Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment
Stop Notice with respect to the same event or set of circumstances. Subject to the immediately
preceding paragraph, this shall not affect the right of the Revolving Agent, the Senior Agents
and/or the Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representatives to issue a Super Senior/Senior/Second
Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice in respect of any other event or set of circumstances.

No Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice may be served in

respect of a Revolving Event of Default, Senior Event of Default or Permitted Second Lien
Financing Event of Default which had been notified to the Agents at the time at which an earlier
Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice was issued.

Any failure to make a payment due under any Senior Parent Finance Documents and any

Permitted Parent Financing Documents as a result of the issue of a Super Senior/Senior/Second
Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Super Senior Payment Default, a
Senior Payment Default or a Second Lien Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of
an Event of Default (as defined in any Senior Parent Indenture or any Permitted Parent Financing
Agreement, as applicable) as a consequence of that failure to make a payment in relation to the
relevant Senior Parent Notes Finance Document and any Permitted Parent Financing Documents;
or (ii) the issue of a Senior Parent Enforcement Notice (as defined below) on behalf of the Senior
Parent Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

Neither the relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer nor any other Debtor shall be released from

the liability to make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue)
under any Senior Parent Finance Document and any Permitted Parent Financing Document by the
operation of the provisions set out under each section above under the caption “Restrictions
_Relating to Senior Parent Creditors and Senior Parent Liabilities” even if its obligation to make_
such payment is restricted at any time by the terms of any of those provisions.

The accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with any Senior Parent

Finance Document and any Permitted Parent Financing Document shall continue notwithstanding
the issue of a Super Senior/ Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop_

If:

(a) at any time following the issue of a Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent
Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Super Senior Payment Default or a Senior
Payment Default, that Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop


-----

Notice ceases to be outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Super Senior Payment
Default or Senior Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and

(b) the relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer or the relevant Debtor then promptly pays to the
Senior Parent Creditors an amount equal to any payments which had accrued under any
Senior Parent Finance Document or any Permitted Parent Financing Document and which
would have been Permitted Senior Parent Payments but for that Super

Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice, a Super Senior Payment
Default or Senior Payment Default, then any event or circumstance specified to be an
“Event of Default” in any of the Debt Financing Agreements (an “Event of Default”)
(including any cross default or similar provision under any other debt document) which
may have occurred as a result of that suspension of payments shall be waived, and any
Senior Parent Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that Event of
Default shall be waived, in each case without any further action being required on the part
of the Senior Parent Creditors or any other Creditor or Operating Facility Lender.

_Restrictions on Amendments and Waivers_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Senior Parent Creditors, the Senior Parent

Debt Issuer and the Debtors may amend or waive the terms of the Senior Parent Notes Finance
Documents and/or the Permitted Parent Financing Documents in accordance with their terms at
any time (and subject only to any consent required under them).

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Senior Parent Creditors_

Until the Primary Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an

Instructing Group:

(a) no Senior Parent Creditor shall direct the Security Agent to enforce, or otherwise require
the enforcement of any security; and

(b) no Senior Parent Creditor shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action in
relation to the guarantees by a member of the Group of any of the obligations of a Senior
Parent Debt Issuer under the Senior Parent Notes Finance Documents and/or Permitted
Parent Financing Documents,

except as permitted under the provisions set out below under the caption “Permitted Senior
_Parent Enforcement” provided, however, that no such action required by the Security Agent need_
be taken except to the extent the Security Agent otherwise is entitled under the Intercreditor
Agreement to direct such action.

_Option to Purchase: Senior Parent Creditors_

Subject to the following paragraphs, any of the Senior Parent Agents (on behalf of the

Senior Parent Creditors) may, after a Revolving Acceleration Event, a Senior Acceleration Event
or a Permitted Second Lien Financing Acceleration Event, by giving not less than 10 days’ notice
to the Security Agent, require the transfer to the Senior Parent Creditors of all, but not part, of the


-----

rights, benefits and obligations in respect of the Revolving Liabilities, the Senior Liabilities, the
Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities and the Operating Facility Liabilities if:

(a) that transfer is lawful and, subject to paragraph (b) below, otherwise permitted by the terms
of the New Revolving Facility Agreement (in the case of the Revolving Liabilities), the
relevant Senior Debt Documents (in the case of the Senior Liabilities), the relevant
Permitted Second Lien Financing Documents (in the case of the Permitted Second Lien
Financing Liabilities) and/or any Operating Facility Documents (in the case of the
Operating Facility Liabilities) (as applicable);

(b) any conditions relating to such a transfer contained in the New Revolving Facility
Agreement (in the case of the Revolving Liabilities), the relevant Senior Debt Documents
(in the case of the Senior Liabilities), the relevant Permitted Second Lien Financing
Documents (in the case of the Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities) and/or any
Operating Facility Documents (in the case of the Operating Facility Liabilities) are
complied with, in each case, other than as specified in the Intercreditor Agreement;

(c) each of the Revolving Agent (on behalf of the Revolving Lenders), the relevant Senior
Agent (on behalf of the relevant Senior Notes Creditors and the Permitted Senior Financing
Creditors), is paid the amounts required under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(d) the Operating Facility Lenders are paid the amounts required under the Intercreditor
Agreement;

(e) as a result of that transfer the Revolving Lenders, the Senior Notes Creditors, the Permitted
Senior Financing Creditors, the Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors and the
Operating Facility Lenders have no further actual or contingent liability to the Parent or
any other Debtor under the relevant Secured Debt Documents;

(f) an indemnity is provided from each Senior Parent Creditor (other than any Senior Parent
Agent) (or from another third party acceptable to the relevant creditors) in a form
reasonably satisfactory to each Senior Secured Creditor in respect of all costs, expenses,
losses and liabilities which may be sustained or incurred by any Revolving Lender, Senior
Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing Creditor, Permitted Second Lien Financing
Creditor or Operating Facility Lender in consequence of any sum received or recovered by
any such party from any person being required (or it being alleged that it is required) to be
paid back by or clawed back from any Revolving Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted
Senior Financing Creditor, Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditor or Operating Facility
Lender for any reason; and

(g) the transfer is made without recourse to, or representation or warranty from, any Revolving
Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing Creditor, Permitted Second
Lien Financing Creditor or Operating Facility Lender, except that each of them shall be
deemed to have represented and warranted on the date of that transfer that it has the
corporate power to effect that transfer and it has taken all necessary action to authorize the
making by it of that transfer.


-----

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, a Senior Parent Agent (on behalf of all the Senior

Parent Creditors) may only require a Super Senior Liabilities Transfer and a Senior Liabilities
Transfer if, at the same time, they require a transfer of hedging liabilities regulated by the
Intercreditor Agreement and if, for any reason, such transfer cannot be made in accordance with
the Intercreditor Agreement, no Super Senior Liabilities Transfer or Senior Liabilities Transfer
may be required to be made.

At the request of a Senior Parent Agent (on behalf of all the Senior Parent Creditors), the

relevant Senior Agent, the Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representative and the Operating
Facility Lenders shall notify the Senior Parent Agents of the foregoing payable sums in connection
with such transfer.

_Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement_

The restrictions set out in the caption “Restrictions on Enforcement by Senior Parent

_Creditors” above will not apply if:_

(a) a Senior Parent Event of Default (the “Relevant Senior Parent Default”) is continuing;

(b) the Revolving Agent and each Senior Agent has received a notice of the Relevant Senior
Parent Default specifying the event or circumstance in relation to the Relevant Senior
Parent Default from the Senior Parent Notes Trustee or the Senior Parent Creditor
Representative, as the case may be;

(c) a Senior Parent Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(d) the Relevant Senior Parent Default is continuing at the end of the relevant Senior Parent
Standstill Period.

Promptly upon becoming aware of a Senior Parent Event of Default, the Senior Parent

Notes Trustee or the Senior Parent Creditor Representative, as the case may be, may by notice (a
“Senior Parent Enforcement Notice”) in writing notify the Revolving Agent and each Senior Agent
of the existence of such Senior Parent Event of Default.

_Senior Parent Standstill Period_

In relation to a Relevant Senior Parent Default, a Senior Parent Standstill Period shall mean

the period beginning on the date (the “Senior Parent Standstill Start Date”) the relevant Senior
Parent Notes Trustee or the Senior Parent Creditor Representative, as the case may be, serves a
Senior Parent Enforcement Notice on each of the Revolving Agent and the Senior Agents in
respect of such Relevant Senior Parent Default and ending on the earlier to occur of:

(a) the date falling 179 days after the Senior Parent Standstill Start Date;

(b) the date the Primary Secured Parties take any Enforcement Action in relation to a particular
guarantor of the Senior Parent Notes and any Permitted Parent Financing Debt (a “Senior
_Parent Guarantor”); provided, however, that if a Senior Parent Standstill Period ends_
pursuant to this paragraph, the Senior Parent Finance Parties may only take the same


-----

Enforcement Action in relation to the Senior Parent Guarantor as the Enforcement Action
taken by the Primary Secured Parties against such Senior Parent Guarantor and not against
any other member of the Group;

(c) the date of an Insolvency Event in relation to the relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer or a
particular Senior Parent Guarantor against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken;

(d) the expiry of any other Senior Parent Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first
mentioned Senior Parent Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a result
of a cure, waiver or other permitted remedy);

(e) the date on which the consent of each of the Revolving Agent (acting pursuant to a
Required Super Senior Consent), the Senior Agent (acting pursuant to a Required Senior
Consent) and any Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representative (acting pursuant to a
Required Second Lien Consent) has been obtained; and

(f) a failure to pay the principal amount outstanding under the Senior Parent Notes or on any
Permitted Parent Financing Debt, as the case may be, at the final stated maturity of the
amounts outstanding under the Senior Parent Notes or on the Permitted Parent Financing
Debt, as the case may be (provided that (i) unless the Super Senior Discharge Date has
occurred or is otherwise agreed pursuant to a Required Super Senior Consent and agreed
by the Parent, such final stated maturity does not fall on a date prior to the date falling 85
months after the date of first utilization under the New Revolving Facility Agreement, (ii)
unless the Senior Discharge Date has occurred or is otherwise agreed pursuant to a
Required Senior Consent and agreed by the Parent, such final stated maturity does not fall
on a date prior to the date falling 85 months after the after the date of first utilization of any
indebtedness under the Senior Debt Documents, and (iii) unless the Permitted Second Lien
Financing Discharge Date has occurred or is otherwise agreed pursuant to a Required
Second Lien Consent and agreed by the Parent, such final stated maturity does not fall on
a date prior to the date falling 97 months after the date of first utilization of any
indebtedness under the Permitted Second Lien Financing Documents),

(the “Senior Parent Standstill Period”).

_Subsequent Senior Parent Notes Default_

The Senior Parent Finance Parties may take Enforcement Action under the provisions set

out in caption “Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement” above in relation to a Relevant Senior
Parent Default even if, at the end of any relevant Senior Parent Standstill Period or at any later
time, a further Senior Parent Standstill Period has begun as a result of any other Senior Parent
Event of Default.

_Enforcement on Behalf of Senior Parent Creditors_

If the Security Agent has notified each of the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior

Parent Creditor Representative (collectively, the “Senior Parent Agents” and each, a “Senior
_Parent Agent”) that it is enforcing security created pursuant to any security document over shares_
of a Senior Parent Guarantor, no Senior Parent Creditor may take any action referred to under the


-----

provisions set out under the caption “Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement” above against that
Senior Parent Guarantor while the Security Agent is taking steps to enforce that security in
accordance with the instructions of an Instructing Group where such action might be reasonably
likely to adversely affect such enforcement or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom.

**_Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, among other things, after the occurrence of an

Insolvency Event in relation to any Debtor, or, following an acceleration event which is continuing,
any member of the Group, any party entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of that
member of the Group in respect of liabilities owed to that party shall (in the case of any creditor
or Operating Facility Lender, only to the extent that such distribution would otherwise constitute
a receipt or recovery of a type subject to the provisions set out under the caption “Turnover by
_the Creditors” and, in all cases, if prior to a distress event, only if required by the Security Agent_
acting on the instructions of an Instructing Group), subject to receiving payment instructions and
any other relevant information from the Security Agent and to the extent it is able to do so, direct
the person responsible for the distribution of the assets of that member of the Group to pay that
distribution to the Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the Secured Parties have been paid
in full. In this respect, the Security Agent shall apply distributions paid to it in accordance with the
provisions set out under the caption “Application of Proceeds.”

Subject to certain exceptions, to the extent that any member of the Group’s liabilities are

discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event
in relation to that member of the Group, any creditor and any Operating Facility Lender which
benefited from that set-off shall (in the case of any creditor or Operating Facility Lender, only to
the extent that the relevant discharge constitutes a receipt or recovery of a type subject to the
provisions set out under the caption “Turnover by the Creditors” and, in all cases, if prior to a
distress event, only if required by the Security Agent acting on the instructions of an Instructing
Group), subject to receiving payment instructions and any other relevant information from the
Security Agent, pay an amount equal to the amount of the liabilities owed to it which are
discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions
set out under the caption “Application of Proceeds” and subject to certain exceptions.

Subject to the provisions set out under the caption “Application of Proceeds,” if the

Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in
respect of any of the liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and
except to the extent that the realization proceeds are actually applied towards the liabilities.

After the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to any Debtor or, following an

acceleration event which is continuing, any member of the Group, each creditor and each
Operating Facility Lender irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent, on its behalf, to:

(a) take any Enforcement Action (in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement)
against that member of the Group;

(b) demand, sue, prove and give receipt for any or all of that member of the Group’s liabilities;


-----

(c) collect and receive all distributions on, or on account of, any or all of that member of the
Group’s liabilities; and

(d) file claims, take proceedings and do all other things the Security Agent considers
reasonably necessary to recover that member of the Group’s liabilities.

Each creditor and Operating Facility Lender will (i) do all things that the Security Agent

reasonably requests in order to give effect to the matters referred to in this “Effect of Insolvency
_Event; Filing of Claims” section and (ii) if the Security Agent is not entitled to take any of the_
actions contemplated by this “Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims” section or if the
Security Agent requests that a creditor or an Operating Facility Lender take that action, undertake
that action itself in accordance with the instructions of the Security Agent or grant a power of
attorney to the Security Agent (on such terms as the Security Agent may reasonably require,
although a Senior Notes Trustee, a Permitted Second Lien Notes Trustee and the Senior Parent
Notes Trustee shall be under no obligation to grant such powers of attorney) to enable the Security
Agent to take such action.

**_Turnover by the Creditors_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that if at any time prior

to the Final Discharge Date, any Creditor or Operating Facility Lender receives or recovers from
any member of the Group:

(a) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, (i) any of the liabilities
which is prohibited by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, or (ii) following the
occurrence of the relevant distress event which is continuing, any Super Senior Liabilities,
Senior Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities or Operating Facility Liabilities;

(b) other than as referred to in the second paragraph under the caption “Effect of Insolvency
_Event; Filing of Claims” any amount by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities_
owed to it which does not give effect to a payment permitted under the Intercreditor
Agreement;

(c) any amount:

(i) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities after the occurrence of a distress
event including as a result of any litigation or proceedings against a member of the
Group other than after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that
member of the Group; or

(ii) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence
of a distress event,

other than, in each case, (A) any amount received or recovered in accordance with the
provisions set out below under the caption “-Application of Proceeds;” and (B) in the case
of intra-Group liabilities, any amount received or recovered in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement regulating the intra-Group lender and intra

-----

Group liabilities (to the extent permitted to be received or recovered notwithstanding that
an acceleration event is continuing);

(d) the proceeds of any enforcement of any security in accordance with the provisions set out
below in the caption “Application of Proceeds;” or

(e) subject to certain exceptions, any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on
account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed by any member of Group which is
not in accordance with the provisions set out in the caption “Application of Proceeds”
and which is made as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect
of that member of the Group,

that Creditor or Operating Facility Lender will (in the case of any receipts and recoveries referred
to in paragraph (e) above, if a distress event has not occurred, only if required by the Security
Agent acting on the instructions of an Instructing Group), subject to certain exceptions: (i) in
relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an amount
of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received or
recovered) on trust for the Security Agent and subject to receiving payment instructions and any
other relevant information from the Security Agent, promptly pay that amount to the Security
Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and (y) subject
to receiving payment instructions and any other relevant information from the Security Agent,
promptly pay an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the
relevant liabilities to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement; and (ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by
way of set-off, subject to receiving payment instructions and any other relevant information from
the Security Agent, promptly pay an amount equal to that receipt or recovery to the Security Agent
for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Enforcement of Security_**

_Enforcement Instructions_

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the security unless instructed otherwise by

(i) an Instructing Group; (ii) if required as set out under the third paragraph of this section, the
Majority Second Lien Creditors; or (iii) if required as set out under the third paragraph of this
section, the Majority Senior Parent Creditors.

Subject to the security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms (i) an

Instructing Group; (ii) to the extent permitted to enforce or to require the enforcement of the
security prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Discharge Date as described
under the caption “Restrictions Relating to Second Lien Creditors and Permitted Second Lien
_Financing Liabilities” above, the Majority Second Lien Creditors or (iii) to the extent permitted to_
enforce or to require the enforcement of the security prior to the Senior Discharge Date as
described under the caption “Restrictions Relating to Senior Parent Creditors and Senior Parent
_Liabilities” above, the Majority Senior Parent Creditors, may give or refrain from giving,_
instructions to the Security Agent to enforce, or refrain from enforcing, the security as they see fit.


-----

Prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Discharge Date, (i) if an Instructing

Group has instructed the Security Agent not to enforce or to cease enforcing the security or (ii) in
the absence of instructions from an Instructing Group, and, in each case, an Instructing Group has
not required any Debtor to make a Distressed Disposal, the Security Agent shall give effect to any
instructions to enforce the security which the Majority Second Lien Creditors are then entitled to
give to the Security Agent as described under the caption “Restrictions Relating to Second Lien
_Creditors and Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities” above._

Prior to the Primary Discharge Date, (i) if an Instructing Group has instructed the Security

Agent not to enforce or to cease enforcing the security or (ii) in the absence of instructions from
an Instructing Group, and, in each case, an Instructing Group has not required any Debtor to make
a Distressed Disposal, the Security Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the
security which the Majority Senior Parent Creditors are then entitled to give to the Security Agent
as described under the caption “Restrictions Relating to Senior Parent Creditors and Senior
_Parent Liabilities” above._

Subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, no Secured Party shall have

any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to enforce, any security or to exercise any
rights or powers arising under the security documents except through the Security Agent.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the security is being enforced as set forth above under the caption “Enforcement

_Instructions,” the Security Agent shall enforce the security in such manner (including, without_
limitation, the selection of any administrator, examiner or equivalent officer of any Debtor to be
appointed by the Security Agent) as:

  - an Instructing Group;

  - prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Discharge Date, if (i) the Security
Agent has, pursuant to the third paragraph under the caption “-Enforcement of Security”
above, given effect to instructions given by the Majority Second Lien Creditors to enforce
the security; and (ii) an Instructing Group has not given instructions as to the manner of
enforcement of the security, the Majority Second Lien Creditors; or

  - prior to the Primary Discharge Date, if (i) the Security Agent has, pursuant to the third
paragraph under the caption “Enforcement of Security” above, given effect to
instructions given by the Majority Senior Parent Creditors to enforce the security; and (ii)
an Instructing Group has not given instructions as to the manner of enforcement of the
security, the Majority Senior Parent Creditors,

shall instruct or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (it being
understood that, absent such instructions, the Security Agent may elect to take no action).

_Exercise of Voting Rights_


-----

To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, each Creditor (other than any Senior

Notes Trustee, Permitted Second Lien Notes Trustee or Senior Parent Notes Trustee) and each
Operating Facility Lender agrees with the Security Agent that it will cast its vote in any proposal
put to the vote by, or under the supervision of, any judicial or supervisory authority in respect of
any insolvency, pre-insolvency or rehabilitation or similar proceedings relating to any member of
the Group as instructed by the Security Agent. The Security Agent shall give instructions for the
purposes of this paragraph as directed by an Instructing Group. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
party can exercise or require any other creditor or Operating Facility Lender under the Intercreditor
Agreement to exercise its power of voting or representation to waive, reduce, discharge, extend
the due date for payment or otherwise reschedule any of the liabilities owed to that creditor or
Operating Facility Lender.

_Waiver of Rights_

To the extent permitted under applicable law and subject to certain provisions of the

Intercreditor Agreement, each of the Secured Parties and the Debtors waives all rights it may
otherwise have to require that the security be enforced in any particular order or manner or at any
particular time, or that any sum received or recovered from any person, or by virtue of the
enforcement of any of the security or of any other security interest, which is capable of being
applied in or towards discharge of any of the secured obligations, is so applied.

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any security is held by a Creditor or Operating Facility Lender other than the Security

Agent, then that Creditor or Operating Facility Lender may only enforce that security in
accordance with instructions given by an Instructing Group pursuant to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement (and for this purpose references to the Security Agent shall be construed
as references to that creditor or Operating Facility Lender).

_Duties Owed_

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, each of the Secured Parties and the Debtors

acknowledges that, in the event that the Security Agent enforces, or is instructed to enforce, the
security prior to the Primary Discharge Date, the duties of the Security Agent and of any receiver
or delegate owed to any Senior Parent Creditors in respect of the method, type and timing of that
enforcement or of the exploitation, management or realization of any of that security shall be no
different to or greater than the duty that is owed by the Security Agent, receiver or delegate to the
Debtors under general law.

_Consultation Period_

(a) Subject to paragraph (d) below, before giving any instructions to the Security Agent to
enforce the security or refrain or cease from enforcing the security or to take any other
Enforcement Action, the creditor representative(s) of the creditors of the Group represented
in the Instructing Group concerned (and, if applicable, any relevant Hedge Counterparties)
shall consult with each other creditor representative of the Creditors of the Instructing
Group, each other Hedge Counterparty, each Operating Facility Lender and the Security
Agent in good faith about the instructions to be given by the Instructing Group for a period


-----

of not less than 10 business days (or, in the case of any consultation involving a Senior
Notes Trustee, a Senior Parent Notes Trustee or a creditor representative in respect of any
high-yield notes, debt securities or other similar instruments, 30 days) from the date on
which details of the proposed instructions are received by such creditor representative(s),
Hedge Counterparties, Operating Facility Lenders and the Security Agent (or such shorter
period as each creditor representative, Hedge Counterparty, Operating Facility Lender and
the Security Agent shall agree) (the “Consultation Period”), and only following the expiry
of a Consultation Period shall the Instructing Group be entitled to give any instructions to
the Security Agent to enforce the security or refrain or cease from enforcing the security
or take any other Enforcement Action.

(b) Subject to paragraph (c) below, in the event conflicting instructions are received from any
other Instructing Group, the Security Agent shall enforce the security, refrain or cease from
enforcing the security or, as the case may be, take the relevant other Enforcement Action
in accordance with the instructions given by an Instructing Group referred to in paragraph
(a)(i)(A) of the definition of Instructing Group as set out above (in each case, provided that
such instructions are consistent with any applicable requirements of the Intercreditor
Agreement and the security documents) and the terms of all instructions given by any other
Instructing Group shall be deemed revoked.

(c) Prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date, if:

(i) the Super Senior Secured Creditors have not been fully repaid within six months of
the end of the first Consultation Period;

(ii) the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement of the security (or a
transaction in lieu thereof) or other Enforcement Action within three months of the
end of the first Consultation Period; or

(iii) an Insolvency Event has occurred and the Security Agent has not commenced any
enforcement of the security (or a transaction in lieu thereof) or other Enforcement
Action at that time,

then the Security Agent shall follow the instructions given by the Majority Super Senior Creditors
(in each case provided that such instructions are consistent with any applicable requirements of
the Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant security documents).

(d) Subject to paragraph (c) above, no Agent or Hedge Counterparty shall be obliged to consult
in accordance with paragraph (a) above and an Instructing Group shall be entitled to give
any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the security or take any other Enforcement
Action prior to the end of a Consultation Period (in each case provided that such
instructions are consistent with any applicable requirements of the Intercreditor Agreement
and the security documents) if:

(i) the security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event; or

(ii) the Instructing Group or any creditor representative of the creditors represented in
the Instructing Group determines in good faith (and notifies each other creditor


-----

representative, the Hedge Counterparties and the Security Agent) that to enter into
such consultations and thereby delay the commencement of enforcement of the
security would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on:

(A) the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the security; or

(B) the realization proceeds of any enforcement of the security, and,

where this paragraph (d) applies:

(I) any instructions shall be limited to those necessary to protect or preserve the
interests of the Super Senior Creditors or Senior Secured Creditors (as applicable)
on behalf of which the relevant Instructing Group is acting in relation to the matters
referred to in sub-paragraphs (A) and (B) above; and

(II) the Security Agent shall act in accordance with the instructions first received.

**_Proceeds of Disposals_**

_Non-Distressed Disposals_

The Security Agent is irrevocably authorized and instructed (at the request and cost of the

relevant Debtor or the Parent) to promptly release (or procure that any other relevant person
releases):

(a) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any asset which is
the subject of:

(i) a disposal not prohibited by the terms of the New Revolving Facility Agreement,
any Senior Notes Indenture, any Permitted Senior Financing Agreement, any
Permitted Second Lien Financing Agreement, any Senior Parent Notes Indenture
and any Permitted Parent Financing Agreement (each a “Debt Financing
_Agreement”) (including a disposal to a member of the Group, but without prejudice_
to any obligation of any member of the Group in a Debt Financing Agreement to
provide replacement security); or

(ii) any other transaction not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing
Agreement pursuant to which that asset will cease to be held or owned by a
member of the Group;

(b) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any document or
agreement in order for any member of the Group to effect any amendment or waiver in
respect of that document or agreement or otherwise exercise any rights, comply with any
obligations or take any action in relation to that document or agreement (in each case to the
extent not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement);


-----

(c) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any asset of any
member of the Group which has ceased to be a Debtor or will cease to be a Debtor
simultaneously with such release; and

(d) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any other asset to the
extent that such release is in accordance with the terms of the Debt Financing Agreements.

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor (or any holding

company of any Debtor), or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor (or any holding
company of any Debtor) will cease to be a member of the Group or a Debtor (including in
connection with the resignation of that Debtor or the Debtor being designated as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary), the Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the Secured Parties) shall (at the request
and cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent) promptly release (or procure the release of) that
Debtor and its subsidiaries from all present and future liabilities under the Secured Debt
Documents and the respective assets of such Debtor and its subsidiaries from the security and the
Secured Debt Documents.

When making any request for a release pursuant to this “Non-Distressed Disposals”

section, the Parent shall confirm in writing to the Security Agent that:

(a) in the case of any release requested pursuant to paragraph (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above, the relevant
disposal or other action is not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement;
or

(b) in the case of any release requested pursuant to paragraph (d) above, the relevant release is
in accordance with terms of the Debt Financing Agreements;

and the Security Agent shall be entitled to rely on that confirmation for all purposes under the
Secured Debt Documents.

The Security Agent shall (at the cost and expense of the relevant Debtor or the Parent but

without the need for any further consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any
creditor, Operating Facility Lender, other Secured Party or Debtor) promptly enter into such
documentation and/or take such other action as the Parent (acting reasonably) shall require to give
effect to any release or other matter described in the paragraph above.

If any member of the Group is required or permitted under the Revolving Finance

Documents or the Senior Debt Documents to apply the proceeds of any disposal or other
transaction in prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or reduction of any Super Senior
Liabilities or Senior Liabilities (as applicable) then no such application of those proceeds shall
require the consent of any other party or result in any breach of any Senior Parent Notes Finance
Documents or Permitted Parent Financing Documents and any such application shall discharge in
full any obligation to apply those proceeds in prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or
reduction of any Senior Parent Liabilities. This paragraph is without prejudice to any right of any
member of the Group to apply any proceeds of any disposal or other transaction in prepayment,
redemption or any other discharge or reduction of any Senior Parent Liabilities to the extent
permitted or contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement or any other Senior Debt Document.


-----

The Security Agent is irrevocably authorized by each Secured Party to (and will on the

request and at the cost of the Parent):

(i) release the security; and

(ii) release each investor, each Debtor and each other member of the Group from all liabilities,
undertakings and other obligations under the Secured Debt Documents,

on the Final Discharge Date (or at any time following such date on the request of the Parent).

_Distressed Disposals_

Generally, a “Distressed Disposal” is a disposal of an asset of a member of the Group

which is (a) being effected at the request of an Instructing Group in circumstances where a security
interest has become enforceable in accordance with the terms of the relevant security document(s),
(b) being effected by enforcement of a security interest in accordance with the terms of the relevant
security document(s) or (c) being disposed of to a third-party subsequent to a distress event.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset of a member of the Group is being effected, the

Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent and
without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor, Operating
Facility Lender, other Secured Party or Debtor):

(a) to release the security interest or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver or
enter into any release of that security interest or claim and issue any letters of noncrystallization of any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion
of the Security Agent, be considered necessary or desirable;

(b) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor, to release:

(i) that Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing
liabilities, its guarantee liabilities and its other liabilities;

(ii) any security interest granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over
any of its assets; and

(iii) any other claim of an investor, an intra-Group lender, or another Debtor over that
Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor,

on behalf of the relevant creditors, Operating Facility Lenders, Debtors and certain creditor
representatives;

(c) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company
of a Debtor, to release:

(i) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any
part of its borrowing liabilities, its guarantees liabilities and its other liabilities;


-----

(ii) any security interest granted by that holding company or any subsidiary of that
holding company over any of its assets; and

(iii) any other claim of any investor, any intra-Group lender or another Debtor over that
holding company’s assets or the assets of any subsidiary of that holding company,

on behalf of the relevant creditors, Operating Facility Lenders, Debtors and certain creditor
representatives;

(d) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities or the Debtor liabilities
owed by that Debtor or holding company or any subsidiary of that Debtor or holding
company:

(i) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does
not intend that any transferee of those liabilities or Debtor liabilities (the
“Transferee”) will be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the
purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement), to execute and deliver or enter into any
agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities or Debtor liabilities; provided
that, notwithstanding any other provision of any debt document, the Transferee
shall not be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement; and

(ii) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does
intend that any Transferee will be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party
for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement), to execute and deliver or enter
into any agreement to dispose of:

(A) all (and not part only) of the liabilities owed to the Primary Creditors and
the Operating Facility Lenders; and

(B) all or part of any other liabilities and the Debtor liabilities,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors, Operating Facility Lenders and Debtors;

(e) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving
_Entity”) all or any part of the Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of any_
subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of the intra-Group liabilities or the Debtor
liabilities, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to:

(A) agree to the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-Group
liabilities or Debtor liabilities on behalf of the relevant intra-Group lenders and
Debtors to which those obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which
owe those obligations; and


-----

(B) (if the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also
a guarantor of Super Senior Liabilities or Senior Liabilities) to accept the transfer
of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-Group liabilities or Debtor
liabilities on behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which the
obligations in respect of those intra-Group liabilities or Debtor liabilities are to be
transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of
liabilities or Debtor liabilities) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “Application of Proceeds” (to
the extent that the asset disposed of constituted secured assets) as if those proceeds were
the proceeds of an enforcement of the relevant security interest and, to the extent that any
disposal of liabilities or Debtor liabilities has occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities or
Debtor liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal effected by, or at the request of, the Security Agent

(acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), the Security Agent shall take reasonable
care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions (though the Security Agent
shall not have any obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in
order to achieve a higher price).

Where borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities and/or other liabilities in relation to a

member of the Group would otherwise be released pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Creditor or Operating Facility Lender concerned may elect to have those
borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities and/or, as the case may be, other liabilities transferred
to the Parent in which case the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (to the extent legally
possible and at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent and without any consent, sanction,
authority or further confirmation from any creditor, Operating Facility Lender, other Secured Party
or Debtor) to execute such documents as are required to so transfer those liabilities.

Subject to the immediately following paragraph, in the case of a Distressed Disposal

effected by or at the request of the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement), unless the consent of each Senior Agent is otherwise obtained, it is a further condition
to any release, transfer or disposal that the proceeds of such disposal are in cash (or substantially
all in cash) and such sale or disposal is made pursuant to a “public auction” in respect of which
the Primary Creditors are entitled to participate or, in circumstances where the Security Agent
(acting in good faith) considers that a public auction is not reasonably practicable taking into
account all relevant circumstances or following an attempted public auction the Primary Creditors
(other than the Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors and the Senior Parent Creditors) make
the highest final binding offer of all the offers received but that offer is less than the aggregate par
value of the Primary Liabilities (other than the Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities and
the Senior Parent Liabilities), an independent financial adviser has delivered an opinion in respect
of such sale or disposal that the amount received in connection therewith is fair from a financial
point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances, including the method of enforcement,
provided that the liability of such financial adviser may be limited to the amount of its fees in
respect of such engagement (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent shall have no


-----

obligation to select or engage any financial adviser unless it shall have been indemnified and/or
secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

If prior to the Permitted Second Lien Financing Discharge Date a Distressed Disposal is

being effected such that, generally, any Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities will be
released or disposed of or any security securing the Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities
will be released, it is a further condition to the release that either:

  - each Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representative has approved the release; or

  - where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor in respect of the Permitted Second
Lien Financing Liabilities are sold:

(a) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash);

(b) all claims of the Super Senior Secured Creditors, the Senior Secured Creditors, the
Senior Notes Creditors, the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors and the Operating
Facility Lenders (other than in relation to performance bonds or guarantees or

(other than any minority interest not owned by members of the Group) or assets are
sold or disposed of pursuant to such Enforcement Action, are unconditionally
released and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and are
not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all security interests under
the security documents in respect of the shares or assets that are sold or disposed of
is simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with
such sale; provided that, if each of the Revolving Agent, any Senior Notes Trustee
and any relevant senior secured creditor representative (acting reasonably and in
good faith):

(i) determines that the Super Senior Secured Creditors or the Senior Secured
Creditors (as applicable) will recover a greater amount if such claim is sold
or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or one of its affiliates and not
released or discharged; and

(ii) serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming the same,

the Security Agent shall be entitled to sell or otherwise transfer such claim to the
purchaser or one of its affiliates; and

(c) such sale or disposal is made:

entitled to participate; or

(ii) in circumstances where the Security Agent (acting in good faith) considers
that a public auction is not reasonably practicable taking into account all
relevant circumstances or following an attempted public auction the
Primary Creditors (other than the Permitted Second Lien Financing


-----

offer of all the offers received but that offer is less than the aggregate par

financial adviser has delivered an opinion in respect of such sale or disposal,
that the amount received in connection therewith, generally, is fair from a
financial point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances,

financial adviser may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such
engagement (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent shall have no
obligation to select or engage any financial adviser unless it shall have been
indemnified and/ or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

If prior to the Senior Parent Discharge Date a Distressed Disposal is being effected such

that, generally, the guarantees of the Senior Parent Notes and the guarantees of any Permitted
Parent Financing Debt or any security over the assets of a Senior Parent Debt Issuer or any Senior
Parent Guarantor will be released and/or the Senior Parent Notes Liabilities and any Permitted
Parent Financing Liabilities will be released or disposed of, it is a further condition to the release
that either:

  - the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent Creditor Representative has
approved the release; or

  - where shares or assets of a Senior Parent Guarantor or assets of a Senior Parent Debt Issuer
are sold:

(a) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash); and

(b) all claims of the Super Senior Secured Creditors, Senior Secured Creditors and the
Operating Facility Lenders (other than in relation to performance bonds or
guarantees or similar instruments) against a member of the Group (if any), all of

Creditors (as applicable) will recover a greater amount if such claim is sold
or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or one of its affiliates and not

connection therewith, generally, is fair from a financial point of view taking
into account all relevant circumstances, including the method of
enforcement, provided that the liability of such financial adviser may be

The Intercreditor Agreement additionally provides for Hedge Counterparties and

Operating Facility Lenders (each as defined above) to receive guarantees and indemnities from the
Debtors on substantially the same terms (including the relevant limitations) as such guarantees and
indemnities are provided by the obligors to the finance parties under the New Revolving Facility
Agreement.

**_Exceptions_**

Subject to the following paragraphs of this “Exceptions” section, an amendment, waiver

or consent which adversely relates to the express rights or obligations of an agent, an arranger or
the Security Agent (in each case in such capacity) may not be effected without the consent of that
agent, that arranger or the Security Agent (as the case may be) at such time.

The foregoing shall not apply:

  - to any release of security, claim or liabilities; or

  - to any consent,

which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in accordance with the provisions set out in the
caption “Proceeds of Disposals” above.

The first paragraph of this “Exceptions” section shall apply to an arranger only to the

extent that the arranger liabilities are then owed to that arranger.

**_Agreement to Override_**


-----

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor

Agreement overrides anything in the debt documents to the contrary.

**Meridian indebtedness**

Following the Transactions, Meridian Spa & Fitness Deutschland GmbH and its

subsidiaries will have £3 million of unsecured, deeply subordinated notes outstanding (the
“Meridian Notes”). The Meridian Notes were issued by Meridian Mezzanine GmbH, rank behind
all of this entity’s other present and future creditors and rank equally to claims of shareholders on
repayment of equity contribution, are redeemable at the end of each calendar year with 6 months’
notice, are covenant-light and have an indefinite term.

**PIK Instrument**

In connection with the Transactions, on or about the Issue Date, HoldCo will issue a £250

million pay-in-kind term loan, denominated in GBP. The PIK Instrument will mature seven years
after the Issue Date, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased and cancelled in accordance with the
facility agreement governing the PIK Instrument. The PIK Instrument has no recourse to the
Restricted Group.

Interest on the PIK Instrument is capitalized annually if the borrower does not elect to pay

in cash. The PIK Instrument is not guaranteed but is secured by a share pledge over the direct
subsidiary of the borrower, Deuce ParentCo Limited. The PIK Instrument is a senior obligation of
HoldCo and is structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of the subsidiaries of
HoldCo, including the Notes offered hereby. The facility agreement governing the PIK Instrument
contains certain restrictive covenants, which, subject to certain exceptions, are substantially similar
to the covenants governing the Notes, which are set forth under “Description of the Notes.”

**Description of the Notes**

Deuce FinCo plc (the “Issuer”) will issue and the Guarantors (as defined herein) will

guarantee €300,000,000 senior secured floating rate notes due 2027 (the “Euro Notes”) and
£645,000,000     % senior secured notes due 2027 (the “Sterling Notes” and, together with the
Euro Notes, the “Notes”) in this Offering. The Issuer is a public limited company incorporated
under the laws of England and Wales, which has been organized as a special purpose finance
subsidiary of Deuce MidCo Limited (the “Parent”), a private limited company incorporated under
the laws of England and Wales, to facilitate the offering of debt securities and which has no
operations and no assets other than its rights under the Proceeds Loan Agreement pursuant to
which it on-lends the proceeds of the Offering to the Parent. The Issuer will be dependent on
payments on the Proceeds Loan (as defined herein) in order to service the Notes.

The proceeds of the Notes, together with the proceeds from certain other equity financing

transactions described herein, will be used (i) to repay existing indebtedness, (ii) for general
corporate purposes, including working capital requirements, capital expenditures and strategic
acquisitions, and (iii) to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Offering. See “Use
_of proceeds.”_

In this “Description of the Notes,” the “Parent” refers only to Deuce MidCo Limited, the

parent of the Issuer, and any successor obligor to Deuce MidCo Limited on the Parent Guarantee
(as defined herein), and not to any of its subsidiaries, including the Issuer; and the “Issuer” refers
only to Deuce FinCo plc, and any successor obligor to Deuce FinCo plc on the Notes.

The Issuer will issue the Notes under an indenture to be dated as of the Issue Date (the

“Indenture”) among, inter alios, the Issuer, Deuce ParentCo Limited (“TopCo”), the Guarantors
(as defined herein) and GLAS Trust Company LLC, as trustee (the “Trustee”). The Notes will be
issued in private transactions that are not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities
Act (as defined herein). See “Transfer restrictions.” The terms of the Notes include those stated in
the Indenture. The Indenture will not be qualified under, incorporate provisions by reference to, or
otherwise be subject to, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

The Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees (as defined herein) will be subject to the

terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein) and any additional intercreditor
agreements entered into in the future. The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to
understand the terms and ranking of the Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes and the Note
Guarantees. See “Description of other financial arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a
description of the material terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

This “Description of the Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of

the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Proceeds Loan Agreement. Since this
description of the terms of the Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Indenture for
complete descriptions of the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors and your rights. Copies
of the Indenture, the form of Notes and the Intercreditor Agreement will be available as set forth
under “Where you can find more information.”

**Summary Description of the Notes**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will:

    - be senior obligations of the Issuer;

    - be secured by the Collateral described below along with obligations of the Issuer
under the Revolving Facilities Agreement, Hedging Obligations and any Operating
Facility (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) (although any liabilities in respect
of obligations under the Revolving Facilities Agreement and certain Hedging
Obligations that are secured by the Collateral will receive priority over the Holders
with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over the
Collateral);

    - rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s existing and future
Indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

    - be senior to all of the Issuer’s existing and future Subordinated Indebtedness (as
defined herein);

    - be effectively senior to all of the Issuer’s existing and future unsecured indebtedness
to the extent of the value of the Collateral that is available to satisfy the obligations

    - be guaranteed by the Guarantors on a joint and several basis, subject to the guarantee
limitations described herein.

**Principal and Maturity**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue €300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Euro

Notes and £645,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Sterling Notes. The Notes will mature
on         , 2027. The Euro Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and
in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Sterling Notes will be issued in minimum
denominations of £100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof. The rights of
holders of beneficial interests in the Notes to receive the payments on such Notes are subject to
applicable procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day, the Holder

thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day,
and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.


-----

**Interest**

**_Euro Notes_**

Interest on the Euro Notes will accrue at a rate per annum computed against the principal

outstanding on the Euro Notes (the “Applicable Rate”), reset quarterly, equal to three-month
EURIBOR (with a 0% floor), plus   %, as determined by the calculation agent (the “Calculation
_Agent”), which shall initially be Global Loan Agency Services Limited._

Interest on the Euro Notes will be payable in cash quarterly in arrears on  ,  ,   and

of each year, commencing on , 2021, to Holders of record on the immediately preceding Business
Day. Interest on the Euro Notes will accrue from the Issue date or, if interest has already been paid,
from the date it was most recently paid.

If the interest payment date in respect of any Euro Notes is not a Business Day, the Holder

thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day,
and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. London time, on each

Determination Date, determine the Applicable Rate, and calculate the aggregate amount of interest
payable on the Euro Notes in respect of the following Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The
Interest Amount will be calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal amount of
Euro Notes outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying such amount by
the actual number of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360.

All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary,

to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one millionths of a
percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g. 4.876545% (or 0.04876545) being rounded to
4.87655% (or 0.0487655)). All euro amounts used in or resulting from calculations will be rounded
to the nearest euro cent (with one half euro cent being rounded upwards). The determination of the
Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful
default, bad faith or manifest error, be binding on all parties. The Trustee and the Paying Agent
shall not be responsible for, nor incur any liability in connection with, any loss resulting from any
calculation made, or intended to be made, by the Calculation Agent.

The Calculation Agent will, upon the written request of the holder of any Euro Notes,

provide the interest rate then in effect with respect to the Euro Notes. The rights of holders of
beneficial interests in the Euro Notes to receive the payments of interest on the Euro Notes will be
subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable.

Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days

elapsed. The Applicable Rate on the Euro Notes will in no event be higher than the maximum rate
permitted by applicable law.

Set forth below is a summary of certain defined terms used in the Indenture relating to the

calculation of interest on the Euro Notes.


-----

“Determination Date,” with respect to an Interest Period, will be the day that is two

TARGET Settlement Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period, except that the initial
determination date shall be  , 2021.

“EURIBOR,” with respect to an Interest Period, will be the rate (expressed as a percentage

per annum) for deposits in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET
Settlement Days after the Determination Date that appears on page EURIBOR01 of the Thomson
Reuters screen (or any replacement Thomson Reuters page which displays that rate), as of 11:00
a.m. Brussels time, on the Determination Date. Unless the immediately following paragraph
applies, if such Thomson Reuters page does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a
Determination Date, the Issuer will request the principal office of each of four major banks in the
euro zone interbank market, as selected by the Issuer in consultation with the Calculation Agent,
to provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of
approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the euro
zone interbank market for deposits in a Representative Amount in euro for a three-month period
beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at
least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the
arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Issuer
will request each of three major banks in London, as selected by the Issuer in consultation with the
Calculation Agent, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of
approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a
Representative Amount in euro to leading European banks for a three month period beginning on
the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such
rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If
fewer than two such rates are so provided then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in
effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period. In no event shall EURIBOR be
less than 0.00%.

In the event that EURIBOR is no longer being calculated or administered, is no longer

generally representative of the underlying market which EURIBOR seeks to represent on the Issue
Date or is otherwise no longer generally accepted in the euro zone for the purposes of determining
floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated securities, the rate of interest on the Euro
Notes will thereafter be determined on an alternative basis by reference to any successor rate
(including any generally accepted adjustment spread) generally accepted in the euro zone for the
purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated securities which
originally referenced EURIBOR, as identified by the Issuer in good faith; provided that, in the
event that there is no generally accepted successor rate to EURIBOR in the good faith judgment
of the Issuer, the Issuer, in consultation with an independent financial advisor, shall determine a
reasonably appropriate alternative basis for determining the rate of interest (and including any
applicable adjustment spread to reduce or eliminate, to the extent reasonably practicable in the
circumstances, any economic prejudice or benefit (as the case may be) to holders of the Euro Notes
as a result of the replacement of EURIBOR) on the Euro Notes; provided, however, that any such
alternative basis adopted pursuant to this paragraph shall in all cases not be less than 0.00%.
Following the adoption of an alternative basis pursuant to this paragraph, all references to
“EURIBOR” in the Indenture shall be deemed to refer to such alternative basis. The Issuer shall
promptly thereafter notify the holders on the Euro Notes and (by way of an Officer’s Certificate)
the Calculation Agent of the alternative basis for determining the rate of interest of the Euro Notes


-----

in place of EURIBOR, and the Calculation Agent shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s
Certificate (without further enquiry, investigation, verification or liability of any kind whatsoever)
as sufficient evidence thereof. Holders of the Euro Notes shall be bound by any such alternative
basis without any further action or consent by the holders of the Euro Notes or the Trustee. Under
the terms of the Indenture, the Trustee shall be permitted to agree, without consent of the Holders
of the Euro Notes, to make conforming changes to the provisions (as recommended or put forward
by an independent financial adviser) to reflect the mechanics for the determination of interest under
the chosen alternative basis.

“Thomson Reuters Page EURIBOR01” means the display page so designated on Thomson

Reuters (or such other page as may replace that page on that service, or, if no such page is available,
such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor).

“euro zone” means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that have

adopted the euro.

“Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date

and ending on and including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment
date, with the exception that the first Interest Period shall commence on the Issue Date and end on
and exclude  , 2021.

“Representative Amount” means the greater of (i) €1,000,000 and (ii) an amount that is

representative for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

“TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the TARGET (Trans-European

Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer system) is open.

**_Sterling Notes_**

Interest on the Sterling Notes will accrue at the rate of    % per annum on the principal

outstanding on the Sterling Notes. Interest on the Sterling Notes will be payable in cash, semiannually in arrears on          and         of each year, commencing on           ,
2021, to Holders of record on the immediately preceding Business Day. Interest on the Sterling
Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has
been paid, from the date of original issuance. Interest on the Sterling Notes will be computed on
the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Each interest period shall end on
(but not include) the relevant interest payment date.

If the interest payment date in respect of any Sterling Notes is not a Business Day, the

Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business
Day, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**Additional Notes**

From time to time, subject to the Parent’s compliance with the covenant described under

the heading “—Certain covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer is permitted to issue
additional Notes, which shall be subject to the provisions of the Indenture, except as otherwise


-----

specified in or consequent on the terms specified in an Officer’s Certificate provided by the Issuer
to the Trustee and the Paying Agent (“Additional Notes”). The Officer’s Certificate will set out:

(1) the title of such Additional Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes will be issued;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes
shall bear interest and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method
of determining such interest rate or rates, the date or dates from which such interest
shall accrue, the interest payment dates on which such interest shall be payable or
the method by which such dates will be determined, the record dates for the
determination of holders thereof to whom such interest is payable and the basis
upon which such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated
and the currency in which cash or government obligations in connection with such
series of Additional Notes may be payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which,
and the terms and conditions upon which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed,
in whole or in part;

(7) the denominations in which such Additional Notes shall be issued and redeemed;

(8) the ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification numbers with
respect to such Additional Notes; and

(9) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes shall mature.

Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this

“Description of the Notes,” references to (i) “Notes” shall be deemed to include references to the
Notes to be issued on the Issue Date as well as any Additional Notes, (ii) “Additional Notes” shall
be deemed to include references to Additional Euro Notes, Additional Sterling Notes and any other
Additional Notes issued under the Indenture, (iii) “Euro Notes” shall be deemed to include
references to the Euro Notes to be issued on the Issue Date as well as any Additional Euro Notes,
and (iv) “Sterling Notes” shall be deemed to include references to the Sterling Notes to be issued
on the Issue Date as well as any Additional Sterling Notes. Additional Notes shall be treated, along
with all other Notes, as a single class for the purposes of the Indenture with respect to waivers,
amendments and all other matters which are not specifically distinguished for such series. For all
purposes other than U.S. federal income tax purposes, Additional Notes shall be deemed to form
one series with any Notes previously issued if they have terms substantially identical in all material
respects to such other Notes. In the event that any Additional Notes sold pursuant to Rule 144A
are not fungible with any Notes previously issued for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such nonfungible Additional Notes shall be issued with a separate ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other
securities identification number, as applicable, so that they are distinguishable from such


-----

previously issued Notes. Additional Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S from time to time may
be issued with the same ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as
Notes belonging to the same series previously issued without being fungible with such series of
initial Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. **If you are a U.S. holder (as defined in**
**“Certain tax considerations—Certain United States federal income tax considerations”)**
**considering the purchase of Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S, you should consult your**
**tax advisors concerning the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences to you of the**
**purchase, ownership and disposition of such Notes, including with respect to the potential**
**issuance of Additional Notes that are not fungible with the applicable series of initial Notes**
**for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but which nevertheless are not capable of being**
**separately identified.**

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts (as defined under “—

_Additional Amounts”), if any, on the Global Notes (as defined under “—Transfer and Exchange”)_
will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents (as defined under
“—Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Notes”); provided that all such payments
with respect to Notes represented by one or more Global Notes registered in the name of or held
by a nominee of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, will be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account specified by the Holder or Holders thereof.

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated

securities (“Definitive Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one
or more Paying Agents maintained for such purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive
Registered Notes may be paid by wire transfer to the Person entitled thereto as shown on the
register for the Definitive Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent
_for the Notes.”_

**Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a “Paying Agent”) for the Notes

for so long as the Notes are held in registered form. The initial Paying Agent for the Notes will be
GLAS Trust Company LLC.

The Issuer will also maintain (i) one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar”) and (ii) a

transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The initial Registrar and Transfer Agent will be GLAS Trust
Company LLC. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of Definitive
Registered Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and the Paying Agent and the Transfer
Agent (as applicable) will make payments on and facilitate transfers of Definitive Registered Notes
on behalf of the Issuer. The Transfer Agent shall perform the functions of a transfer agent.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Calculation Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent

for the Notes without prior notice to the Holders. However, for so long as the Notes are listed on
the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”), and if and to the extent
that the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any change of


-----

Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying
Agent or Registrar in respect of the Notes.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will be issued in the form of one or more registered notes in global form without

interest coupons, as follows:

    - Each series of the Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers
pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or
more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A
_Global Notes”)._

    - The 144A Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with the common
depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for
the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

    - Each series of the Notes sold to persons who are not U.S. persons and are outside the
United States in offshore transactions pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities
Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together
with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”).

    - The Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with the
common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common
depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to

Persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or Persons that may hold interests
through such participants. Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof
will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and
described more fully under “Transfer restrictions.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests
between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules
and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and their respective
participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes may be transferred to a Person who takes

delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes only upon delivery
by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that
such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Prior to 40 days after the date of initial issuance of the Notes, ownership of Book-Entry

Interests in Regulation S Global Notes will be limited to Persons that have accounts with Euroclear
or Clearstream or Persons who hold interests through Euroclear or Clearstream, and any sale or
transfer of such interest to U.S. persons shall not be permitted during such period unless such resale
or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Subject to the foregoing,


-----

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form
of 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the
form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a Person who the
transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A
in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the
transfer restrictions described under “Transfer restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable
securities law of any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding

paragraphs will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it
was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was
transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer
restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to
which it was transferred.

In the event Additional Notes are issued pursuant to Regulation S that bear the same ISIN,

Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as Notes belonging to the same
series previously issued, without being fungible with such series of initial Notes for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes that form part of that
series, including in respect of investors that hold Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global
Notes on or prior to the date of issuance of such Additional Notes, will not be eligible for transfer
to Book-Entry Interests in a Rule 144A Global Note (if any) representing Notes of that same series.
See also “Risk factors—Risks related to our financial profile, the Notes and the Guarantees—
_Additional Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S may not be fungible with existing Notes for U.S._
_federal income tax purposes,” “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form—Transfers” and “—Additional_
_Notes.”_

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum

denominations of £100,000 or €100,000 aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of
£1,000 or €1,000 in excess thereof, as the case may be, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions
relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture.
It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests.
Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth
in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent
or the Issuer to be in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with
respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer
_restrictions.”_

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive

Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged in whole or in part, in minimum denominations
of £100,000 or €100,000 in aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of £1,000 or €1,000
in excess thereof, as the case may be. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the
Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish
appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of
the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, to furnish certain certificates and
opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or


-----

exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection
with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer will not be required to register the transfer or

exchange of any Definitive Registered Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of such Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of such
Notes to be redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment
date applicable to such Notes;

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection
with a Change of Control Offer (as defined under “—Change of Control”) or an
Asset Disposition Offer (as defined under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on
_sales of assets and Subsidiary stock”); or_

(5) to register the transfer of or to exchange a Note between a record date and the next
succeeding interest payment date.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent will be

entitled to treat the Holder as the owner of it for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

All the Parent’s Subsidiaries are Restricted Subsidiaries. In the circumstances described

below under the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the Parent will be permitted to designate
Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject
to any of the restrictive covenants contained in the Indenture.

**Note Guarantees**

No later than two business days from the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security

Principles, the obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Notes will be unconditionally guaranteed,
jointly and severally, by the Parent and by each existing material wholly owned Restricted
Subsidiary of the Parent, subject to certain exceptions (the “Note Guarantees” and each a “Note
_Guarantee”). Each Restricted Subsidiary that provides a guarantee of the Notes (a “Subsidiary_
_Note Guarantee”) is referred to herein as a “Subsidiary Guarantor,” and together with the Parent_
as the “Guarantors.” The initial Guarantors will consist of the Parent, David Lloyd Leisure
Limited, David Lloyd Leisure GR Limited, David Lloyd Clubs Limited, Deuce Acquisitions
Limited, David Lloyd Leisure Operations Holdings Limited, David Lloyd Leisure Group Limited,
David Lloyd Clubs Holdings Limited and David Lloyd Leisure Properties No. 3 Limited (the
“Initial Guarantors”).The Initial Guarantors will include each entity that will guarantee the
Revolving Facilities Agreement (in addition to the Issuer) on or about the Issue Date.


-----

In addition, after the Issue Date, in accordance with the covenant described under “Certain

_covenants—Additional Note Guarantees and Collateral,” under certain circumstances the Parent_
will cause a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to become a Guarantor. The new
Guarantor will also, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, be required to pledge assets in favor
of the Subsidiary Note Guarantee as described under “—Security.”

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of

obligations under the Revolving Facilities Agreement and the Notes. The Agreed Security
Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant
would be restricted by applicable law, general statutory limitations, financial assistance, corporate
benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar
matters.

Each Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the

Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions
of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as
otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate benefit,
financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its
Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a
Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. See “Risk factors—Risks
_related to our indebtedness, the Notes and the Guarantees—Each Note Guarantee is subject to_
_certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain_
_defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.”_

The Note Guarantee provided by the Parent (the “Parent Guarantee”) and the Subsidiary

Note Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor will terminate upon:

(1) in the case of a Subsidiary Note Guarantee only, a sale or other disposition
(including by way of consolidation or merger) of Capital Stock of the relevant
Guarantor or of a Holding Entity thereof, such that such Guarantor ceases to be a
Restricted Subsidiary, or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets
of the relevant Guarantor (other than to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary), in
each case in a transaction otherwise permitted by the Indenture;

(2) in the case of a Subsidiary Note Guarantee only, the designation in accordance with
the Indenture of the relevant Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(3) defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—
_Satisfaction and discharge”;_

(4) in the case of a Subsidiary Note Guarantee only (other than a Subsidiary Note
Guarantee issued on or about the Issue Date), to the extent that the relevant
Guarantor becomes a Guarantor solely due to the operation of the first paragraph
of the covenant described under “Certain covenants—Additional Note Guarantees
_and Collateral,” upon the release of the relevant guarantee or discharge of_
Indebtedness referred to in such paragraph;


-----

(5) in the case of any Note Guarantee given by any parent of the IPO Pushdown Entity,
pursuant to the provisions described below under “—IPO Pushdown”;

(6) upon full payment of all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the
Indenture and the Notes; or

(7) in connection with certain enforcement actions taken by the creditors under certain
of our secured Indebtedness as provided under the Intercreditor Agreement.

Claims of creditors of non-guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured

creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of
preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries will have priority with respect
to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Parent, including
Holders. The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated to creditors
(including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of any current and
future Subsidiaries of the Parent that do not become Guarantors.

**Security**

**_The Collateral_**

No later than the Issue Date, subject to the release of the guarantees and security securing

the Group’s existing financing arrangements and to the operation of the Agreed Security
Principles, certain perfection requirements, the applicable Transaction Security Documents and
the grant of further Permitted Collateral Liens, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured
by certain security granted by TopCo in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the secured
parties (which includes the Trustee on behalf of the Holders), including:

(a) a limited recourse English law share charge over all shares in the Parent; and

(b) an English law security assignment over any structural intercompany loans from
TopCo to the Parent;

(collectively, the “Closing Date Collateral”).

No later than two business days from the Issue Date, subject to the operation of the Agreed

Security Principles, certain perfection requirements, the applicable Transaction Security
Documents and the grant of further Permitted Collateral Liens, the Notes and the Note Guarantees
will be secured by certain security granted by the Issuer and the Guarantors in favor of the Security
Agent for the benefit of the secured parties (which includes the Trustee on behalf of the Holders),
including an English law debenture over certain material assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors
(including the Parent) that are incorporated in England, including first fixed equitable security over
any leasehold interests other than any leasehold interest that has 35 years or less to run, subject to
receipt of landlord consent (if required) (the “Post Closing Date Collateral” and, together with the
Closing Date Collateral, the “Collateral”).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain assets may not be secured or such security may not

be perfected in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, including:


-----

    - if the cost of providing security is not proportionate to the benefit accruing to the
Holders and the other secured parties;

    - if providing such security requires consent of a third party and, if the asset is material,
such consent cannot be obtained after the use of reasonable endeavors;

    - if providing such security would be prohibited by applicable law, general statutory
limitations, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin
capitalization” rules or similar matters or entering into the Transaction Security
Documents would conflict with fiduciary duties of directors, contravene any legal or
regulatory prohibition or result in a risk of personal or criminal liability on the part of
directors or officers;

    - if the granting of security or perfecting such security would have a material adverse
effect on the ability of such Subsidiary to conduct its operations and business in the
ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the Indenture; and

    - in the case of bank accounts, notices to the banks with whom the accounts are
maintained will only be served if required by local laws to perfect the relevant
security.

**_Administration and enforcement of security_**

The Transaction Security Documents and the Collateral will be administered by a Security

Agent (or in certain circumstances a receiver or delegate) pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement
for the benefit of all the secured parties. For a description of the Intercreditor Agreement, see
“Description of other financial arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The ability of Holders to realize the Collateral will be subject to various insolvency law

limitations in the event of the security provider’s insolvency and various contractual limitations
set out in the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness, the
_Notes and the Guarantees—English insolvency laws and other jurisdictions may provide you with_
_less protection than U.S. bankruptcy law” and “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness,_
_the Notes and the Guarantees—Each Note Guarantee is subject to certain limitations on_
_enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit_
_its validity and enforceability.”_

The Transaction Security Documents will provide that the rights of the Holders with

respect to the Collateral must be exercised by the Security Agent. Since the Holders will not be a
party to the Transaction Security Documents, Holders may not, individually or collectively, take
any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Transaction Security Documents.
The Holders may only act through the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable. The Security
Agent will agree to release a security interest created by the Transaction Security Documents at
the direction of the Trustee that is in accordance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement without requiring any consent of the Holders. Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Indenture, the Holders, in certain circumstances, will share in the ability to
direct the Trustee to direct the Security Agent to commence enforcement action under the


-----

Transaction Security Documents. See “Description of other financial arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement.”_

Subject to the terms of the Transaction Security Documents, the Issuer, Topco and the

Guarantors have the right to remain in possession and retain control of the Collateral securing the
Notes (other than as set forth in the Transaction Security Documents), to freely operate the
Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom.

No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Parent in

connection with the issuance of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the
sale of the Collateral remaining after the payment of obligations under the Revolving Facilities
Agreement or other super priority obligations would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed
to the Holders as well as any other obligations secured on a pari passu basis. By its nature, some
or all the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or
at all. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness, the Notes and the Guarantees—The
_Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that will have been granted_
_as security for the Notes and the Guarantees, and such security may not be sufficient to satisfy the_
_obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.”_

By accepting a Note, each Holder, will be deemed to have:

    - irrevocably appointed GLAS Trust Corporation Limited, as Security Agent, in each
case to act as its security agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the other
relevant documents to which the security agent is a party (including, without
limitation, the Transaction Security Documents);

    - irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the
rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor
Agreement or other documents to which the Security Agent is a party, together with
any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each document
expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf; and

    - accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein) and each Holder will also be deemed to
have authorized the Trustee to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

In addition, the terms of the Transaction Security Documents themselves may provide for

assets to cease to become subject to security in certain circumstances without the need for a formal
release (such as the sale of assets which are subject to a charge) or the exclusion of certain assets
from a debenture if such assets may not be subject to security (such as, for example, assets that
may not be validly pledged or assets that are subject to a Permitted Lien).


-----

**_Release of Liens_**

The Security Agent shall release, and, if so requested, the Trustee shall direct the Security

Agent to release, without the need for consent of the Holders, Liens on the Collateral securing the
Notes:

(1) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes
issued under the Indenture or discharge or defeasance thereof;

(2) upon release of a Note Guarantee (with respect to the Liens securing such Note
Guarantee granted by such Guarantor);

(3) in connection with any disposition of Collateral to any Person; provided that if the
Collateral is disposed to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary, the relevant
Collateral becomes immediately subject to a substantially equivalent Lien in favor
of the Security Agent securing the Notes (but excluding any transaction subject to
“—Certain covenants—Merger and consolidation—The Issuer and the Parent”);
_provided, further, that, in each case, such disposition is permitted by the Indenture;_

(4) if the Parent designates any Subsidiary Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary
in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the
property, assets and Capital Stock of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(5) in connection with certain enforcement actions taken by the creditors under certain
of our secured Indebtedness as provided under the Intercreditor Agreement, or
otherwise in compliance with the Intercreditor Agreement;

(6) as may be permitted by the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—
_Impairment of security interest”;_

(7) in connection with an IPO Pushdown, as specified in the Indenture; and

(8) in order to effectuate a merger, consolidation, conveyance or transfer conducted in
compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Merger and
_consolidation.”_

Each of these releases shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the

Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee unless otherwise requested.

**IPO Pushdown**

(a) On, in contemplation of, or following an IPO Event, the Parent shall be entitled to
require (by written notice to the Trustee (a “Pushdown Notice”)) that the terms of
the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) shall operate (with effect from the date specified in the relevant
Pushdown Notice (the “Pushdown Date”)) on the basis that: (i) references to the
Parent and Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) shall apply only to
the IPO Pushdown Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time,


-----

although the Issuer shall remain the same entity and the shares of the Issuer shall
be subject to a Lien in favor of the “Secured Parties” (as defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement), that is substantially
equivalent to the pledge of the shares of the Issuer entered into in connection with
the Offering; (ii) all financial ratio, basket calculations and financial definitions
shall exclude any Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity and all reporting
obligations shall be assumed at the level of the IPO Pushdown Entity; (iii) each
reference in the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) to the “Parent” shall be deemed to be a reference to the
IPO Pushdown Entity (to the extent applicable and unless the context requires
otherwise); _provided_ that nothing in this paragraph (a), including the deeming
construct contemplated by this sub-paragraph (iii) and any action taken by the IPO
Pushdown Entity prior to it being deemed to be the Parent, shall, or shall be deemed
to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any covenant or other
term in the Indenture or a Default or an Event of Default; (iv) none of the
representations, warranties, undertakings, covenants or Events of Default in the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or
the Transaction Security Documents shall apply to any entity of which the IPO
Pushdown Entity is a Subsidiary (whether in its capacity as a Guarantor or
otherwise); (v) no event, matter or circumstance relating to any Holding Company
of the IPO Pushdown Entity (whether in its capacity as a Guarantor or otherwise)
shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of
any covenant or other term in the Indenture or a Default or an Event of Default; (vi)
each Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be irrevocably and
unconditionally released from all obligations under the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and any security granted
by any such Holding Company (subject to sub-clause (i) above); and (vii) unless
otherwise notified by the Parent: (A) each person which is party to the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an “Investor” or an
“Intra-Group Lender” shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and all
obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement (and from the date specified by the Parent that Person shall
cease to be party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) as an Investor or Intra-Group Lender, as the case may be, and shall
have no further rights or obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor or Intra-Group Lender, as the
case may be); and (B) there shall be no obligation or requirement for any Person to
become party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) as an Investor or Intra-Group Lender, as the case may be; and (viii) in
the event that any Person is released from or does not become party to the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor
or Intra-Group Lender, as the case may be, as a consequence of this paragraph (a),
any term of the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) which requires or assumes that any Person be an Investor
or Intra-Group Lender, as the case may be, or that any liabilities or obligations to


-----

such Person be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) or otherwise subordinated shall cease to apply. An IPO
Pushdown Notice may not be delivered if a Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing (disregarding any Default or Event of Default that could
be deemed to arise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
provision).

(b) The Trustee and the Security Agent shall be required to enter into any amendment
to the Indenture or amendment to or replacement of the Intercreditor Agreement or
the Transaction Security Documents required by the Parent in writing and/or take
such other action as is required by the Parent in order to facilitate or reflect any of
the matters contemplated by paragraph (a) above (the “IPO Pushdown”); provided
that such amendment, replacement or other document or instrument does not
impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or, in the opinion of the Trustee,
does not affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnification or immunities of the
Trustee under such amendment, replacement or other document or instrument. The
Trustee and the Security Agent are each irrevocably authorized and instructed by
the Holders (without any consent by the Holders) to execute any such amended or
replacement documents and/or take such other action on behalf of the Holders (and
shall do so on the request of and at the cost of the Parent).

(c) For the purpose of this covenant, the “IPO Pushdown Entity” shall be the Parent or
any Restricted Subsidiary of the Parent notified to the Trustee by the Parent in
writing as the Person to be treated as the IPO Entity in relation to the relevant IPO
Event; provided that: (i) the IPO Entity shall be a Restricted Subsidiary which will
issue shares, or whose shares are to be sold, pursuant to that IPO Event (or a
Holding Company of such member of the Group); (ii) the Issuer shall become a
Restricted Subsidiary of the IPO Pushdown Entity; and (iii) the Parent may not
designate as the IPO Pushdown Entity any entity which is not a direct or indirect
Holding Company of Restricted Subsidiaries constituting all or substantially all of
the Group’s assets.

(d) If the Parent delivers a Pushdown Notice to the Trustee pursuant to paragraph (a)
above in relation to a contemplated IPO Event, it shall be entitled to revoke that
Pushdown Notice at any time prior to the occurrence of the relevant IPO Event by
written notice to the Trustee. In the event that any Pushdown Notice is revoked in
accordance with this paragraph (d): (i) the provisions of sub-paragraphs (a)(i) to
(a)(vii) above shall cease to apply in relation to that Pushdown Notice; (ii) if any
security has been released pursuant to paragraph (a) above in reliance on that
Pushdown Notice, if required by the Trustee by prior written notice to the Parent
and subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Parent or the relevant Restricted
Subsidiary shall as soon as reasonably practicable execute a replacement
Transaction Security Document in respect of that security; and (iii) if any Person
party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement)
as an Investor or Intra-Group Lender, as the case may be, has been released from
the Intercreditor Agreement pursuant to sub-paragraph (a)(vii) above in reliance on
that Pushdown Notice, if required by the Trustee by prior written notice to the


-----

Parent and that Person, that Person shall as soon as reasonably practicable accede
to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an
Investor or Intra-Group Lender, as the case may be.

For the avoidance of doubt: (A) nothing in paragraph (d) above shall prohibit or otherwise

restrict the Parent from delivering a further Pushdown Notice in relation to any actual or
contemplated IPO Event; and (B) revocation of a Pushdown Notice shall not, and shall not be
deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty,
undertaking or other term in the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) or a Default or an Event of Default (whether by reason of any action or
step taken by any Person, or any matter or circumstance arising or committed, while that Pushdown
Notice was effective or otherwise).

**Intercreditor Agreement**

On or about the Issue Date, the Issuer, the Parent, the Trustee, the Security Agent and the

other parties thereto shall enter into the Intercreditor Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Revolving Facilities
Agreement and any Hedging Agreements (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) that are
secured by Collateral that also secures our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees,
will receive priority with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any
such assets. Any remaining proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any Collateral,
after all obligations under the Revolving Facilities Agreement and Hedging Agreements have been
repaid from such recoveries, will be applied pro rata in repayment of all obligations under the
Indenture, the Notes and any other indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors permitted to be
Incurred and secured by the Collateral.

**_Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Parent, in connection with the

Incurrence or refinancing by the Issuer, the Parent or its Restricted Subsidiaries of any
Indebtedness secured or permitted to be secured on the Collateral, the Issuer, the Parent, the
relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, shall enter into
an intercreditor or similar agreement or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the
existing Intercreditor Agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) with the holders of
such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) on substantially the same terms as the
Intercreditor Agreement (or on terms that in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors or
an Officer of the Parent are not materially less favorable to the Holders), including containing
substantially the same terms with respect to the application of the proceeds of the collateral held
thereunder and the means of enforcement, it being understood that an increase in the amount of
Indebtedness being subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement will not be deemed to be less favorable to the Holders and will be permitted by this
covenant if the Incurrence of such Indebtedness and any Lien in its favor is permitted by the “—
_Certain covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain covenants—Limitation on Liens”_
covenants; provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal
obligations on the Trustee or, in the opinion of the Trustee, adversely affect the rights, duties,
liabilities or immunities of the Trustee under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement. As used


-----

herein, the term “Intercreditor Agreement” shall include references to any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement that supplements or replaces the Intercreditor Agreement entered into on the Issue
Date.

The Indenture will provide that, at the written direction of the Parent and without the

consent of the Holders, the Trustee shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to
any Intercreditor Agreement to: (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of any
such agreement, (ii) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement
that may be Incurred by the Issuer that is subject to any such agreement (provided that such
Indebtedness is Incurred in compliance with the Indenture), (iii) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the
Intercreditor Agreement, (iv) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes Incurred in
compliance with the Indenture), (v) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral
to secure Additional Notes Incurred in compliance with the Indenture or to implement any
Permitted Collateral Liens, (vi) effect the IPO Pushdown or (vii) make any other change to any
such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect. The Parent shall
not otherwise direct the Trustee to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement
without the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments and waivers” or as
permitted by the terms of such Intercreditor Agreement, and the Parent may only direct the Trustee
to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal
obligations on the Trustee or, in the opinion of the Trustee, adversely affect the rights, duties,
liabilities or immunities of the Trustee under the Indenture relating to the Notes or any Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Indenture will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have

agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of any Intercreditor Agreement (whether then
entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein), and to have
authorized the Trustee to enter into any one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement
as contemplated above.

**The Proceeds Loan Agreement**

Upon the issuance of the Notes, the Issuer, as lender, and the Parent, as borrower, will enter

into a proceeds loan agreement (the “Proceeds Loan Agreement”) pursuant to which the Issuer
will loan to the Parent the gross proceeds from the issuance of each series of Notes (each a
“Proceeds Loan”).

These Proceeds Loans will be in euro and/or pound sterling in aggregate principal amount

equal to the gross proceeds of the Notes. See “Use of proceeds.” The Proceeds Loans will bear
interest at a rate sufficient to pay the interest expense on the Notes. Interest on the Proceeds Loans
will be payable semi-annually in arrears on or prior to the corresponding date for the payment of
interest on the Notes.

The Proceeds Loan Agreement will provide that the Parent will pay the Issuer interest and

principal due and payable on the Notes and any Additional Amounts due thereunder. All amounts
payable under the Proceeds Loans will be payable to such account or accounts with such Person
or Persons as the Issuer may designate. The maturity date of the Proceeds Loans will be the same


-----

as the maturity date of the Notes. Except as otherwise required by law, all payments under the
Proceeds Loan Agreement will be made without deductions or withholding for, or on account of,
any applicable tax. In the event that the Parent is required to make any such deduction or
withholding, the Parent shall gross-up each payment to the Issuer to ensure that the Issuer receives
and retains a net payment equal to the payment which it would have received had no such
deduction or withholding been made.

The Proceeds Loan Agreement will provide that the Parent will make all payments pursuant

thereto on a timely basis in order to ensure that the Issuer can satisfy its payment obligations under
the Notes and the Indenture, taking into account the administrative and timing requirements under
the Indenture with respect to amounts payable on the Notes.

The Issuer’s rights under the Proceeds Loan Agreement will be assigned by way of security

to the Security Agent and will comprise part of the Collateral, as described above under “—
_Security—The Collateral.”_

**Optional redemption**

at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount of the Sterling Notes redeemed, plus

relevant interest payment date).

**_General_**

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and notice” below.

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of Notes of a series, it will, if and for so long

as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to the extent that the rules
of the Exchange so require, inform the Exchange of such optional redemption and confirm the


-----

aggregate principal amount of the Notes of that series that will remain outstanding immediately
after such redemption.

Any redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more

conditions precedent (including, in the case of a redemption related to an Equity Offering, the
consummation of such Equity Offering). In addition, if such redemption is subject to satisfaction
of one or more conditions precedent, the notice of redemption may state that, at the Issuer’s
discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall
be satisfied, or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that
any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the
redemption date so delayed; provided that in no case shall the notice have been delivered less than
10 days or more than 60 days prior to the date on which such redemption (if any) occurs.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the

related interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose
name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest
will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

We may repurchase Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or

otherwise.

**_Sinking fund_**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund

payments with respect to the Notes.

**_Selection and notice_**

If less than all the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the Registrar

will select the Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities
exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed, as certified to the Paying Agent or the Registrar
by the Issuer, and in compliance with the requirements of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or if the
Notes are not so listed, or such exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Notes are not
held through Euroclear and/or Clearstream or Euroclear and/or Clearstream prescribes no method
of selection, on a pro rata basis or by use of a pool-factor; provided, however, that no Note of
€100,000 or £100,000, as the case may be, or less in aggregate principal amount shall be redeemed
in part. None of the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Registrar shall be liable for selections made
by it under this paragraph.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to

the extent the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer shall notify the Exchange of such
redemption and, in addition to such publication, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior to
the redemption date, email such notice to Holders at their respective addresses as they appear on
the registration books of the Registrar; provided that, for so long as any Notes are represented by
Global Notes, notices of redemption to Holders will be delivered to Euroclear and Clearstream
(and such delivery will be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph), each of which
shall give notices to the holders of the Book-Entry Interests.


-----

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note

shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of
the original Note will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original
Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease
the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the
terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein), Notes
called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption
date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption, unless the
redemption price is not paid on the redemption date.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer or Successor Company (as defined herein) may redeem, and a Guarantor may

cause the Issuer or Successor Company to redeem, the Notes in whole, but not in part, at its
discretion at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice to the Holders
(which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal
amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date fixed
for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional
Amounts (see “—Additional Amounts”), if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax
Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Issuer determines that as
a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations or rulings
promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined under “—
_Additional Amounts”) affecting taxation; or_

(2) any change in, or amendment to, the application, administration or interpretation of
such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including pursuant to a holding,
judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published
practice) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and
(2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

the Issuer, Successor Company or Guarantor are, or on the next interest payment date in respect of
the Notes or any Note Guarantee would be, required to pay any Additional Amounts or increased
Additional Amounts, and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures
available to the Issuer, Successor Company or Guarantor (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable and, in the case of a
payment by a Guarantor, having the Issuer or another Guarantor make the payment, but not
including assignment of the obligation to make payment with respect to the Notes). In the case of
redemption due to withholding as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that is a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at the date on which the applicable Notes are issued, such Change in
Tax Law must become effective on or after the date on which the applicable Notes are issued. In
the case of redemption due to withholding as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that
becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction after the date on which the applicable Notes are issued,
such Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the date the jurisdiction becomes a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (or, in the case of a Successor Company, on or after the date of


-----

assumption by the Successor Company of the Issuer’s obligations hereunder). Notice of
redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described
under “—Selection and notice.”

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than

90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obliged to make such payment of
Additional Amounts and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such
Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of
redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer, Successor Company or Guarantor
will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such
redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right
so to redeem have been satisfied and that it would not be able to avoid the obligation to pay
Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) an opinion of an
independent tax counsel of recognized standing to the effect that the Issuer, Successor Company
or Guarantor has or have been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of
a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will be entitled to rely solely upon such Officer’s Certificate
and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above,
without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Additional Amounts**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or a Successor Company under or with

respect to the Notes, or any Guarantor (each of the Issuer, Successor Company and Guarantor, a
“Payor”) with respect to any Note Guarantee, will be made free and clear of and without
withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of
such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any
Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) the United Kingdom or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority
thereof or therein having power to tax;

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Note
Guarantee is made by or on behalf of the Issuer, Successor Company, Guarantor or
their agents, or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or
therein having the power to tax; or

(3) any other jurisdiction in which the Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in
business for tax purposes, resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or
Governmental Authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause
(1), (2) and (3), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required from any payments made with respect to any Note or Note Guarantee,
including payments of principal, purchase or redemption price, premium, if any, or interest, the
Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”)
as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by the
Holders or the Trustee, as the case may be, after such withholding or deduction (including any
such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts


-----

which would have been received in respect of such payments on any such Note or Note Guarantee
in the absence of such withholding or deduction; _provided, however, that no such Additional_
Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present
or former connection between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner of a Note
(or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor
of power over the relevant Holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or
beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company
or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, but not limited to,
being a citizen or resident or national or domiciliary of, or the existence of a
business, a permanent establishment, a dependent agent, a place of business or a
place of management present or deemed present in the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the
acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or Note Guarantee, the enforcement
of rights under a Note or Note Guarantee or the receipt of any payment in respect
thereof;

(2) any Taxes that are imposed, withheld or deducted by reason of the failure by the
Holder or the beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a written request of the
Payor addressed to the Holder or the beneficial owner, after reasonable notice, to
provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the
nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim
or satisfy any certification, identification, information or other reporting
requirement relating to such matters, required by applicable law, regulation, treaty
or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to
exemption from or reduction in the rate of all or part of such Tax; provided in each
case the Holder or beneficial owner is legally eligible to do so;

(3) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a
payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee;

(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, value added, sales, transfer, personal property or
similar Taxes;

(5) any Taxes imposed with respect to any withholding or deduction that is imposed in
connection with Sections 1471-1474 of the Code and U.S. Treasury regulations
thereunder (“FATCA”), any intergovernmental agreement between the United
States and any other jurisdiction implementing or relating to FATCA or any nonU.S. law, regulation or guidance enacted or issued with respect thereto;

(6) any Taxes which would not have been imposed if the Holder had presented the Note
for payment (where presentation is permitted or required for payment) within 30
days after the relevant payment was first made available for payment to the Holder
(except for Additional Amounts with respect to Taxes that would have been


-----

imposed had the Holder presented the Note for payment within such 30-day
period);

(7) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to a payment to a Holder that is a fiduciary
or partnership or any Person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment
or Note, to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, a
member of such partnership or the beneficial owner of such payment or Note would
not have been entitled to the Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor,
member or beneficial owner been the actual Holder of such Note; or

(8) any combination of the above.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full

amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable
law. The Payor will use reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the
payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing
such Taxes, in such form as provided in the ordinary course by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
and as is reasonably available to the Payor, and if so obtained by the Payor will provide such
certified copies to the Trustee. If so obtained, such copies shall be made available to the Holders
upon request. The Payor will attach to each certified copy a certificate stating (x) that the amount
of withholding Taxes evidenced by the certified copy was paid in connection with payments in
respect of the principal amount of Notes then outstanding and (y) the amount of such withholding
Taxes paid per £1,000 or €1,000 principal amount of the Notes, as the case may be.

If any Payor becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or

with respect to any payment made on any Note or Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the
date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and Paying Agent an Officer’s
Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount so payable and
such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to
Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises,
or the Payor becomes aware of such obligation, less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment
date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable
after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and Paying Agent shall be
entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate without further inquiry, as conclusive proof that
such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Note Guarantees or this “Description of the Notes” there

are mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase or redemption prices in connection with a purchase or redemption of
Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or Note Guarantees,


-----

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this
heading to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in
respect thereof.

The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary Taxes, or any other

excise, property or similar Taxes that arise in any jurisdiction from the execution, delivery,
registration or enforcement of any Notes, any Note Guarantee, the Indenture, the Proceeds Loan
Agreement, the Transaction Security Documents or any other document or instrument in relation
thereto (other than a transfer or exchange of the Notes) excluding any such Taxes, charges or
similar levies imposed by any jurisdiction that is not a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction.

The foregoing obligations of this “Additional Amounts” section will survive any

termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will apply _mutatis mutandis to any_
jurisdiction in which any successor to the Issuer or any Guarantor is organized or any political
subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms hereof, each Holder will have the right

to require the Issuer to repurchase all (equal to £100,000 or €100,000 aggregate principal amount,
and integral multiples of £1,000 or €1,000 in excess thereof, as the case may be) of such Holder’s
Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued
and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record
on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided,
_however, that the Issuer shall not be obliged to repurchase Notes as described under this “Change_
_of Control” section in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to_
redeem all of the Notes as described under “—Optional redemption” or all conditions to such
redemption have been satisfied or waived.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as

described under “—Optional redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied
or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will send
a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of any such Notes, by email or otherwise
in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder
has the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes
at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes
plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not
including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record
date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of
_Control Payment”);_

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60
days from the date such notice is sent) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or
transactions that constitute the Change of Control;


-----

(4) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture,
that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(5) if such notice is emailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that
the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of
Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the

Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment
in respect of all Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the
aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the
Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent
the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions
thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the
relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for
purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly wire

to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such
Notes, and the Trustee or an authentication agent appointed by the Trustee will promptly
authenticate (or cause to be authenticated) and mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes
a new Definitive Registered Note equal in an aggregate principal amount to the unpurchased
portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in an aggregate
principal amount that is at least £100,000 or €100,000 or an integral multiple of £1,000 or €1,000
in excess thereof.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to

the extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any
Change of Control Offer.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made

in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control; provided that the
Change of Control Payment Date will be no earlier than 30 days from the date a notice of such
Change of Control Offer is emailed.

The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any

other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a


-----

Change of Control, the Indenture will not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that
the Issuer repurchases or redeems the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar
transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s
Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire
the Parent or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of

Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and
otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of
Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn
under such Change of Control Offer.

If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of

outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer
and the Issuer, or any third-party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as
described above, purchases all of the applicable series of Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn
by such Holders, the Issuer or such third-party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more
than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes of the applicable series that remain
outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal
amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes that remain outstanding to,
but excluding, the date of redemption (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the redemption
date). In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the
applicable series of then outstanding Notes have validly tendered and not withdrawn Notes in a
Change of Control Offer for all of the Notes of the applicable series, as applicable, Notes owned
by an affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any affiliate of the Issuer, or any
successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer or other
offer, as applicable.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of

the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which
the Notes are then listed) in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with
provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and
regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the
Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict.

A Change of Control will result in a mandatory prepayment under the Revolving Facilities

Agreement. Future debt of the Parent or its Subsidiaries, including the Issuer, may prohibit the
Issuer from purchasing Notes in the event of a Change of Control or provide that a Change of
Control is a default or may require repurchase upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise
by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to purchase the Notes could cause a default under,
or require a repurchase of, other debt, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the
financial effect of the purchase on the Parent or the Issuer.


-----

Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change

of Control may be limited by the Issuer’s and the Parent’s then existing financial resources. There
can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make the required
purchase of the Notes. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness, the Notes and the
_Guarantees—We may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a_
_change of control.”_

In addition, the definition of “Change of Control” and “Permitted Holders” expressly

permit a third party to obtain control of the Parent in a transaction which is a Specified Change of
Control Event without any obligation to make a Change of Control Offer.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of

the property and assets of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified
other Persons.

Although there is limited case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no

precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly,
in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. As a
result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder
may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to

repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written
consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes under the
Indenture.

**Certain covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any

Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness); _provided, however, that the Parent and any_
Restricted Subsidiary may Incur Indebtedness if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving
pro forma effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio for the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the most recently ended
four fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the
date on which such additional Indebtedness is Incurred would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following

Indebtedness:

(1) Indebtedness Incurred by the Parent and any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to any
Credit Facility (including in respect of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances
issued or created thereunder), and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof
and Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness in a maximum aggregate principal
amount of Indebtedness then outstanding not exceeding: (i) the greater of (x) £178
million and (y) 100% of Consolidated EBITDA, plus (ii) in the case of any


-----

refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion
thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other
costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(2) (a) Guarantees by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of
the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, so long as the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness being guaranteed is permitted under the
terms of the Indenture (other than pursuant to this clause (2)); provided that,
if Indebtedness being guaranteed is subordinated or pari passu to the Notes
or a Note Guarantee, then the guarantee must be subordinated or pari passu
to the Notes or Note Guarantees, as applicable, to the same extent as the
Indebtedness guaranteed; or

(b) without limiting the covenant described under “Limitation on Liens,”
Indebtedness arising by reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such
Person securing Indebtedness of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary, in
each case, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under
the terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Parent owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or
Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Parent or any
Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) Indebtedness represented by:

(a) any Notes (other than any Additional Notes);

(b) any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness described in clauses (1), (3),
(4)(a) and (7) of this paragraph) of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary
entered into or outstanding on the Issue Date after giving effect to the
Transactions;

(c) Refinancing Indebtedness that is Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness
described in this clause (4) (other than Refinancing Indebtedness that is
Incurred in respect of any Notes and any Note Guarantee, which will be
deemed to have been Incurred under clause (4)(a) of this paragraph) or
clause (5) of this paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of
this covenant;

(d) Management Advances and MEP Payments; and

(e) the Proceeds Loans;

(5) Indebtedness (i) of any Person Incurred and outstanding on the date on which such
Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or is merged, consolidated, amalgamated
or otherwise combined with (including pursuant to any acquisition of assets and
assumption of related liabilities) the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii)
Incurred to provide or refinance all or any portion of the funds utilized to


-----

consummate a transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which a
Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Parent or
a Restricted Subsidiary or otherwise in connection with or contemplation of such
acquisition; provided, however, with respect to sub-clauses (5)(i) and (5)(ii), that at
the time of such acquisition or other transaction (x) the Parent and its Restricted
Subsidiaries would have been permitted to Incur £1.00 of additional Indebtedness
pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant after giving pro forma effect to the
relevant acquisition and Incurrence of such Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (5)
or (y) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Parent and its Restricted
Subsidiaries for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters for which internal
financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such
additional Indebtedness is Incurred would not be lower than it was immediately
prior to giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction;

(6) Indebtedness under Hedging Agreements entered into for bona fide hedging
purposes of the Parent or its Restricted Subsidiaries and not for speculative
purposes (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of
the Parent);

(7) Indebtedness consisting of (A) Capitalized Lease Obligations, mortgage financings,
Purchase Money Obligations or other financings, Incurred for the purpose of
financing all or any part of the purchase price or cost of construction or

Indebtedness otherwise Incurred to finance the purchase, lease, rental or cost of
design, construction, installation or improvement of property (real or personal) or
equipment that is used or useful in a Similar Business, whether through the direct
purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such assets, and (C)
any Refinancing Indebtedness and Guarantees in respect of sub-clauses (A) or (B),
in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the
principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (7) then
outstanding, will not exceed the greater of (i) £45 million and (ii) 25% of
Consolidated EBITDA;

(8) Indebtedness in respect of (a) workers’ compensation claims, self-insurance
obligations, performance, indemnity, surety, judgment, appeal, advance payment,
customs, VAT or other tax or other guarantees or other similar bonds, instruments
or obligations and completion guarantees and warranties provided by the Parent or
a Restricted Subsidiary or relating to liabilities, obligations, indemnities or
guarantees Incurred in the ordinary course of business or for governmental or
regulatory requirements, (b) letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, guarantees or
other similar instruments or obligations issued or relating to liabilities or
obligations Incurred in the ordinary course of business, (c) the financing of
insurance premiums in the ordinary course of business, and (d) any credit
management, cash management, cash pooling, net balance transfer or netting or
setting off or similar arrangements in the ordinary course of business of the Parent
and the Restricted Subsidiaries;


-----

(9) Indebtedness arising from agreements providing for guarantees, indemnification,
obligations in respect of earn-outs or other adjustments of purchase price or, in each
case, similar obligations, in each case, Incurred or assumed in connection with the

acquiring or disposing of such business or assets or such Subsidiary for the purpose
of financing such acquisition or disposition);

(10) (A) Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial
institution of a check, draft or similar instrument drawn against insufficient

manage cash balances of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries; and

(C) Indebtedness Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary in connection with
bankers’ acceptances, discounted bills of exchange or the discounting or
factoring of receivables for credit management purposes, in each case,
Incurred or undertaken in the ordinary course of business;

(11) Indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken
together with any Refinancing Indebtedness and Guarantees in respect thereof and
the aggregate principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this
clause (11) then outstanding, will not exceed the greater of (i) £89 million and (ii)
50% of Consolidated EBITDA;

(12) Indebtedness (including any Refinancing Indebtedness and Guarantees in respect
thereof) in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together
with the principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause
(12) and then outstanding, will not exceed 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds received
by the Parent from the issuance or sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary) of its
Subordinated Shareholder Funding or its Capital Stock (other than through the
Equity Contribution, Disqualified Stock, Designated Preference Shares or an
Excluded Contribution) or otherwise contributed to the equity (other than through
the Equity Contribution, issuance of Disqualified Stock, Designated Preference
Shares or an Excluded Contribution) of the Parent, in each case, subsequent to the
Issue Date; _provided, however, that (i) any such Net Cash Proceeds that are so_
received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of making Restricted
Payments under the first paragraph and clauses (1), (6), (10) and (14) of the third
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”
to the extent the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries Incur Indebtedness in
reliance thereon and (ii) any Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed
shall be excluded for purposes of Incurring Indebtedness pursuant to this clause
(12) to the extent the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries makes a Restricted


-----

Payment under the first paragraph and/or clauses (1), (6), (10) and (14) of the third
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”
in reliance thereon;

(13) Indebtedness Incurred by a Receivables Subsidiary in a Qualified Receivables
Financing; and

(14) Indebtedness under any overdraft, working capital, current account, letter of credit,
local credit line, bilateral financing line, foreign exchange, SWIFT and/or other
similar or equivalent facilities or financial accommodation, or any other facility or
financial accommodation by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary, provided that
the maximum aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness outstanding under this
clause (14) does not exceed the greater of (i) £45 million and (ii) 25% of
Consolidated EBITDA and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any

particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with this covenant:

(i) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of
Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the
Parent, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify,
such item (or any portion of such item) of Indebtedness and only be required to
include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the
second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant; provided that the Parent
may not reclassify Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date that is Incurred under
sub-clauses (1) and clause (14) of the second paragraph of this covenant. For the
avoidance of doubt, Indebtedness available on the Issue Date under the Revolving
Facilities Agreement will be Incurred under sub-clause (1) of the second paragraph
of this covenant;

(ii) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of, letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances
or other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is
otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall
not be included;

(iii) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as
Incurred pursuant to clauses (1), (7) or (11) of the second paragraph of this covenant
or the first paragraph of this covenant and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances
or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other
Indebtedness shall not be included;

(iv) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Parent or a Restricted
Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the
greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including,
in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference
thereof;


-----

(v) for the purposes of determining “Consolidated EBITDA,” (x) pro forma effect shall
be given to Consolidated EBITDA on the same basis as for calculating the
Consolidated Leverage Ratio for the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries and (y)
Consolidated EBITDA shall be measured on the most recent date on which new
commitments are obtained (in the case of revolving facilities) or the date on which
new Indebtedness is Incurred (in the case of term facilities) and for the period of
the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters ending prior to the date for which
such internal consolidated financial statements of the Parent are available;

(vi) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference
to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one
such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant
permitting such Indebtedness;

(vii) the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be calculated as
described under the definition of “Indebtedness”; _provided_ that the amount of
Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be
equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of
IFRS; and

(viii) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any

Indebtedness Incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially incurred in reliance on a
clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a
percentage of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of an Applicable Test Date, if such
refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction to be
exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the
Applicable Test Date of such refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated
EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal
amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of
such Indebtedness being refinanced.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or

amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional
Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or
Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as
Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, including a change in IFRS itself or a change from IFRS to
a different set of accounting principles, will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for
purposes of this covenant.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any

Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of
such date.

For purposes of determining compliance with any pound sterling-denominated restriction

on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Sterling Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of
Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency
exchange rate in effect on the Applicable Test Date; _provided_ that (a) if such Indebtedness is


-----

Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than pound sterling, and
such refinancing would cause the applicable pound sterling-denominated restriction to be exceeded
if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such
pound sterling-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the
aggregate principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the aggregate
principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus any amount to pay premium
(including tender premium), accrued and unpaid interest, expenses, defeasance costs and fees in
connection therewith; (b) the Sterling Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of any such
Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency
exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if and for so long as any such Indebtedness is
subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in which such Indebtedness is
denominated covering principal and interest on such Indebtedness, the amount of such
Indebtedness, if denominated in pound sterling, will be the amount of the principal payment
required to be made under such Currency Agreement and, otherwise, the Sterling Equivalent of
such amount plus the Sterling Equivalent of any premium which is at such time due and payable
but is not covered by such Currency Agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of

Indebtedness that the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall
not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies.
Subject to the preceding paragraph, the principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance
other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced,
shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such
Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or

indirectly, to:

(2) purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value any Capital Stock of the
Parent or any direct or indirect Holding Entity held by Persons other than the Parent

other acquisition or retirement or in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund
obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case, due within one year
of the date of payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other
acquisition or retirement, (b) any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (3) of
the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness”) and (c) any such payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption,_
defeasance or other acquisition or retirement that is a Permitted Investment (other
than Permitted Investments in connection with Subordinated Indebtedness pursuant

(any such dividend, distribution, payment, purchase, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, other
acquisition, retirement or Restricted Investment referred to in clauses (1) to (5) above are referred
to herein as a “Restricted Payment”), if at the time the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary makes
such Restricted Payment:

(a) a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or would result
immediately thereafter therefrom);

(b) the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not permitted to Incur an additional
£1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” after giving effect, on a pro forma basis, to
such Restricted Payment; or

(c) the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted Payments
made subsequent to the Issue Date (and not returned or rescinded) (including
Permitted Payments permitted below by clauses (5)(a) (without duplication of
amounts paid pursuant to any other clause of the second succeeding paragraph),
(6), (10), (11) and (12) of the second succeeding paragraph, but excluding all other
Restricted Payments permitted by the second succeeding paragraph) would exceed
the sum of (without duplication):

(i) 50% of Consolidated Net Income for the period (treated as one accounting
period) from the first day of the first fiscal quarter commencing after the
Issue Date to the end of the most recent fiscal quarter ending prior to the
date of such Restricted Payment for which internal consolidated financial

Income is a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit, provided that the amount
taken into account pursuant to this clause (i) shall not be less than zero);

(ii) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds, and the fair market value of
property or assets or marketable securities, received by the Parent from the
issue or sale of its Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or
Designated Preference Shares) or Subordinated Shareholder Funding
subsequent to the Issue Date or otherwise contributed to the equity (other
than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference
Shares) of the Parent subsequent to the Issue Date (other than (x) Net Cash
Proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities received from an
issuance or sale of such Capital Stock to a Restricted Subsidiary or an
employee stock ownership plan or trust established by the Parent or any
Subsidiary of the Parent for the benefit of its employees to the extent funded
by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary, (y) Net Cash Proceeds or
property or assets or marketable securities to the extent that any Restricted
Payment has been made from such proceeds in reliance on clause (6) of the
second succeeding paragraph and (z) Excluded Contributions since the
Issue Date or the Equity Contribution);

a Restricted Subsidiary or an employee stock ownership plan or trust
established by the Parent or any Subsidiary of the Parent for the benefit of
its employees to the extent funded by the Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary) by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary subsequent to the
Issue Date of any Indebtedness that has been converted into or exchanged
for Capital Stock of the Parent (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated
Preference Shares) or Subordinated Shareholder Funding (plus the amount
of any cash, and the fair market value of property or assets or marketable
securities, received by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary upon such
conversion or exchange) but excluding (x) Net Cash Proceeds to the extent
that any Restricted Payment has been made from such proceeds in reliance
on clause (6) of the second succeeding paragraph and (y) Excluded
Contributions since the Issue Date or the Equity Contribution;

(iv) the amount equal to the net reduction in Restricted Investments made by the
Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries subsequent to the Issue Date

such Restricted Investment, proceeds realized upon the sale or other
disposition to a Person other than the Parent or a Restricted
Subsidiary of any such Restricted Investment, repayments of loans
or advances or other transfers of assets (including by way of


-----

dividend, distribution, interest payments or returns of capital) to the
Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(B) the redesignation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries as Restricted
Subsidiaries (valued, in each case, as provided in the definition of
“Investment”) not to exceed, in the case of any Unrestricted
Subsidiary, the amount of Investments previously made by the
Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Unrestricted Subsidiary,
which amount, in each case under this sub-clause (iv), was included
in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments referred to
in the first sentence of this clause (c); provided, _however, that no_
amount will be included in Consolidated Net Income for purposes
of the preceding sub-clause (i) to the extent that it is (at the Parent’s
option) included under this sub-clause (iv); and

(v) the amount of the cash and the fair market value of property or assets or of
marketable securities received by the Parent or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries subsequent to the Issue Date in connection with:

by the Parent or any Subsidiary of the Parent for the benefit of its
employees to the extent funded by the Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary) of Capital Stock of an Unrestricted Subsidiary; and

(B) any dividend or distribution made by an Unrestricted Subsidiary or
Affiliate to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary;

_provided, however, that no amount will be included in Consolidated Net_

Income for purposes of the preceding sub-clause (i) to the extent that it is
(at the Parent’s option) included under this sub-clause (v).

The fair market value of property or assets other than cash covered by the preceding

paragraph shall be the fair market value thereof as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors or an Officer of the Parent. The fair market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall
be its face amount.

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit any of the following (collectively, “Permitted

_Payments”):_

(1) any Restricted Payment made in exchange (including any such exchange pursuant
to the exercise of a conversion right or privilege in connection with which cash is
paid in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares) for, or out of the proceeds of the
substantially concurrent sale of, Capital Stock of the Parent (other than Disqualified
Stock, Excluded Amounts or Designated Preference Shares), Subordinated
Shareholder Funding or a substantially concurrent contribution to the equity (in
each case, other than through the Equity Contribution, issuance of Disqualified

Net Cash Proceeds, or fair market value (as determined in accordance with the
immediately preceding paragraph and the immediately succeeding paragraph) of
property or assets or of marketable securities, from such sale of Capital Stock,
Subordinated Shareholder Funding or such contribution will be excluded from subclause (c)(ii) of the second preceding paragraph;

(2) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement

to be Incurred pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness,” and that in each case, constitutes Refinancing Indebtedness;_

(4) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement
of Subordinated Indebtedness:

(a) from Net Available Cash to the extent permitted by the covenant described
under “—Limitation on sales of assets and Subsidiary stock,” but only if the
Parent shall have first complied with the terms of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on sales of assets and Subsidiary stock” and purchased
all Notes validly tendered pursuant to any offer to repurchase all the Notes
required thereby, prior to purchasing, repurchasing, redeeming, defeasing
or otherwise acquiring or retiring such Subordinated Indebtedness; or

(b) to the extent required by the agreement governing such Subordinated
Indebtedness, following the occurrence of a Change of Control (or other
similar event described therein as a “change of control”), but only (i) if the
Parent shall have first complied with the terms of the covenant described
under “—Change of Control,” if required, and purchased all Notes validly
tendered pursuant to the offer to repurchase all the Notes required thereby,
prior to purchasing, repurchasing, redeeming, defeasing or otherwise
acquiring or retiring such Subordinated Indebtedness and (ii) at a purchase
price not greater than 101% of the principal amount of such Subordinated

Public Offering of such common stock or common equity interests, in an amount
not to exceed in any fiscal year the greater of (a) 6% of the Net Cash Proceeds


-----

received by the Parent from such Public Offering or contributed to the equity (other
than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares or
through Excluded Amounts, the Equity Contribution or an Excluded Contribution)
of the Parent or loaned or contributed as Subordinated Shareholder Funding to the
Parent, and (b) following the Initial Public Offering, 7% of the Market
Capitalization;

(11) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (or would
result from) (a) Restricted Payments (including loans or advances) in an aggregate
amount outstanding at any time not to exceed the greater of £36 million or 20% of
Consolidated EBITDA, and (b) any Restricted Payment, _provided_ that the
Consolidated Leverage Ratio on a pro forma basis after giving effect to any such
Restricted Payment does not exceed 4.00 to 1.0; provided that if an Investment is
made pursuant to this clause (11) in a Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary and
such Person subsequently becomes or is subsequently designated a Restricted
Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, such Investment shall thereafter
be deemed to have been made pursuant to paragraphs (1) or (2) of the definition of
“Permitted Investment” and not this clause (11);

(12) payments by the Parent, or loans, advances, dividends or distributions to any
Holding Entity to make payments to holders of Capital Stock of the Parent or any
Holding Entity in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares of such Capital Stock;
_provided, however, that any such payment, loan, advance, dividend or distribution_
shall not be for the purpose of evading any limitation of this covenant or otherwise
to facilitate any dividend or other return of capital to the holders of such Capital
Stock (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the
Parent);

(13) Restricted Payments in an aggregate amount outstanding at any time not to exceed
the fair market value of Excluded Contributions, or consisting of non-cash
Excluded Contributions, or Investments to the extent made in exchange for or using
as consideration Investments previously made under this clause (13); provided that,
the amount of Excluded Contributions shall not include any amount that is also an
Equity Contribution;

(14) (i) the declaration and payment of dividends to holders of any class or series of
Designated Preference Shares of the Parent issued after the Issue Date; and (ii) the
declaration and payment of dividends to any Holding Entity or any Affiliate thereof,
the proceeds of which will be used to fund the payment of dividends to holders of
any class or series of Designated Preference Shares of such Holding Entity or
Affiliate issued after the Issue Date; provided, however, that, in the case of subclauses (i) and (ii), the amount of all dividends declared or paid pursuant to this
clause (14) shall not exceed the Net Cash Proceeds received by the Parent or the
aggregate amount contributed in cash to the equity (other than the Equity
Contribution or through the issuance of Disqualified Stock, Excluded Amounts or
an Excluded Contribution or, in the case of Designated Preference Shares by a
Holding Entity or an Affiliate the issuance of Designated Preference Shares) of the


-----

Parent or loaned or contributed as Subordinated Shareholder Funding to the Parent,
from the issuance or sale of such Designated Preference Shares;

(15) dividends or other distributions of Capital Stock, Indebtedness or other securities

Financing.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on

the date of such Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or
issued by the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted
Payment. The fair market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount. Any
amounts (such amounts, the “Excluded Amounts”) that would otherwise be included in the
calculation of the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to sub-clauses (ii) or (iii) of
clause (c) of the first paragraph of this covenant will be excluded to the extent (1) such amounts
result from the receipt of Net Cash Proceeds, property or assets or marketable securities received
in contemplation of, or in connection with, an event that would otherwise constitute a Change of
Control pursuant to the definition thereof were it not a Specified Change of Control Event, (2) the
purpose of, or the effect of, the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, property or assets or marketable
securities was to reduce the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of the Company so that there would be
an occurrence of a Specified Change of Control Event that would not have been achieved without
the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, property or assets or marketable securities and (3) no
Change of Control Offer is made in connection with such event in accordance with the
requirements of the indenture.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly,

create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock
of a Restricted Subsidiary), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any
interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such
Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute
Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if,
subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes (or a Note Guarantee in the case of Liens of a
Guarantor) are secured equally and ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to
Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such
Indebtedness is so secured (provided that a Lien to secure Indebtedness pursuant to clauses (1) or
(6) of such second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” may
have priority not materially less favorable to the Holders than that accorded to the Revolving
Facilities under the Intercreditor Agreement), and (b) in the case of any property or assets that
constitute Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes pursuant to sub-clause (a)(2) of the preceding

paragraph will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release


-----

and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “Security—
_Release of Liens.”_

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such

Indebtedness at the time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted
to secure any Increased Amount of such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any
Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such Indebtedness in connection with any
accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original issue discount, the
payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of
original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the
value of property securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise

cause or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction
on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital
Stock to the Parent or the Issuer or pay any Indebtedness or other obligations owed
to the Parent or the Issuer;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Parent or the Issuer; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Parent or the Issuer;

_provided_ that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating
distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y)
the subordination of (including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances
made to the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Parent or
any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (or any guarantee
or security granted in connection therewith), including the Revolving Facilities
Agreement, (b) the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees or the Proceeds Loan
Agreement, (c) the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or the Transaction Security Documents or (d) any other agreement or
instrument in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date, including, in each case,
any amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings,
replacements or refinancings, _provided_ that the amendments, restatements,
modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are
not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to such dividend and
other payment restrictions than those contained in those agreements referred to in
sub-clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d) above, as applicable (as determined in good faith
by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent);


-----

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person
or relating to any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or
before the date on which such Person was acquired by or merged, consolidated or

designated as a Restricted Subsidiary, or on which such agreement or instrument is
assumed by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an

consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such
Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Parent or was
merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Parent or any
Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in connection with such transaction) and
outstanding on such date; _provided_ that, for the purposes of this clause (2), if
another Person is the Successor Company, any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or
instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or
assumed by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the
Successor Company;

clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any amendment, supplement or
other modification to an agreement referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph
or this clause (3); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with
respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or
instrument are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a
whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or
Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other
modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an
Officer of the Parent) or that the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent
determines when such Indebtedness is Incurred that such encumbrances or
restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Parent’s ability to
make principal or interest payments on the Notes;

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer
of any property or asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract,
or the assignment or transfer of any lease, license or other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements

interests set forth in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Parent or
any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and
Capitalized Lease Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that
impose encumbrances or restrictions on the property so acquired or any

agreements and instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business or
consistent with industry practices;

relating to any Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date
pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such_
agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Holders than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Revolving
Facilities Agreement, together with the security documents associated therewith or
(ii) in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors
or an Officer of the Parent) and where, in the case of clause (ii), the Parent
determines at the time such Indebtedness is Incurred that such encumbrances or
restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability to
make principal or interest payments on the Notes;

(12) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any Lien permitted by the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens”; or


-----

(13) restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing that, in
the good faith determination of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent,
are necessary or advisable to effect such Qualified Receivables Financing.

**_Limitation on sales of assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any

Asset Disposition unless:

(1) the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration
(including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility
for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value
(such fair market value to be determined on the date of contractually agreeing to
such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or
an Officer of the Parent, of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted
Asset Swap); and

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the
extent the Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75% of the
consideration from such Asset Disposition (excluding any consideration by way of
relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities,
contingent or otherwise, other than Indebtedness) received by the Parent or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash, Cash Equivalents
or Temporary Cash Investments.

Within 365 days from the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt

of such Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition, the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary,
as the case may be, may apply an amount equal to such Net Available Cash at the option of the
Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary:

(a) (1) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Senior Secured Indebtedness
(including Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1) and (14) of the second paragraph
of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or any Refinancing
Indebtedness in respect thereof); provided, however, that in connection with any
prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption of Indebtedness pursuant to this
sub-clause (1) (except in the case of any revolving Indebtedness, including but not
limited to the Revolving Facilities Agreement), the Parent or such Restricted
Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment to
be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid,
repaid, purchased or redeemed; _provided, further, that in the case of the_
prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption of Senior Secured Indebtedness
other than the Revolving Facilities, the Issuer shall prepay, repay, purchase or
redeem the Notes on a pro rata basis with such other Senior Secured Indebtedness;
(2) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor (other than Indebtedness owed to
the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary); or (3) in the case of an Asset Disposition


-----

that does not constitute Collateral, to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (I) Pari
Passu Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness owed to the Parent or a Restricted
Subsidiary) (i) at a price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari
Passu Indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment,
repayment, purchase or redemption, (ii) through repurchase of such Pari Passu
Indebtedness in the open market or (iii) pursuant to the contractual optional
redemption provisions applicable thereto or (II) Senior Indebtedness (other than
Indebtedness owed to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary) (i) at a price of no more
than 100% of the principal amount of such Senior Indebtedness plus accrued and
unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption,
(ii) through repurchase of such Senior Indebtedness in the open market or (iii)
pursuant to the contractual optional redemption provisions applicable thereto;
_provided that in the case of the prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption of_
Pari Passu Indebtedness or Senior Indebtedness (in each case, other than the Notes)
pursuant to sub-clause (3), the Issuer shall prepay, repay, purchase or redeem the
Notes on a pro rata basis with such other Indebtedness;

(b) to the extent the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit
to invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional
Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary with Net Available Cash received by the Parent
or a Restricted Subsidiary) within 365 days from the later of (i) the date of such
Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; _provided,_
_however, that any such reinvestment in Additional Assets made pursuant to a_
definitive binding agreement or a commitment approved by the Board of Directors
or an Officer of the Parent that is executed or approved within such time will satisfy
this requirement, so long as such investment is consummated within 180 days of
such 365th day;

(c) to make a capital expenditure pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or a
commitment approved by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent;
_provided, however, that any such capital expenditure made that is executed or_
approved within such time will only satisfy this requirement so long as such
investment is consummated within 180 days of such 365th day;

(d) to make Restricted Payments pursuant to clause (11) of the third paragraph of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payment” with the Net
Available Cash from Asset Dispositions; or

(e) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that, pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with_
clause (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) above, the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily
reduce Indebtedness or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by
the Indenture.

If an amount less than the Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions is applied or

invested or committed to be applied or invested, or offered to be applied or invested, as provided


-----

in the preceding paragraph, an amount equal to the difference will be deemed to constitute “Excess
_Proceeds” under the Indenture. On the 366th day (or the 546th day, in the case of any Net Available_
Cash committed to be used pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or commitment approved
by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent pursuant to clauses (b) or (c) of the second
paragraph of this covenant) after the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the
receipt of such Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition, or at such earlier date that the Parent
elects, if the aggregate amount of “Excess Proceeds” under the Indenture exceeds the greater of
£11 million and 6% of Consolidated EBITDA, the Parent will be required to make an offer (or
procure an offer is made) (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders of Notes issued under the
Indenture and, to the extent the Parent so elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu
Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of Notes and any such Pari
Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the
“Excess Proceeds,” at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case
of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of
such Notes and 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as
applicable.

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so

validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than
the “Excess Proceeds,” the Parent may use any remaining “Excess Proceeds” for general corporate
purposes, subject to the other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu
Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of “Excess
_Proceeds,” the “Excess Proceeds” shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness_
to be purchased on a pro rata basis or by use of a pool factor on the basis of the aggregate principal
amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness, or by such other method as (i) the Trustee
and (ii) the trustee, agent or similar representative of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, after
consultation with the Parent, deem fair and appropriate (and in such manner as complies with
applicable legal, depositary and exchange requirements). For the purposes of calculating the
aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in pound sterling or euro,
as the case may be based on the denomination of the applicable Notes, such Indebtedness shall be
calculated by converting any such aggregate principal amounts into their Sterling Equivalent or
Euro Equivalent, as the case may be, determined as of a date selected by the Parent that is within
the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined herein). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition
Offer, the amount of “Excess Proceeds” shall be reset at zero.

Any Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes pursuant to this covenant will be

allocated between the Euro Notes and the Sterling Notes in proportion to the respective aggregate
principal amounts of Euro Notes and Sterling Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is

denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated,
the amount thereof payable in respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in
the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated that is actually received upon converting
such portion of Net Available Cash into such currency.


-----

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a

period of not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition
_Offer Period”). No later than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition_
Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase Date”), the Parent will purchase (or procure the
purchase of) the aggregate principal amount of Notes and, to the extent they so elect, any Pari
Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition
_Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered,_
all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Parent will, to the extent lawful,

accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount
of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the
Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes
and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and, in the case of
the Notes, in minimum denominations of £100,000 or €100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000
or €1,000 in excess thereof, as the case may be. The Parent will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment in accordance
with the terms of this covenant. The Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly
(but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer
Period) mail or deliver (or procure the mail or delivery) to each tendering Holder an amount equal
to the purchase price of the Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder,
and accepted for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the Global
Note), and the Trustee, upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will (via an
authenticating agent) authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry)
such new Note to such Holder, in an aggregate principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion
of the Note surrendered; provided that each such new Note will be in an aggregate principal amount
with a minimum denomination of £100,000 or €100,000 or in integral multiples of £1,000 or
€1,000 in excess thereof, as the case may be. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed
or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Parent or the Issuer to the Holder thereof.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be

deemed to be cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness of the Parent or Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a
Guarantor) and the release of the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary from all
liability on such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary from the transferee that are converted by the Parent or such Restricted
Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of
such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary
as a result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Parent and each other


-----

Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of such
Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary
(other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor) received after
the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary;
and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken
together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to
this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of £11 million
and 6% of Consolidated EBITDA (with the fair market value of each item of
Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and
without giving effect to subsequent changes in value).

The Parent will comply (or procure compliance), to the extent applicable, with the

requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in
connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To the extent that the provisions
of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of this covenant,
the Parent will comply (or procure compliance) with the applicable securities laws and regulations
and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of any
conflict.

**_Maintenance of Listing_**

The Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing

of the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange for so long as such Notes are outstanding;
_provided that if the Parent is unable to obtain admission to such listing or if at any time the Parent_
determines that it will not maintain such listing, it will obtain and thereafter use its commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain a listing of such Notes on another stock exchange deemed
appropriate by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or

indirectly, enter into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the
purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate
of the Parent (such transaction or series of related transactions, an “Affiliate Transaction”)
involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of £10 million and 6% of Consolidated EBITDA
unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less
favorable to the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those
that could be obtained in a comparable transaction at the time of such transaction
or the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction in arm’s length
dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and


-----

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the
greater of £30 million and 17% of Consolidated EBITDA, the terms of such
transaction or series of related transactions have been approved by a majority of the
members of the Board of Directors of the Parent resolving that such transaction
complies with clause (1) above.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments,” any Permitted Payments (other than
pursuant to sub-clause (9)(b)(ii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”) or any Permitted Investment;

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other
securities, or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise
pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering into, or maintenance of, any employment,
consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation
arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the
Parent, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Holding Entity, restricted stock plans,
long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or
similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation, health,
insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or similar plans,
programs or arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of officers,
employees, directors or consultants approved by the Board of Directors of the
Parent, in each case in the ordinary course of business;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto and
any transaction pursuant to or in connection with an MEP, incentive scheme,
deferred compensation or similar arrangement (including any MEP Payment);

(4) any transaction between or among the Parent and any Restricted Subsidiary (or
entity that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or
between or among Restricted Subsidiaries or any Receivables Subsidiary;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary
indemnities (including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit
and pension expenses provided on behalf of, directors, officers, consultants or
employees of the Parent, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Holding Entity (whether
directly or indirectly and including through any Person owned or controlled by any
of such directors, officers or employees);

(6) the Transactions and the entry into and performance of obligations of the Parent or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction arising out of,
and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or
instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date, as these agreements and instruments
may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed, replaced or


-----

refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or
to the extent not materially more disadvantageous to the Holders taken as a whole
in the good faith judgment of an Officer of the Parent and the entry into and
performance of any registration rights or other listing agreement in connection with
any Public Offering;

(7) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement (including
any transactions which are entered into with any Holding Entity or Unrestricted
Subsidiary in order to satisfy the obligations arising under any Tax Sharing
Agreement) and the formation and maintenance of any consolidated group for tax,
accounting or cash pooling or management purposes in the ordinary course of
business;

(8) any payments arising on the exercise of any put or call options (or any equivalent
right or obligation) in relation to any Associate or transactions with customers,
clients, landlords, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, which, in
each case, are in the ordinary course of business and are either fair to the Parent or
the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of
Directors or an Officer of the Parent or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary or are on
terms no less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such
time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Parent or
any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Parent or an Associate or similar
entity that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the Parent or a
Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary or
any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in or otherwise
controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;

(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated
Preference Shares) of the Parent or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such
Capital Stock or Subordinated Shareholder Funding; provided that the interest rate
and other financial terms of such Subordinated Shareholder Funding are approved
by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent
in their reasonable determination, (b) any amendment, waiver or other transaction
with respect to any Subordinated Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other
provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable and (c) directors’ qualifying shares and
shares issued to foreign nationals as required by applicable law;

(11) without duplication in respect of payments made pursuant to clause (12) below, (a)
payments by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder
(whether directly or indirectly, including through any Holding Entity) of annual
management, consulting, monitoring or advisory fees and related expenses in an
aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of £4 million and 2% of Consolidated
EBITDA in each twelve month period commencing on the Issue Date, and (b)
customary payments by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted


-----

Holder (whether directly or indirectly, including through any Holding Entity) for
financial advisory, consulting, financing, underwriting or placement services or in
respect of other investment banking activities, including in connection with
acquisitions or divestitures, which payments in respect of this sub-clause (b) are
approved by a majority of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent in good
faith;

(12) payment to any Permitted Holder of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses Incurred
by such Permitted Holder in connection with its direct or indirect investment in the
Parent and its Subsidiaries;

(13) any transaction effected pursuant to or in connection with a Qualified Receivables
Financing; and

(14) any transaction as to which the Parent delivers to the Trustee a written opinion from
an Independent Financial Advisor stating that the transaction (a) is fair to the Parent
and its Restricted Subsidiaries from a financial point of view, or (b) meets the
requirements of clause (1) of the first paragraph of this covenant.

**_Reports_**

For so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Parent will provide to the Trustee the

following reports:

(1) within 120 days (or, in the case of the first fiscal year ending after the Issue Date,
150 days) after the end of the Parent’s fiscal year, beginning with the first trading
year ending after the Issue Date, annual reports containing, to the extent applicable,
the following information: (a) audited consolidated balance sheets of the Parent as
of the end of the two most recent fiscal years and audited consolidated income
statements and statements of cash flow of the Parent for the two most recent fiscal
years, including complete footnotes to such financial statements and the report of
the independent auditors on the financial statements; (b) unaudited pro forma
income statement information and balance sheet information of the Parent (which,
for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the provision of a full income statement
or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available), together with explanatory
footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have
occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year (and which
have not already been the subject of pro forma information provided by the Parent);
(c) an operating and financial review of the audited financial statements, including
a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital
resources of the Parent, and a discussion of material commitments and
contingencies and critical accounting policies; (d) a description of the business,
management and shareholders of the Parent, all material affiliate transactions and
a description of all material contractual arrangements, including material debt
instruments; and (e) a description of material risk factors and material recent
developments;


-----

(2) within 75 days following the end of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year
of the Parent (or, in the case of the second and third fiscal quarters in 2021, 90
days), all quarterly reports of the Parent containing the following information: (a)
an unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of the end of such fiscal
quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most
recently completed fiscal quarter year-to-date period ending on the unaudited
condensed balance sheet date, and the comparable prior year periods, together with
condensed footnote disclosure; (b) unaudited pro forma income statement
information and balance sheet information of the Parent (which, for the avoidance
of doubt, shall not include the provision of a full income statement or balance sheet
to the extent not reasonably available), together with explanatory footnotes, for any
material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the
beginning of the relevant fiscal quarter (and which have not already been the subject
of pro forma information provided by the Parent); (c) an operating and financial
review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the results
of operations, financial condition and material changes in liquidity and capital
resources of the Parent, and a discussion of material changes not in the ordinary
course of business in commitments and contingencies since the most recent report;
and (d) material recent developments; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition, restructuring,
merger or similar transaction, or any senior executive officer changes at the Parent
or change in auditors of the Parent or any other material event that the Parent
announces publicly, a report containing a description of such event.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect

on the date of such report or financial statement and on a consistent basis for the periods presented;
_provided, however, that in the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above, in the event of a_
change in applicable IFRS, earlier periods may be presented on a basis that applied to such periods.
Except as provided for below, no report need include separate financial statements for any
Subsidiaries of the Parent. At the Parent’s election it may also include financial statements of a
Holding Entity in lieu of those of the Parent; provided that, if the financial statements of a Holding
Entity are included in such report, a reasonably detailed description of material differences
between the financial statements of the Holding Entity and the Parent shall be included for any
period after the Issue Date. Following an Initial Public Offering of the Capital Stock of an IPO
Entity and/or the listing of such Capital Stock on a recognized stock exchange, the requirements
of clauses (1), (2) and (3) above shall be considered to have been fulfilled if the IPO Entity
complies with the reporting requirements of such stock exchange.

At any time that any of the Parent’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such

Unrestricted Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary,
constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the Parent, then the annual and quarterly financial
information required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant shall include
either (i) a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the
footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Parent and its Restricted
Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted
Subsidiaries of the Parent or (ii) stand-alone audited or unaudited financial statements, as the case


-----

may be, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as a group or otherwise)
together with an unaudited reconciliation to the financial information of the Parent and its
Subsidiaries, which reconciliation shall include the following items: revenue, finance costs,
profit/loss for the period, cash and cash equivalents, total assets, total liabilities, equity and capital
expenditures.

Substantially concurrently with the issuance to the Trustee of the reports specified in clause

(1), (2) and (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the Parent shall also (a) use its commercially
reasonable efforts (i) to post copies of such reports on such password protected website as may be
then maintained by the Parent and its Subsidiaries or (ii) otherwise to provide substantially
comparable public availability of such reports (as determined by the Board of Directors or an
Officer of the Parent in good faith) or (b) to the extent the Board of Directors or an Officer of the
Parent determines in good faith that it cannot make such reports available in the manner described
in the preceding clause (a) owing to applicable law or after the use of its commercially reasonable
efforts, furnish such reports to the Holders and, upon their request, prospective purchasers of the
Notes.

The Issuer will also make available copies of all reports required by clauses (1) through (3)

of the first paragraph of this covenant, if and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of
the Exchange, and if and to the extent the rules of the Exchange so require, at the offices of the
Listing Agent in Jersey.

In addition, so long as the Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which

the Parent is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant
to Rule 12g3-2(b), the Parent shall furnish to the Holders and, upon their request, prospective
purchasers of the Notes, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4)
under the Securities Act.

Delivery of any information, documents and reports to the Trustee pursuant to this section

is for information purposes and the Trustee’s receipt shall not constitute constructive notice of any
information contained therein, including the Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants under
the Indenture.

**_Merger and consolidation_**

_The Issuer and the Parent_

Neither the Issuer nor the Parent will consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey,

transfer or lease all or substantially all its assets to, any Person, unless (and subject to the other
terms of the Indenture):

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Company”) (if not the
Parent or the Issuer, as applicable) will be a Person organized and existing under
the laws of any Permissible Jurisdiction and the Successor Company (if not the
Parent or the Issuer, as applicable) will expressly assume (subject in each case to
any limitation contemplated by the Agreed Security Principles), (a) by
supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Parent or the Issuer, as


-----

applicable, under the Notes and the Indenture and (b) to the extent required by
applicable law to effect such assumption, all obligations of the Parent or the Issuer,
as applicable, under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction Security Documents;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness
that becomes an obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the
Successor Company as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the
Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default
or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) only in case of a transaction involving the Parent, immediately after giving effect
to such transaction, either (a) the Successor Company would be permitted to Incur
at least an additional £1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio for the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the most recently
ended four fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available
immediately preceding the date on which such transaction is consummated would
not be lower than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Parent shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate that such
consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) complies
with the Indenture, and that all conditions precedent provided for therein relating
to such transaction have been complied with or satisfied, and that the assumption
(if any) of obligations under clause (1) above constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Successor Company. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely
conclusively on such Officer’s Certificate without independent verification.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary

(or that is deemed to be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and
any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in
compliance with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other

disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the
Parent, which properties and assets, if held by the Parent instead of such Subsidiaries, would
constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Parent on a consolidated basis,
shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the
Parent, as the case may be.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every

right and power of, the Parent under the Indenture and the Notes but in the case of a lease of all or
substantially all its assets, the predecessor company will not be released from its obligations under
the Indenture or the Notes.


-----

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) and the provisions described below

under “—Subsidiary Guarantors” (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence),
(a) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer
all or part of its properties and assets to the Parent and (b) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a
Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its
properties and assets to any other Restricted Subsidiary. Notwithstanding the preceding clauses
(2) and (3) (which do not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), the Parent may
consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the
purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Parent, reincorporating the Parent in another
jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Parent.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable

law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph

of this covenant) will not apply to (i) any transactions which constitute an Asset Disposition if the
Parent has complied with the covenant described under “—Limitation on sales of assets and
_Subsidiary stock” or (ii) the creation of a new subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary._

_Subsidiary Guarantors_

No Subsidiary Guarantor may (other than a Subsidiary Guarantor whose guarantee is to be

released in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement):

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person;

(2) sell, convey, transfer or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or
substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to
any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into such Subsidiary Guarantor,

unless

(A) the other Person is the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a
Guarantor or becomes a Guarantor; or

(B) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting,
surviving or transferee Person expressly assumes (in each case, subject to
any limitation contemplated by the Agreed Security Principles) all of the
obligations of the Guarantor under its Note Guarantee and, to the extent
required by applicable law to effect such assumption, the obligations under
the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and
the Transaction Security Documents to which it is a party, in each case,
subject to any limitation contemplated by the Agreed Security Principles;


-----

and (2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default has
occurred and is continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of
consolidation or merger) of the Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or
substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (in each case other than to the
Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the preceding sub-clause (B) and the provisions described under “—The

_Issuer and the Parent” (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence), (a) any_
Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part
of its properties and assets to a Subsidiary Guarantor and (b) if there is more than one Subsidiary
Guarantor, any Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or
transfer all or part of their respective properties and assets to any other Subsidiary Guarantor, as
the case may be. Notwithstanding the preceding sub-clause (B)(2) (which does not apply to the
transactions referred to in this sentence), a Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise
combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the
legal domicile of the Subsidiary Guarantor reincorporating such Subsidiary Guarantor in another
jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such Subsidiary Guarantor, as the case may be.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable

law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

**_Suspension of covenants on achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status

and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then,
beginning on that day and continuing until the Reversion Date, the provisions of the Indenture
summarized under the following captions will not apply to such Notes: “—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments,” “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from_
_Restricted Subsidiaries,” “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions,” “—Limitation on sales of assets_
_and Subsidiary stock,” “—Additional Note Guarantees and Collateral” and the provisions of_
clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger and consolidation—
_The Issuer and the Parent,” (together, the “Suspended Covenants”) and, in each case, any related_
default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Parent
and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply
according to their terms from the first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect.
Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Parent or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and the
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since
the date of the Indenture except that no Default will be deemed to have occurred solely by reason
of a Restricted Payment made while that covenant was suspended. On the Reversion Date, all
Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be classified, at the
Parent’s option, as having been Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or one of the clauses set forth in the second paragraph of
such covenant, to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be Incurred thereunder as of


-----

the Reversion Date and after giving effect to Indebtedness Incurred prior to the Suspension Event
and outstanding on the Reversion Date. To the extent such Indebtedness would not be so permitted
to be Incurred under the first two paragraphs of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness,” such Indebtedness will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so_
that it is classified as permitted under sub-clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

In addition, on the Reversion Date, (1) any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the

Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during the continuance of the Suspension
Event shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (6) of the second paragraph of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions” and (2) any encumbrance or
restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in clauses (A)
through (C) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restrictions
_on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during the continuance of_
the Suspension Event shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to sub-clause 1(d) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from
_Restricted Subsidiaries.”_

The Parent shall notify the Trustee that the conditions under this covenant have been

satisfied, although such notification shall not be a condition for the suspension of the Suspended
Covenants. The Trustee shall not be obliged to notify Holders of any Suspension Event or
Reversion Date.

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants shall be reinstated on and from the

Reversion Date, no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist under
the Indenture with respect to the Suspended Covenants, and none of the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for any actions taken or events occurring during the
continuance of the Suspension Event, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual
obligation arising during the continuance of the Suspension Event, in each case, as a result of a
failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the continuance of the Suspension Event
(or, upon termination of the Suspension Event or after that time based solely on any action taken
or event that occurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event), and following a Reversion
Date, the Parent and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing a Default or
Event of Default, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or
obligations arising during the continuance of any Suspension Event to the extent that such
contractual commitments or obligations are permitted or not prohibited under the Indenture, and
to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

**_Financial calculations_**

When calculating the satisfaction of or availability under any Applicable Metric in the

Indenture in connection with any Applicable Transaction, the date of determination of such
Applicable Metric shall, at the option of the Parent, be any Applicable Test Date. If the Parent
elects to determine any Applicable Metric as of any Applicable Test Date, it shall give pro forma
effect to any other Applicable Transactions that have occurred up to (and including) such
Applicable Test Date; provided that the pro forma calculation may exclude any non-recurring fees,
costs and expenses attributable to any Applicable Transaction.


-----

If compliance with an Applicable Metric is established in accordance with the prior

paragraph, such Applicable Metric shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for
all purposes; _provided that (1) the Parent may elect, in its sole discretion, to recalculate any_
Applicable Metric on the basis of a more recent Applicable Test Date, in which case, such date of
redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the relevant Applicable Test Date for purposes of
such Applicable Metrics; and (2) save as contemplated in clause (1) above, compliance with any
Applicable Metric shall not be determined or tested at any time after the relevant Applicable Test
Date for such transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto.

If any Applicable Metric for which compliance was determined or tested as of an

Applicable Test Date would at any time after the Applicable Test Date have been exceeded or
otherwise failed to have been complied with as a result of fluctuations in such Applicable Metric
(or any other Applicable Metric), such Applicable Metric will not be deemed to have been
exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations.

If any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing

Default or Event of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of
the Applicable Test Date would at any time after the Applicable Test Date not have been complied
with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence or continuation of a Default or an Event of
Default), such requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied
with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be
continuing).

If an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) is committed, incurred or issued, any

Lien is committed or incurred or any other transaction is undertaken or any Applicable Metric is
tested in reliance on a ratio-based basket based on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Leverage Ratio or any other ratio
based Applicable Metric (other than a calculation made for the purposes of making a Restricted
Payment in compliance with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments”), such ratios shall be calculated without regard to the Incurrence of any Indebtedness_
to finance the working capital needs of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries under any
revolving facility, letter of credit facility or bank guarantee facility and/or other debt which is
available to be re-drawn (including the Revolving Facilities, any guarantee facility or any ancillary
facility under the Revolving Facilities Agreement) and, for the avoidance of doubt, any undrawn
commitments for Indebtedness (including under a revolving facility or guarantee facility) shall be
disregarded for the purposes of testing the Applicable Metric.

If a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) is incurred or

entered into pursuant to a numerical permission and at a later time would subsequently be
permitted under a ratio-based permission, unless otherwise elected by the Parent, such action,
matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such ratiobased permission.

For any relevant Applicable Metric set by reference to a fiscal year, a calendar year, a four
quarter period or any other similar annual period (each an “Annual Period”):


-----

(a) at the option of the Parent, the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable

Metric during such Annual Period may be increased by: (A) an amount equal to 100% of the
difference (if positive) between the permitted amount in the immediately preceding Annual Period
and the amount thereof actually used or applied by the Restricted Group during such preceding
Annual Period (the “Carry Forward Amount”); and/or (B) an amount equal to 100% of the
permitted amount in the immediately following Annual Period and the permitted amount in such
immediately following Annual Period shall be reduced by such corresponding amount (the “Carry
_Back Amount”); and_

(b) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric

during such Annual Period is increased in accordance with clause (a) of this paragraph, any usage
of such Applicable Metric during such Annual Period shall be deemed to be applied in the
following order: (A) first, against the Carry Forward Amount; (B) second, against the maximum
amount so permitted during such Annual Period prior to any increase in accordance with clause
(a) of this paragraph; and (C) third, against the Carry Back Amount.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indenture, when calculating any financial

definition or ratio under the Indenture, the Parent shall be permitted to exclude all or any part of
any expenditure or other negative item (and/or the impact thereof) directly or indirectly relating to
or resulting from (1) the Transactions; (2) any other acquisition, Investment or other joint venture
permitted by the terms of the Indenture or the impact from purchase price accounting; (3) start-up
costs for new businesses or sites and branding or re-branding of existing businesses; and/or (4)
costs or expenses relating to employee relocation, retraining, severance and termination, business
interruption, reorganization and other restructuring or cost cutting measures, the rationalization,
re-branding, start up, reduction or elimination of product lines, assets, sites or businesses, the
consolidation, relocation or closure of sites or administrative locations and other similar items (for
the avoidance of doubt, excluding any related capital expenditure).

**_Additional Note Guarantees and Collateral_**

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional

Intercreditor Agreement, the Parent will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that
are not Guarantors or the Issuer, directly or indirectly, to Guarantee any Indebtedness under the
Revolving Facilities Agreement (or other Indebtedness that is Incurred under clause (1) of the
second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”) or any Public
Debt exceeding £20 million in principal amount, in whole or in part unless, in each case, such
Restricted Subsidiary becomes a Guarantor on the date on which such other Guarantee is Incurred
and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form
attached to the Indenture or other appropriate agreement pursuant to which such Restricted
Subsidiary will provide a Guarantee on the same terms and conditions as those set forth in the
Indenture, which Guarantee will be senior to or _pari passu_ with such Restricted Subsidiary’s
Guarantee of such other Indebtedness.

A Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor may become a Guarantor if it executes and

delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to
which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Guarantee.


-----

Following the provision of any additional Guarantees as described above, subject to the

Agreed Security Principles, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (if such security is being granted in respect of the other Indebtedness), any such
Guarantor will provide security over certain of its material assets (excluding any assets of such
Guarantor which are subject to a Permitted Lien at the time of the execution of such supplemental
indenture if providing such security interest would not be permitted by the terms of such Permitted
Lien or by the terms of any obligations secured by such Permitted Lien) to secure its Guarantee on
a first priority basis consistent with the security agreements related to the existing Collateral. Each
additional Guarantee or security will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses
generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer,
voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, thin capitalization, distributable
reserves, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of
creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraphs, the Parent will not be obligated to cause such

Restricted Subsidiary to Guarantee the Notes or provide security to the extent and for so long as
the Incurrence of such Guarantee could or the grant of such security would be inconsistent with
the Intercreditor Agreement or the Agreed Security Principles.

**_Impairment of security interest_**

The Parent and TopCo shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take

any action, which action would have the result of materially impairing the security interest with
respect to the Collateral (it being understood that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens, or
the confirmation or affirmation of security interests in respect of the Collateral, shall under no
circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security interest with respect to the Collateral)
for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Parent and TopCo shall not, and shall not
permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the
benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Transaction
Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any
Lien over any of the Collateral that is prohibited by the covenant entitled “—Limitation on Liens”;
_provided that the Parent, its Restricted Subsidiaries and TopCo may Incur any Lien over any of_
the Collateral that is not prohibited by the covenant entitled “—Limitation on Liens,” including
Permitted Collateral Liens, and the Collateral may be discharged, transferred or released in any
circumstances not prohibited by the Indenture, the applicable Transaction Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing in this covenant shall restrict the discharge and release

of any Lien in accordance with the Indenture, the applicable Transaction Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

Subject to the foregoing, the Transaction Security Documents may be amended, extended,

renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or released to (i) cure any ambiguity,
omission, defect or inconsistency therein; (ii) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens; (iii) add to
the Collateral; or (iv) make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the Holders in
any material respect; _provided, however, that (except where permitted by the Indenture or the_
Intercreditor Agreement or to effect or facilitate the creation of Permitted Collateral Liens for the


-----

benefit of the Security Agent and the holders of other Indebtedness Incurred in accordance with
the Indenture) no Transaction Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated
or otherwise modified or released unless contemporaneously with such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement or modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at
least equivalent ranking over the same assets), the Parent delivers to the Security Agent and the
Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Security
Agent and the Trustee, from an Independent Financial Advisor or appraiser or investment bank
which confirms the solvency of the Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect
to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, modification or
release, (2) a certificate from an Officer of the relevant Person which confirms the solvency of the
Person granting such Lien after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a
Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), or (3) an Opinion of Counsel (subject to
any qualifications customary for this type of opinion of counsel), in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee and the Security Agent, confirming that, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, modification or release
(followed by an immediate retaking of a lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets),
the Lien or Liens created under the Transaction Security Document, so amended, extended,
renewed, restated, modified or released and replaced are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise
subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien
or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, modification or release and replacement and to which the new Indebtedness secured
by the Permitted Collateral Lien is not subject. In the event that the Parent, its Restricted
Subsidiaries and TopCo comply with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the
Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such
actions without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**_Further Assurances_**

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Parent, its Restricted Subsidiaries and TopCo

will, at their own expense, execute and do all such acts and things and provide such assurances as
the Security Agent may reasonably require (i) for registering any Transaction Security Documents
in any required register and for perfecting or protecting the security intended to be afforded by
such Transaction Security Documents and (ii) if such Transaction Security Documents have
become enforceable, for facilitating the realization of all or any part of the assets which are subject
to such Transaction Security Documents and for facilitating the exercise of all powers, authorities
and discretions vested in the Security Agent or in any receiver of all or any part of those assets.
Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Parent, its Restricted Subsidiaries and TopCo will
execute all transfers, conveyances, assignments and releases of that property whether to the
Security Agent or to its nominees and give all notices, orders and directions which the Security
Agent may reasonably request.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:


-----

(1) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note when
due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note
issued under the Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional
redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure to comply for 30 days after written notice by the Trustee on behalf of the
Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes with any of the Issuer’s obligations under the covenants
described under “—Change of Control” above or the obligations of the Parent and
the Restricted Subsidiaries under the covenants described under “—Certain
_covenants” above (in each case, other than a failure to purchase Notes which will_
constitute an Event of Default under clause (2) above);

(4) failure by the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days
after written notice by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at
least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes with the Issuer’s
or the Guarantors’ other agreements contained in the Indenture;

(5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be
issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money
borrowed by the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of
which is Guaranteed by the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) other than
Indebtedness owed to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such
Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which
default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at Stated Maturity on such
Indebtedness, immediately upon the expiration of the grace period provided
in such Indebtedness (“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the
“cross acceleration provision”);

and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness,
together with the aggregate principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under
which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has been so
accelerated, aggregates £30 million or more;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer, the
Parent, TopCo, or a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that,
taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the
Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary
(the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(7) failure by the Issuer, the Parent, a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted
Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial


-----

statements for the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary, to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of £30 million
(exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged
liability for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60
days after the judgment becomes final and due (the “judgment default provision”);

(8) any security interest under the Transaction Security Documents on any material
Collateral having a fair market value in excess of £30 million shall, at any time,
cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the
relevant Transaction Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) for any reason other than the
satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release or
amendment of any such security interest in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or
such Transaction Security Document or any such security interest created
thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable in a final non-appealable
decision of a court of competent jurisdiction or the Issuer shall assert in writing that
any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default
continues for 10 days (the “security default provisions”); and

(9) any Note Guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance
with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture), or a Guarantor
denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Note Guarantee in writing, other than
in accordance with the terms thereof or upon release of the Note Guarantee in
accordance with the Indenture.

However, a default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of this paragraph will not constitute an

Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of
the outstanding Notes notify the Parent of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4), (5) and
(7), the Parent does not cure such default (or arranges for such default to be cured) within the time
specified in clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (6) above) occurs

and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Parent, or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Parent and the Trustee, may,
and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and
accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Notes to be due and
payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest,
including Additional Amounts, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a
declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (5) of this
“Events of Default” section has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the
Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such
Event of Default pursuant to clause (5) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the
Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been
discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if
(1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree
of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of


-----

principal, premium or interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes that became
due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (6) above occurs and is continuing, the principal

of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all
the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act
on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes under

the Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to
(i) nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, or Additional Amounts, if any and (ii) a covenant
or provision which under the Indenture cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the
Holders of at least 90% of the principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, each of which may
only be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least 90% of the principal amount of the Notes
then outstanding) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its
consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event

of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the
rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such
Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security (including by way of prefunding)
satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to
receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect
to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default
is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes
have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing the Trustee indemnity and/or security
(including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss,
liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of
the offer of security and/or indemnity (including by way of prefunding); and

(5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes
have not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is
inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of

the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power
conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing and a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the


-----

Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person
would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any
direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly
prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability.
Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or
security (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to it against all losses and expenses caused
by taking or not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and a responsible

officer of the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Parent, the Trustee must give notice
of the Default to the Holders within 90 days after being notified by the Parent. The Parent will be
required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days (or, in the case of the first fiscal year ending
after the Issue Date, 150 days) after the end of each fiscal year, a certificate signed by an authorized
representative of the Parent indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that
occurred during the previous year. The Parent will be required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30
days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would
constitute a Default or an Event of Default, their status and what action the Parent is taking or
proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain

circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured (including by way of
prefunding) to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in
relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take
action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action
directly.

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as will be provided in the

Indenture and may not enforce the Transaction Security Documents except as will be provided in
such Transaction Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

**Amendments and waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Note Documents may be amended, supplemented or

otherwise modified with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender
offer or exchange offer for, such Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or
compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained
in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes); provided that
(i) if any amendment, waiver or other modification will only amend one series of the Notes, only
the consent of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series
shall be required and (ii) if any amendment, waiver or other modification will only affect the Euro
Notes or the Sterling Notes, only the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the then outstanding Euro Notes or Sterling Notes (and not the consent of at
least a majority of all Notes then outstanding), as the case may be, shall be required. However,
without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clauses (8) and (9),


-----

75%) of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of Notes affected (including consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for the Notes), an
amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any such series of the Notes held by a nonconsenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an
amendment, waiver or modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any
such Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the
time at which any such Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above
under “—Optional Redemption” or “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons”;

(5) make any such Note payable in money other than that stated in such Note;

(6) amend the contractual right of any Holder to institute suit for the payment of
principal or interest on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes on or after the due
dates thereof;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Additional
_Amounts” that adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any_
material respect or amends the terms of such Notes in a way that would result in a
loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption
from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the
Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release all or substantially all the Guarantors from their obligations under their
respective Note Guarantees or the Indenture, except otherwise in accordance with
the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(9) release the security interest granted for the benefit of the Holders in the material
Collateral, other than pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Security Document
or the Indenture, as applicable, except as permitted by the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(10) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal,
premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes (except pursuant to
a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in
aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment default that
resulted from such acceleration); or


-----

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the
Holders’ consent holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (8) and (9),
75%) of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of such Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the

Guarantors, the Trustee and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any
Note Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency, conform any provision
of the Note Documents to the “Description of the Notes” contained in an Offering
Memorandum (to the extent such amendment or supplement is in respect of Note
Documents for a new series of Notes without affecting the Note Documents for
Notes already in issue), or reduce the minimum denomination of the Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or
the Guarantors under any Note Document;

(3) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes
(provided that the uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of
Section 163(f) of the Code, or in a manner such that the uncertificated Notes are
described in Section 4701(b)(1)(B) of the Code) or change the minimum
denominations for the Notes;

(4) add to the covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders
or surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer, the Parent or any
Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or
the Holders or does not adversely affect the rights of or benefits to the Trustee or
any Holder in any material respect;

(6) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors or an Officer of the Parent) for the issuance of Additional Notes;

(7) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee in accordance
with the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” and “—Certain covenants—Additional Note Guarantees and_
_Collateral” to add Note Guarantees, add security to or for the benefit of the Notes,_
or confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Note
Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Transaction Security
Documents) or any amendment in respect thereon with respect to or securing the
Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment is
permitted under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement or the Transaction Security Documents;

(8) [Intentionally Omitted];


-----

(9) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a
successor Trustee pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the
accession by the Trustee to any Note Document; or

(10) in the case of the Transaction Security Documents, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate
or grant a security interest in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of parties
to the Revolving Facilities Agreement in any property which is required by the
Revolving Facilities Agreement (in each case, as in effect on the Issue Date) to be
mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to
be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security
interest for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such security
interest is not prohibited by the Indenture and the covenant described under “—
_Certain covenants—Impairment of security interest” is complied with._

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to rely on such

evidence as it deems appropriate, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular

form of any proposed amendment of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves
the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the
Indenture by any Holder given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be
rendered invalid by such tender.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to

the extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any
amendment, supplement and waiver.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required aggregate principal amount of the Notes

have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, any Notes owned by the Issuer or by any
Person directly or indirectly controlled, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common
control with, the Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding (save as provided in
paragraph 9 of “—Change of Control”).

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all its, TopCo’s and each Guarantor’s obligations

under the Notes and the Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and
Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust,
the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of
the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes,
registrations of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office
or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if
the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Transaction Security Documents in effect at
such time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).


-----

The Issuer at any time may terminate all its, TopCo’s and each Guarantor’s obligations

under the covenants described under “—Certain covenants” (other than with respect to clauses (1)
and (2) of the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Merger and consolidation—The
_Issuer and the Parent” and the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Merger and_
_consolidation—Subsidiary Guarantors”) and “—Change of Control” and the default provisions_
relating to such covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross
default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions, the
judgment default provision, the guarantee default provision and the security default provision
described under “—Events of Default” above (“covenant defeasance”).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option

notwithstanding its prior exercise of the covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its
legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of
Default with respect to the Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with
respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default
specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described
under “—Certain covenants—Merger and consolidation” and the covenant described under “—
_Certain covenants—Merger and consolidation—Subsidiary Guarantors”), (4), (5), (6) (other than_
with respect to the Issuer and the Parent), (7), (8) or (9) under “—Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust

(the “defeasance trust”) with the Trustee (or such other entity designated or appointed as agent by
the Trustee for this purpose) (i) with respect to the Notes denominated in pound sterling, cash in
pound sterling, UK Government Obligations, or a combination of cash in pound sterling and UK
Government Obligations and (ii) with respect to the Notes denominated in euro, cash in euro, eurodenominated European Government Obligations or a combination of cash in euro and eurodenominated European Government Obligations, in each case, in such amounts as will be
sufficient, in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent, for
the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as
the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee
of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders will not
recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of
such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the
same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the
case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal
defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a
ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S.
federal income tax law since the Issue Date);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the
intent of defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of
the Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may
be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that that all


-----

conditions precedent provided for or relating to legal defeasance or covenant
defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with;

(4) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not
constitute, or is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S.
Investment Company Act of 1940; and

(5) all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably require
in connection with either defeasance option.

**Satisfaction and discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor

Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction Security Document will
be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of the Trustee and
conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as will be expressly provided for in the Indenture)
as to all outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and delivered
(other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes and certain Notes for which provision for
payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been
delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the
Paying Agent for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable
at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year
under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Paying Agent and the Trustee for the giving of
notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer
has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or such other entity designated or
appointed as agent by the Trustee for this purpose), (i) with respect to the Notes denominated in
pound sterling, cash in pound sterling, UK Government Obligations or a combination of cash in
pound sterling and UK Government Obligations and (ii) with respect to the Notes denominated in
euro, cash in euro, euro-denominated European Government Obligations, or a combination of cash
in euro and euro-denominated European Government Obligations, in each case, in an amount
sufficient, in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent to
pay and discharge the outstanding aggregate principal amount of indebtedness on the Notes not
previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and
interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the
Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid
all other sums payable under the Indenture; and (4) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each to the effect that all conditions precedent
under the “—Satisfaction and discharge” section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and
discharge of the Indenture have been complied with; provided that any such counsel may rely on
any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing
clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer, Topco or the

Parent, any of the Parent’s Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates, as such, shall have
any liability for any obligations of the Issuer, TopCo or the Guarantors under the Note Documents


-----

or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each
Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part
of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities
under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against
public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

GLAS Trust Company LLC will be the Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will

provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer
of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth
specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible
officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and
powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person
would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain
from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture is not to be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become

a creditor of the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain
property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee is permitted
to engage in other transactions with the Parent, the Issuer and their respective Affiliates and
Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and

replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time
by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by giving notice to
the Trustee and the Issuer, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer and (2)
that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest in its capacity as Trustee that
is not eliminated, or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt,
then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not
less than six months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a
successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance

of appointment by the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss,

liability, taxes and expenses Incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part,
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

All notices to Holders will be validly given if emailed to them at their respective email

addresses in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. In addition, if and for
so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to the extent that the
rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any notices with respect
to the Notes. For so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders will


-----

be delivered to Euroclear and Clearstream, delivery of which shall be deemed to satisfy the
requirements of this paragraph, for further transmission to the holders of Book-Entry Interests.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if

published more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made;
_provided that, if notices are emailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later_
of such publication and the day after being so emailed. Any notice or communication emailed to a
Holder shall be emailed to such Person’s email addresses in the register of the Holders and shall
be sufficiently given to such Holder if so emailed within the time prescribed. Failure to email,
cause to be delivered or otherwise transmit a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in
it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is
emailed or delivered in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee
receives it.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, or premium, if

any, on the Notes or any Note Guarantee will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date
for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the
Notes will be prescribed three years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity**

The currency in which any series of Notes hereunder is issued (the “Relevant Currency”)

is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors
under or in connection with such series of Notes and the relevant Guarantees, as the case may be,
including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than the Relevant
Currency, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any
jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any
Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a
Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the
extent of the Relevant Currency amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount
so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is
not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do
so).

If that Relevant Currency amount is less than the Relevant Currency amount expressed to

be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any series of Notes, the Issuer and the Guarantors will
indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event,
the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint and several
basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity
provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder or the Trustee
to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information
used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate
and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantor’s other obligations, will give rise
to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any
Holder or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in


-----

full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in
respect of any sum due under any Note or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance

with any pound sterling-denominated restriction herein, the Sterling Equivalent amount for
purposes hereof that is denominated in a currency other than pound sterling shall be calculated
based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such non-pound sterling amount
is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since all the assets of the Issuer, TopCo and the Guarantors are held or located outside the

United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer, TopCo or any
Guarantor, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest,
Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the
Notes or the Guarantees, may not be collectable within the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the

Indenture and the Notes and the Note Guarantees, the Issuer, TopCo and each Guarantor will in
the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough
of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New York, United States.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes, including any Note Guarantees, and the rights and duties of

the parties thereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State
of New York.

**Certain Definitions**

Set forth below are certain defined terms which will be used in the Indenture. Reference is

made to the Indenture for a full disclosure of all defined terms to be used therein, as well as any
other capitalized terms used herein for which no definition is provided.

“Acquired Indebtedness” means Indebtedness (1) of a Person or any of its Subsidiaries

existing at the time such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, or (2) assumed in connection
with the acquisition of assets from such Person, in each case whether or not Incurred by such
Person in connection with such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary or such acquisition or (3)
of a Person at the time such Person merges with or into or consolidates or otherwise combines with
the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary. Acquired Indebtedness shall be deemed to have been
Incurred, with respect to sub-clause (1) of the preceding sentence, on the date such Person becomes
a Restricted Subsidiary and, with respect to sub-clause (2) of the preceding sentence, on the date
of consummation of such acquisition of assets and, with respect to sub-clause (3) of the preceding
sentence, on the date of the relevant merger, consolidation or other combination.

For the purposes of this definition, “control,” when used with respect to any Person, means the

through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; and the terms “controlling”
and “controlled” have meanings correlative to the foregoing.

Obligation applicable to such Indebtedness for a period equal to the remaining term of such
Indebtedness).

run rate cost savings effect (as calculated in good faith by a responsible financial or chief
accounting officer of the Parent) of any Group Initiatives that have been initiated, implemented or
are reasonably expected to occur within the next 24 months following the date of such calculation
by the Parent or its Restricted Subsidiaries during the relevant period or in connection with an
event specified in clauses (1), (2) or (3) above as though such Group Initiative had been fully
implemented on the first day of the relevant period); (ii) in determining the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding on any date of determination, pro forma effect shall be given to any Incurrence,
repayment, repurchase, defeasance or other acquisition, retirement or discharge of Indebtedness as
if such transaction had occurred on the first day of the relevant period, (iii) calculations shall also
give pro forma effect to any Specified Transaction that has occurred since the beginning of such
period but which has not yet been fully reflected in the relevant period (as determined and
calculated by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Parent), (iv) calculations shall
exclude any non-recurring costs and other expenses arising directly or indirectly as a consequence
of any Sale or Purchase or Specified Transaction and/or the implementation of any Group Initiative
and (v) “determined on a consolidated basis on the basis of IFRS,” “determined on the basis of

period for payment, if later the date 180 days after the expiry of that period), for the
avoidance of doubt excluding where the payment deferral results from the delayed
or non-satisfaction of contract terms by the supplier, from a dispute carried out in

and excluding earn-outs and other contingent consideration arrangements);

**Book-entry; delivery and form**

**General**

The Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S will initially be

represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached
(collectively, the “Regulation S Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes will be deposited,
on the Issue Date, with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the
common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

The Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule

144A will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (collectively, the “Rule 144A Global Notes” and, together with the Regulation S
Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The 144A Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue Date,
with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary
for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to

persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests
through such participants. Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be
effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and
their participants. The Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be issued only in
denominations of £100,000 or €100,000 and in integral multiples of or £1,000 or €1,000 in excess
thereof.

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear and/or

Clearstream, as applicable, will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer
systems the account of a participant with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The
laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain
purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. The foregoing
limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition,
while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not have the Notes
registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and
will not be considered the registered owners or “holders” of Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear and/or

Clearstream (or its nominee) will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all
purposes under the Indenture. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear
and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and the participants through which they own BookEntry Interests, in order to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders under the
Indenture.

None of the Initial Purchaser, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent

or the Registrar under the Indenture or any of their respective agents will have any responsibility
or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.


-----

**Issuance of definitive registered notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive

Notes in registered form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”) only if:

- Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as
depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days;

- Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an event of default under the Indenture; or

- the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, following an event of default under the Indenture.

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the

name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear
and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or the Issuer, as applicable (in accordance with their respective
customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the
beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the
restrictive legend referred to in “Transfer restrictions,” unless that legend is not required by the
Indenture or applicable law.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that any such

Definitive Registered Note has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if any such Definitive
Registered Note is mutilated and is surrendered to the Registrar, the Paying Agent, the Trustee or
the Issuer, the Issuer will issue and the Trustee will authenticate a replacement Definitive
Registered Note if the Trustee’s and the Issuer’s requirements are met. The Issuer, the Trustee, the
Registrar or the Paying Agent may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive
Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both to protect the
Issuer, the Trustee or the Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which
any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer may charge for any
expenses incurred by it in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become

or is about to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer
pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer, in its discretion, may, instead of issuing a
new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the
case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged only after the transferor

first delivers to the Trustee a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the
effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See
“Transfer restrictions.”

**Redemption of Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear and/or

Clearstream, as applicable, will distribute the same amount received by it in respect of the Global
Note so redeemed to the holders of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount


-----

received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in
connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received
by Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global
Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that under existing practices of Euroclear
and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and
Clearstream will credit its respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with
adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate;
_provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than £100,000 or €100,000 principal_
amount may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including

principal, premium, if any, interest, additional interest and additional amounts) to the Paying
Agent. The Paying Agent will, in turn, make such payments to the common depositary for
Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with
their respective procedures.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the registered holders

of the Global Notes (for example, Euroclear or Clearstream, or their respective nominees) as the
owners thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently,
none of the Issuer, the Trustee or any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility
or liability for:

    - any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect
participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, for any
such payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect
participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear,
Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on
account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

    - Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or

    - the records of the common depositary or the custodian.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are

the responsibility of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of
customers registered in “street name.”

**Currency and payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect

of, the Global Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, in pound sterling or euro.

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including

any regulations of the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuer, the
Trustee, the Initial Purchaser or any of their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a


-----

Global Note or a Book-Entry Interest or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or
expenses in relation to or resulting from any currency conversion or rounding effected in
connection with any such payment. Holders may be subject to foreign exchange risks that may
have economic and tax consequences to them.

**Action by owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted

to be taken by a holder of Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account
the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of
the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have
given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of
consents or waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. Nevertheless,
if there is an event of default under the Indenture, each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the
right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes in certificated form and to
distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their respective participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be done in accordance

with their respective rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder requires
physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell the Notes to
persons in states that require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such
holder must transfer its interest in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and in accordance with the provisions of the
Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Transfer restrictions.” Book
Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in
“Transfer restrictions.”

Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of the offering of

the Notes and the closing of the offering (the “40-day Period”), beneficial interests in a Regulation
S Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the
Rule 144A Global Note denominated in the same currency only if such transfer is made pursuant
to Rule 144A and the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a certificate (in the form provided in
the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor
reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a
transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer
restrictions described under “Transfer restrictions” and in accordance with all applicable securities
laws of the states of the United States and other jurisdictions.

After the expiration of the 40-day Period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note

may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest in the Rule
144A Global Note denominated in the same currency without compliance with these certification
requirements.


-----

Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes

delivery in the form of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note denominated in the
same currency only upon receipt by the Trustee of a written certification (in the form provided in
the Indenture) from the transferor to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with
Regulation S or Rule 144A or any other exemption (if available under the Securities Act).

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Transfer restrictions,” Book-Entry Interests

may be transferred and exchanged as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and
_Exchange.” Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who_
takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note of the same
denomination will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first-mentioned Global
Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will thereafter
be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry
Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it retains such a Book-Entry Interest. In the event
Additional Notes are issued pursuant to Regulation S that bear the same ISIN, Common Code,
CUSIP or other securities identification number as Notes belonging to the same series previously
issued, without being fungible with such series of initial Notes for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes that form part of that series,
including in respect of investors that hold Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes
on or prior to the date of issuance of such Additional Notes, will not be eligible for transfer to
Book-Entry Interests in a Rule 144A Global Note (if any) representing Notes of that same series.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in

a Global Note only as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and,
if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer
restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer restrictions.”

**Information concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and

Clearstream, as applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and
procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each
settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. None
of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Initial Purchaser or any of their respective agents are responsible for
those operations or procedures.

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also

facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective
participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear
and Clearstream provide to their participants, among other things, services for safekeeping,
administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities.
Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream
participants are financial institutions, such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks,
trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and/or Clearstream is
also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or


-----

maintain a custodian relationship with a Euroclear and/or Clearstream participant, either directly
or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act

on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest
to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream
systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a
definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take
physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial
interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the
Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes
only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global clearance and settlement under the book-entry system**

Application will be made for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the

Official List of the Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in
Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective
system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to

facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear and
Clearstream, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and
such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Guarantors,
the Trustee or their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by
Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations
under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Euro Notes will be made in euro. Initial settlement for the Sterling

Notes will be made in pound sterling. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in
registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against
payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and

will settle in same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important
to establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the
seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.


-----

**Certain tax considerations**

**Certain U.K. tax considerations**

The following is a general description of certain U.K. tax consequences relating to the

Notes and is based on current U.K. tax law as applied in England and Wales and HM Revenue &
Customs (“HMRC”) published practice (which may not be binding on HMRC), both of which may
be subject to change, possibly with retrospective effect. The comments below do not purport to be
a complete analysis of all U.K. tax considerations relating to the Notes, and in particular do not
address the U.K. tax consequences of disposing of the Notes. The comments below relate only to
persons who are the absolute beneficial owners of their Notes and who hold their Notes as a capital
investment, and do not deal with certain classes of persons (such as brokers or dealers in securities
and persons connected with the Issuer) to whom special rules may apply. The comments below do
not address the consequences of any further issues of securities that will form a single series with
the Notes (including the issuance of any Additional Notes).

The comments below do not purport to constitute legal or tax advice. If you are subject to

tax in any jurisdiction other than the U.K. or if you are in any doubt as to your tax position, you
should consult an appropriate professional adviser.

**_Interest on the Notes_**

_Payment of interest on the Notes_

Interest on the Notes may be payable by the Issuer without withholding or deduction for or

on account of U.K. income tax, provided the Notes are and remain listed on a “recognised stock
exchange” within the meaning of section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (“ITA”). The Exchange
is a recognised stock exchange for these purposes. The Notes will be treated as listed on the
Exchange if they are included in the Official List of the Exchange and are admitted to trading on
the Exchange.

If the Notes are not or cease to be listed on a “recognised stock exchange,” interest may be

payable by the Issuer without withholding or deduction for or on account of U.K. income tax where
the Issuer (and any person by or through whom interest on the Notes is paid) reasonably believes
at the time the payment is made that (a) the person beneficially entitled to the interest is a U.K.
resident company or a non-U.K. resident company that carries on a trade in the U.K. through a
permanent establishment and the payment is one that the non-U.K. resident company is required
to bring into account when calculating its profits subject to U.K. corporation tax or (b) the person
to whom the payment is made is one of the further classes of bodies or persons, and meets any
relevant conditions, set out in sections 935-937 of the ITA, provided that in either case HMRC has
not given a direction, the effect of which is that the payment of interest may not be made without
that withholding or deduction.

In all other cases, interest will be paid by the Issuer under deduction of U.K. income tax at

the basic rate (currently 20%) unless either the Issuer has received a direction to the contrary from
HMRC in respect of such relief as may be available pursuant to the provisions of any applicable
double taxation treaty or certain other limited exceptions apply.


-----

If interest were paid under deduction of U.K. income tax (e.g., if the Notes are not or cease

to be listed on the Exchange), holders of the Notes who are not resident in the U.K. may be able
to recover all or part of the tax deducted if there is an appropriate provision in an applicable double
taxation treaty.

Any premium payable on redemption of the Notes may be treated as a payment of interest

for U.K. tax purposes and, accordingly, may be subject to the U.K. withholding tax treatment
described above.

_Provision of information_

HMRC has powers to obtain information and documents relating to the Notes, including

in relation to issues of and other transactions in the Notes, interest, payments treated as interest
and other payments derived from the Notes. This may include the value of the Notes, details of the
beneficial owners of the Notes, of the person for whom the Notes are held and of the persons to
whom payments derived from the Notes are or may be paid. Information may be obtained from a
range of persons including persons who effect or are a party to such transactions on behalf of
others, registrars and administrators of such transactions, the registered holders of the Notes,
persons who make, receive or are entitled to receive payments derived from the Notes and persons
by or through whom interest and payments treated as interest are paid or credited.

Information obtained by HMRC may, in certain circumstances, be exchanged by HMRC

with the tax authorities of other jurisdictions.

**_Additional U.K. Tax Considerations_**

Interest and premium (if any) on the Notes may be subject to U.K. tax by way of direct

assessment (including self-assessment) even where paid without withholding or deduction for or
on account of U.K. income tax.

However, interest and premium (if any) received without withholding or deduction for or

on account of U.K. income tax will not be chargeable to U.K. tax in the hands of a holder of Notes
(other than certain trustees) who is not resident for tax purposes in the U.K. unless (a) that holder
of Notes is a company which carries on a trade in the U.K. through a permanent establishment in
the U.K. or, if not a company, carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the U.K. through a
branch or agency, and (b) the interest and premium (if any) is received in connection with, or the
Notes are attributable to, that permanent establishment, branch or agency. There are exemptions
for interest received by certain categories of agent (such as some brokers and investment
managers). The provisions of an applicable double taxation treaty may also be relevant for such
holders of Notes.

**_Payments by a Guarantor_**

If payments by a Guarantor under the Guarantees are not treated as having a U.K. source,

they should not be payable under deduction of U.K. income tax. If such payments are treated as
having a U.K. source then such payments by a Guarantor (other than the repayment of amounts
subscribed for the relevant Notes) may be subject to U.K. withholding tax at the basic rate
(currently 20%) subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions of any applicable


-----

double taxation treaty or any other relief or exemption which may apply (some of which are
described above).

**_Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (“SDRT”)_**

No U.K. stamp duty or SDRT is payable on the issue of the Notes, or on a transfer of the

Notes, provided that (i) the interest payable on the Notes does not exceed a reasonable commercial
return on the nominal amount of the Notes and (ii) the Notes do not carry a right on repayment to
an amount which exceeds the nominal amount of the Notes and which is not reasonably
comparable with what is generally repayable (in respect of a similar nominal amount of capital)
under the terms of issue of loan capital listed in the Official List of the London Stock Exchange.

**Certain United States federal income tax considerations**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the

purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes. This summary deals only with Notes held as
capital assets (within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”)) by U.S. holders (as defined below) who purchase the Notes for cash
pursuant to this offering at their “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of the
Notes is sold for money to investors, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or
organizations acting in the capacity of underwriter, placement agent or wholesaler).

As used herein, a “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of the Notes that is, for U.S.

federal income tax purposes, any of the following:

  - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

  - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) that is created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state
thereof or the District of Columbia;

  - an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its
source; or

  - a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and
one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust
or (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated
as a U.S. person.

If any entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes

holds Notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and
the activities of the partnership. If you are a partnership or a partner in a partnership considering
an investment in the Notes, you should consult your own tax advisors.

This summary does not represent a detailed description of the U.S. federal income tax

consequences applicable to you if you are a person subject to special tax treatment under the U.S.
federal income tax laws, including, without limitation:


-----

  - a broker or dealer in securities or currencies;

  - a financial institution;

  - a regulated investment company;

  - a real estate investment trust;

  - a tax-exempt organization;

  - an insurance company;

  - a person holding the Notes as part of a hedging, integrated, conversion or constructive sale
transaction or a straddle;

  - a trader in securities that has elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for his
securities;

  - a partnership or other pass-through entity or arrangement (or an investor in such an entity
or arrangement);

  - a U.S. holder whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar; or

  - a U.S. expatriate.

This summary is based on the Code, U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and

judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, possibly on a retroactive
basis, so as to result in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those summarized
below. We have not and will not seek any rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”)
regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take
positions concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes
that are different from those discussed below.

This summary does not represent a detailed description of the U.S. federal income tax

consequences to you in light of your particular circumstances and does not address the Medicare
contribution tax on net investment income, the alternative minimum tax or the effects of any U.S.
state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. It is not intended to be, and should not be construed to be, legal
or tax advice to any particular purchaser of Notes.

**If you are considering the purchase of Notes, you should consult your tax advisors concerning**
**the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and**
**disposition of the Notes, as well as the consequences to you arising under other U.S. federal**
**tax laws and the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.**

**_IPO Pushdown_**

An IPO Pushdown (as defined in “Description of the Notes”) could result in a taxable

exchange of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in which case you may recognize gain
or loss on the Notes (although any such loss may be disallowed) at such time equal to the
difference, if any, between the issue price of the deemed newly issued Notes (as determined for
U.S. federal income tax purposes) and your adjusted tax basis in the Notes, and have a new holding


-----

period and tax basis in the Notes. Any such gain or loss will be taxed under the rules described
below under “—Sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of Notes.” If
the fair market value of the Notes at the time of such taxable exchange were lower than the stated
redemption price by more than a de minimis amount, you may be required to include the difference
as ordinary income as it accrues (on a constant yield to maturity basis) in advance of the receipt of
cash. You should consult your tax advisors regarding the potential U.S. federal income tax
consequences to you in the event of an IPO Pushdown.

**_Payments of interest_**

It is expected, and the remainder of this discussion assumes, that the Notes will not be

issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, interest on a Note (including any

foreign tax withheld and additional amounts paid in respect thereof) will generally be taxable to
you as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued in accordance with your method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. You may be entitled to deduct or credit any
foreign tax withheld, subject to certain limitations (including that the election to deduct or credit
foreign taxes applies to all of your applicable foreign taxes for a particular tax year). Interest
income (including any additional amounts) on a Note will generally be considered foreign source
income and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, will generally be considered passive
category income. You will generally be denied a foreign tax credit for foreign taxes imposed with
respect to the Notes where you do not meet a minimum holding period requirement during which
you are not protected from risk of loss. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex.
You are urged to consult your own tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit
under your particular circumstances.

Interest on the Euro Notes will be payable in euro and interest on the Sterling Notes will

be payable in pound sterling (each, a “Foreign Currency”). If you use the cash basis method of
accounting, you will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value
of the amount of interest received on the Notes, determined by translating the Foreign Currency
received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received, regardless of whether the payment
is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. You will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to
the receipt of such payment (other than exchange gain or loss realized on the disposition of the
Foreign Currency so received).

If you use the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you may

determine the amount of income recognized with respect to such interest in accordance with either
of two methods. Under the first method you will be required to include in income (as ordinary
income) for each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the interest that has accrued on the Notes
held during such year, determined by translating such interest at the average rate of exchange for
the period or periods (or portions thereof) during which such interest accrued. Under the second
method, you may elect to translate interest income at the spot rate on:

  - the last day of the accrual period;

  - the last day of the taxable year if the accrual period straddles your taxable year; or


-----

  - the date the interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the end
of the accrual period.

If you elect to use the second method, the election must be consistently applied by you to

all debt instruments from year to year and can be changed only with the consent of the IRS. In
addition, if you use the accrual method of accounting, upon receipt of an interest payment on a
Note (including, upon the sale of a Note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts
attributable to accrued but unpaid interest previously included in income), you will recognize U.S.
source ordinary income or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar
value of such payment (determined by translating the Foreign Currency received at the spot rate
on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income you
previously included in income with respect to such payment (as determined above).

**_Sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, you

generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the
sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition (less any amount attributable
to accrued but unpaid interest, which will be taxable as interest income as discussed above in “—
_Payments of interest”) and the adjusted tax basis in the Note. Your adjusted tax basis in a Note_
will generally be your U.S. dollar cost for that Note. If you purchased your Note with Foreign
Currency, your cost generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the Foreign Currency paid for such
Note determined at the spot rate on the date of such purchase. If your Note is sold, exchanged,
retired, redeemed or otherwise disposed of in a taxable disposition for Foreign Currency, then your
amount realized generally will be based on the spot rate in effect on the date of such sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition. If you are a cash method taxpayer and the
Notes are traded on an established securities market for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Foreign
Currency paid or received will be translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the settlement date
of the purchase or sale. If you use the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, you may elect the settlement date treatment with respect to the purchase and sale of
Notes traded on an established securities market for U.S. federal income tax purposes, provided
that such election is applied consistently to all debt instruments held by you from year to year.
Such election cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS.

Except with respect to Foreign Currency gain or loss attributable to changes in exchange

rates as discussed below, any gain or loss you recognize will generally be capital gain or loss and
will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if you have held the Note for more than one year.
Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) are eligible for
reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Any gain or
loss you recognize will generally be treated as U.S. source gain or loss.

A portion of your gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of a Note may be treated

as exchange gain or loss. Exchange gain or loss will generally be treated as U.S. source ordinary
income or loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the Note is your purchase price for the
Note calculated in the Foreign Currency on the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain
or loss recognized is equal to the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal


-----

amount determined at the spot rate on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or
other taxable disposition of the Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount
determined at the spot rate on the date you purchased the Note (or, possibly, in the case of cash
basis or electing accrual basis taxpayers, the settlement dates of such purchase and taxable
disposition, if the Note is treated as traded on an established securities market for U.S. federal
income tax purposes). The amount of exchange gain or loss realized on the disposition of the Note
(with respect to both principal and accrued interest) will be limited to the amount of overall gain
or loss realized on the disposition of the Note.

**_Disposition of Foreign Currency_**

Your tax basis in any Foreign Currency received as interest on a Note or on the sale,

exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Note will be the U.S. dollar value thereof
at the spot rate in effect on the date the Foreign Currency is received. Any gain or loss recognized
by you on a sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of the Foreign Currency will generally be
treated as U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

**_Additional Notes_**

The Issuer may issue Additional Notes (as defined in “Description of the Notes”) under the

Indenture. Even if these Additional Notes are treated as part of the same series as the Notes for
non-tax purposes, in some cases they may be treated as a separate series for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. For instance, Additional Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S from time to time may
be issued with the same ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as
the applicable series of Notes previously issued under the Indenture without being fungible with
such series of Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If you are a U.S. holder considering the
purchase of Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S as part of this offering of Notes or in the secondary
market, you should consult your tax advisors concerning the particular U.S. federal income tax
consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and disposition of such Notes, including with
respect to the potential issuance of Additional Notes that are not fungible with the applicable series
of initial Notes issued under the Indenture for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but which
nevertheless are not capable of being separately identified.

**_Reportable transactions_**

U.S. Treasury regulations issued under the Code meant to require the reporting of certain

tax shelter transactions could be interpreted to cover transactions generally not regarded as tax
shelters, including certain foreign currency transactions. Under the U.S. Treasury regulations,
certain transactions are required to be reported to the IRS, including, in certain circumstances, a
sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note or
foreign currency received in respect of a foreign currency note to the extent that such sale,
exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition results in a tax loss in excess of a
threshold amount. If you are considering the purchase of a Note, you should consult with your tax
advisors to determine the tax return obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes,
including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).


-----

**_Backup withholding and information reporting_**

Generally, information reporting requirements will apply to all payments of interest and

principal on a Note or the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of a Note paid to you, unless
you are an exempt recipient. Additionally, if you fail to provide your taxpayer identification
number, or in the case of interest payments, fail either to report in full dividend and interest income
or to make certain certifications, you may be subject to backup withholding on any such payments
or proceeds.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup

withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against your U.S. federal income tax
liability provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Foreign Financial Asset Reporting_**

Certain U.S. holders are required to report information relating to an interest in the Notes,

subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for the Notes held in accounts maintained by
certain financial institutions), by attaching a complete IRS Form 8938, Statement of Specified
Financial Assets, with their tax return for each year in which they hold an interest in the Notes.
You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the application of these rules to your
ownership of the Notes and potential penalties for failure to comply.

**Certain insolvency and local law limitations**

_Set out below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the Guarantees_

_and the security interests relating to the Notes, and of certain insolvency law considerations in_
_England and Wales, where each of the Issuer, the Guarantors and the providers of security (as at_
_the date hereof) are organized or incorporated. It is a summary only. Bankruptcy or insolvency_
_proceedings or a similar event could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions and/or in the_
_jurisdiction of organization or incorporation of a future guarantor under the Notes. The_
_application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which_
_jurisdictions’ law should apply and could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and_
_to collect payment in full under the Notes, the Guarantees and any security securing the Notes._

_Also set out below is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency laws in England_

_and Wales. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer or the Guarantors or providers of_
_Collateral experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which_
_jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the_
_outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the_
_obligations and the security granted by any of the Issuer and the Guarantors._

**England and Wales**

**_United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union_**

Following a national referendum in June 2016, the U.K. exercised its right pursuant to

Article 50 of the Treaty on the EU to initiate a process to withdraw from the EU and ceased to be
a member of the EU on January 31, 2020 at 11:00 p.m. (London time) (“Exit Day”). As a result, a
reference in this Offering Memorandum to the Recast Insolvency Regulation as it applies to the
U.K. is to be read, on or after Exit Day, as a reference to such EU regulation as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act (as amended) (the
“EUWA”) and, as it may have been, or may from time to time be, amended, modified or re-enacted
by domestic law and shall include any subordinate legislation made from time to time under that
EU regulation, as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of section 3 of the EUWA.

On Exit Day, the U.K. entered into a transition period which ended on December 31, 2020

at 11:00 p.m. (London time) (“IP Day”). During this transition period, the U.K. continued to be
treated as a member state of the EEA, including for the purpose of the Recast Insolvency
Regulation. Following the transition period, the U.K. ceased to be treated as a member state of
EEA.

The Recast Insolvency Regulation was amended with effect from IP Day pursuant to the

Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (as amended by the Insolvency
(Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 and the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) (No. 2)
Regulations 2019) (the “Insolvency Amendment Regulations”) such that the provisions regarding
mutual recognition of insolvency proceedings under the Recast Insolvency Regulation, providing
for the automatic recognition of insolvency proceedings commenced in other Member States no
longer apply. However, the EUWA provided for the Recast Insolvency Regulation to continue to
apply, as it did pre-IP Day, to insolvency proceedings provided the main proceedings were opened


-----

before December 31, 2020. It did not, however, specify whether the Recast Insolvency Regulation
will continue to apply where only secondary proceedings have been opened. Therefore, and
_provided that the main proceedings were started before January 1, 2021, the U.K. will continue to_
recognize insolvency proceedings commenced in other Member States, and will receive reciprocal
recognition of U.K. insolvency proceedings unless the court considers (i) the interests of a creditor,
the debtor, or shareholders of a corporate debtor, would be materially prejudiced; or (ii) it would
be manifestly contrary to U.K. public policy. The U.K. courts could also seek to apply relevant
U.K. law.

The Insolvency Amendment Regulations, which (with the exception of the Insolvency

(Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 which came into effect immediately prior to IP Day)
came into effect on Exit Day, amend EU insolvency legislation which had direct effect in the U.K.
In addition to the pre-existing English law grounds to establish jurisdiction (see “—Insolvency”),
the post-IP Day Recast Insolvency Regulation (as amended by the Insolvency Amendment
Regulations) provides that jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings in the U.K. courts in
respect of a debtor can be established where such proceedings are opened for the purposes of
rescue, adjustment of debt, reorganization or liquidation and:

  - the center of the debtor’s main interests is in the U.K.; or

  - the center of the debtor’s main interests is in a Member State and there is an establishment
in the U.K.

These tests are consistent with the Recast Insolvency Regulation for determining the proper

jurisdiction for a debtor’s insolvency proceedings and the applicable law to be used in those
proceedings. However, the Insolvency Amendment Regulations extend the U.K. court’s
jurisdiction (i) _provided the court considers there to be sufficient connection, to wind up any_
foreign company which might be wound up as an unregistered company under U.K. insolvency
laws irrespective of whether the center of main interests is in a Member State; and (ii) to place a
company incorporated or having its center of main interests in an EEA state, into administration
in the U.K.

**_Insolvency_**

Certain of the Guarantors and certain of the providers of Collateral are companies

incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (an “English company”). Any insolvency
proceedings with respect to an English company would (subject to the location of the relevant
company’s COMI at the time of any filing) be based on English insolvency laws.

In addition, the U.K. Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006, which implement the

UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross Border Insolvency in Great Britain and which apply to foreign
insolvency proceedings (subject to certain exceptions) anywhere in the world without any
condition of reciprocity, provide that certain collective foreign (i.e., non-English) proceedings may
be recognized by the English courts as foreign main proceedings where any English company has
its COMI in that foreign jurisdiction, or as foreign non main proceedings where it has an
“establishment” in such foreign jurisdiction (being a place of operations where it carries out a nontransitory economic activity with human means and assets or services). As such, should any


-----

English company have its COMI in a jurisdiction that is not within the U.K., and insolvency
proceedings are opened in that jurisdiction and afforded recognition by the English courts, any
proceedings opened in England and Wales would be foreign non main proceedings and would be
limited to the assets that the relevant company has in the U.K. Upon recognition of foreign main
proceedings, an automatic stay, equivalent to the stay in an English compulsory liquidation (see
below), will apply to prevent certain types of creditor action in the U.K., including commencement
of proceedings concerning the debtor’s assets, rights, obligations or liabilities (but the automatic
stay will not affect a creditor’s rights to enforce security over the debtor’s property (albeit such a
stay may be requested from the English court)). No automatic stay applies in relation to foreign
non main proceedings (albeit such a stay may be requested from the English court).

Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a

number of ways, including by the company or a creditor making an application for administration
in court, the company or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (discussed below) making an
application for administration out of court, or by a creditor filing a petition to wind up the company
or the company resolving to do so (in the case of a liquidation). A company with its COMI in
England and Wales may be wound up if it is unable to pay its debts, and may be placed into
administration if it is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts, and the administration is
reasonably likely to achieve one of three statutory purposes (as described below).

English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions

with which investors may be familiar. In the event that an English obligor experiences financial
difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar
proceedings. On the Issue Date, the obligations under the Notes will be guaranteed by the
Guarantees and the Notes and the Guarantees will be secured by security interests over the
Collateral. English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a
Guarantee against an English obligor and the enforceability of security interests over the
Collateral.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to

certain limitations on the Guarantees and the security interests over the Collateral. The application
of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the
Guarantees and/or the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees and therefore may limit
the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of a Guarantor.

**_Administration_**

The Insolvency Act 1986 (as amended, the “Insolvency Act”) and the onshored version of

the Recast Insolvency Regulation (which pursuant to the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit)
Regulations 2019 has been substantially amended) empower English courts to make an
administration order in respect of an English company, a company incorporated in another EEA
state, a company not incorporated in an EEA state with its COMI in a member state of the EU
(other than Denmark), a company (wherever incorporated) having its COMI in England or a
company (wherever incorporated) with its COMI in a member state of the EU (other than
Denmark) and an “establishment” in England. Without limitation and subject to specific
conditions, an administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that (a) the relevant


-----

company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and (b) the administration order is
reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration.

A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay

its debts as they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s
assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective
liabilities). Such insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy
a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 (for a period of 3 weeks) or to satisfy in
full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order). The purpose of an administration is
comprised of three parts that must be looked at successively: rescuing the company as a going
concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s
creditors as a whole than would be likely upon immediate liquidation or, if neither of those
objectives is reasonably practicable and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not
unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or
preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out
below (see “—Priority on insolvency”).

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, an English company, the directors of

such company or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (as defined below) where the floating
charge has become enforceable may also appoint an administrator out of court, and different
procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer.

An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain

requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration
(including property subject to a floating charge).

In addition, certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an

administration. Upon the appointment of an administrator, a statutory moratorium is imposed and
no step may be taken to enforce security over the company’s property except with the consent of
the administrator or permission of the court. The same requirements for consent or permission
apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution,
distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will
consider discretionary factors in determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of
statutory objectives of administration described above.

However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined

circumstances, be able to realize their security over certain of that company’s property
notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium
in relation to a “security financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or
financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit
claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (see
further below). If an English company were to enter administration, it is possible that, to the extent
such security is not a financial collateral arrangement, the security or guarantee granted by it would
not be able to be enforced while the company is in administration without leave of the court or
consent of the administrators (although a demand for payment could be made under a guarantee
granted by it).


-----

Accordingly, if any of the Issuer, or the Guarantors or the providers of Collateral were to

enter into administration, the Notes and the Guarantees and the Collateral, as applicable, could not
be enforced while the relevant company was in administration without the permission of the court
or consent of the administrator.

**_Administration and floating charges_**

As set out above, the Insolvency Act empowers the English courts to make an

administration order in respect of an English company in certain circumstances. An administrator
can also be appointed out of court by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying
floating charge and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer.

In order to empower the security agent to appoint an administrative receiver or an

administrator to the company, the floating charge granted by the relevant English obligor must
constitute a “qualifying floating charge” for the purposes of English insolvency law and, in the
case of the ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless
the security document pre-dates September 15, 2003, fall within one of the exceptions in the
Insolvency Act to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. The most
relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the
exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act, which will
apply if an English obligor creates a debt of at least £50,000,000 for the relevant company during
the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets
investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act, but is generally a rated, listed or traded debt
instrument)). If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be
appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating
charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the
administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the
administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a
preference or an invalid floating charge. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative
receiver will vacate office, and any receiver of any part of the company’s property must resign if
required to do so by the administrator.

In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by

an instrument which (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it, (b) purports to
empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company or (c) purports to empower the
holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the
Insolvency Act. The security agent will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating
charge security, together (if necessary) with the fixed charge security interests, relate to the whole
or substantially the whole of the relevant English obligor’s property and at least one such security
interest is a qualifying floating charge. Please note that carve-outs in the security document which
apply to the floating charge may, on their own, or cumulatively with other carve-outs, impact the
analysis of whether the ‘whole or substantially the whole of the property’ is covered by the charge
and therefore whether the charge is a “qualifying floating charge.”

An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of the company

will be required to ring fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge
security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (the “Prescribed Part”). This applies to 50% of the


-----

first £10,000 of floating charge realizations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, and the
Prescribed Part is subject to a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (such cap being effected by
the Insolvency Act 1986 (Prescribed Part) (Amendment) Order 2020) (except where the
company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge
created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part
must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be
disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors. The Prescribed Part will not be available for
any shortfall claims of secured creditors.

The requirement for an administrator, liquidator or receiver (including administrative

receiver) to set aside a prescribed part of the company’s property which is subject to a floating
charge, and make it available for unsecured creditors, will not apply to any charge created or
otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement (as described in the Financial Collateral
Arrangements (No 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226)), as set out below.

**_Fixed and floating charges_**

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating

charge security: (a) an administrator appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge
assets to cash and, where the floating charge is not a security financial collateral arrangement, use
such cash, or use cash subject to a floating charge, to meet administration expenses (which can
include the costs of continuing to operate the charging company’s business while in
administration) in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder; (b) a fixed charge, even if
created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against the floating charge over the
charged assets (provided the fixed charge holder has no notice of any restrictions); (c) provided
that the floating charge is not a security financial collateral arrangement, general costs and
expenses (including the liquidator’s remuneration) properly incurred in a winding-up are payable
out of the company’s assets (including the assets that are the subject of the floating charge) in
priority to floating charge claims; (d) until the floating charge security crystallizes, a company is
entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of
business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as
to give a third-party good title to the assets free of the floating charge; (e) floating charge security
is subject to certain challenges under English insolvency law (see “—Administration and floating
_charges—Grant of floating charge”); and (f) where the floating charge is not a security financial_
collateral arrangement, floating charge security is (i) subject to the claims of certain preferential
creditors (such as employee, salary claims (up to a cap per employee), employee holiday claims
and certain unpaid pension contributions) and (ii) subject to the ring fencing of the Prescribed Part
(as defined below) for unsecured creditors; and (g) an administrator may dispose of or take action
relating to property subject to a floating charge without the prior consent of the charge holder or
court but the floating charge holder retains the same priority in respect of the proceeds from the
disposal of the assets subject to the floating charge. With prior approval of the court, an
administrator may deal with property subject to a fixed charge, _provided that disposing of the_
property is likely to promote the administration’s purpose and that the administrator apply the net
proceeds from the disposal of the property in question towards discharging the obligations of the
company to the charge holder.


-----

Under English law there is a possibility that a court could re-characterize fixed security

interests purported to be created by an English law governed security document to properly take
effect as floating charges; as the description given to security interests by the parties is not
determinative. Whether security interests purported to be fixed security interests will be upheld as
fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend on, among other things,
whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal
in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the
chargee in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with that are the subject of a purported fixed
charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee prior to crystallization, the court is
likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding
that it may be described as a fixed charge in the security documents.

If any fixed security interests are re-characterized as floating security interests: (a) the

proceeds of those assets could be applied in meeting other liabilities of the company in priority to
the claims of the purported fixed charge holder in insolvency proceedings; and (b) it is possible
that any purported floating charge security may no longer relate to the whole or substantially the
whole of the property of the relevant company and therefore may not constitute a “qualifying
floating charge.”

**_Scheme of arrangement_**

Although not an insolvency proceeding, pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006

the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise
of a company’s liabilities between a company and its creditors (or any class of its creditors). An
English obligor may be able to pursue a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. In addition, a
foreign Obligor which (a) is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act and (b) has a
“sufficient connection” to England and Wales could also pursue a scheme. In practice, a foreign
company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to be
satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s COMI is in England, the company’s finance
documents are English law governed or the company’s finance documents have been amended in
accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will be
considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily
determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case.

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will

vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in
a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed
scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can
be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75% or more by
value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favor
of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance
documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected
creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted
against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing
where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The
court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional
upon modifications being made or reject the scheme. In certain circumstances, a scheme of


-----

arrangement can also result in the release of guarantees in order to ensure the effectiveness of the
compromise.

**_Company voluntary arrangement_**

Pursuant to Part I of the Insolvency Act, a company (by its directors or its administrator or

liquidator, as applicable) may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s
shareholders and creditors which entails a compromise, or other arrangement, between the
company and its creditors, typically a rescheduling or reducing of the company’s debts. Provided
that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of shareholders and creditors by way of a
decision procedure, it will bind all unsecured creditors who were entitled to vote on the proposal.
A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured creditor to enforce its
security, except with its consent.

In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved

by at least 75% (by value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and
no more than 50% (by value) of unconnected creditors may vote against it. Secured debt cannot
be voted in a company voluntary arrangement, however, a secured creditor may vote to the extent
that it is undersecured. A secured creditor who proves in the company voluntary arrangement for
the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given up its security.

**_Liquidation/winding-up_**

Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of a company are

realized and distributed by the liquidator to creditors and (if applicable) members in the statutory
order of priority prescribed by the Insolvency Act (see “—Priority on insolvency”). Once the
liquidator has completed this task, the company is dissolved and removed from the register of
companies. There are two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court;
and (b) members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by
resolution of the company’s members. The difference between the two latter proceedings is the
solvency of the company in question; in a members’ voluntary liquidation, the directors of the
company swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency over the following 12 months.
The primary ground for the compulsory winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to
pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). Note that while a creditors’
voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the
members, not the creditors, once in place the process is subject to some degree of control by the
creditors.

The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a

voluntary winding-up. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act any
disposition of the relevant company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up
is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any property or security
interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral
arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations (as defined herein). Subject to certain
exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to
have commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. Once a winding-up
order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No legal


-----

action may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court
although there is no freeze on the enforcement of security. As a result of certain temporary changes
introduced by the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020, the impact of Section 127 of
the Insolvency Act has been altered such that the relevant date for considering whether a
disposition of property is void is no longer the date on which the petition was presented, but
instead, the date on which the winding-up order was granted. Once the temporary changes cease
on June 30, 2021 (or such later date as may be imposed), the relevant date is expected to return to
the date the petition is presented.

In the context of a voluntary winding-up, however, there is no equivalent to the

retrospective effect of a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the
resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act.
There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up – it is for the liquidator, or
any creditor or contributory of the company, to apply for a stay. This is important because, if a
stay is not obtained, it means secured creditors, for example, can go ahead and enforce their
security.

A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company,

to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to
sell the company’s property and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge
antecedent transactions.

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous property,

which encapsulates any unprofitable contract and any other property of the company that cannot
be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act.
A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing
financial obligations on the company that may be detrimental to its creditors. However, this power
does not apply to a contract that has already been substantially performed, nor can it be used to
disturb accrued rights and liabilities. In addition, the power to disclaim onerous property does not
apply where the collateral provider or collateral taker under the arrangement is being wound up,
nor to any financial collateral arrangement.

**_Priority on insolvency_**

One of the primary functions of winding-up (and, where the company cannot be rescued

as a going concern, one of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realize
the assets of the company in question and distribute the proceeds from those assets to the
company’s creditors.

In accordance with the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules 2016, creditors are placed

into different classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property
applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part
(as defined below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims
of the creditors in a prior-ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed
otherwise, distributions are made on a _pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in_
proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class.


-----

Whereas the principle of pari passu distribution would dis-allow contractual setting-off

arrangements entered into after a company enters liquidation or an administrator issues notice of
his/her intention to make a distribution of assets to creditors, it does not prevent the effect of
mandatory insolvency set-off, which sees an account being taken of what is due from each party
to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and whereby only any net balance owed by the
company is provable in the administration or liquidation. This effectively affords the creditor with
a potential super priority status, in that its loss (i.e., the amount owed to the insolvent company, if
any) is automatically reduced.

The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

  - First ranking: holders of fixed charge security (but only to the extent the value of the
secured assets covers that indebtedness) and creditors with a proprietary interest in assets
in the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor with respect to
the assets in which they have a proprietary interest only;

  - Second ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out
the order of priority in which expenses are paid);

  - Third ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors.

Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent

company in relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and
salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a
maximum of £800 per person; (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been
terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency; and (d) bank
and building deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation
Scheme (the “FSCS”) up to the statutory limit. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts
rank equally.

Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of the ordinary

preferential debts and include: (a) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the
FSCS to the extent that claims exceed the statutory limit; and (b) VAT and other certain tax debts
due to HMRC as set out in section 386 and paragraph 15D of Schedule 6 of the Insolvency Act..
As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally;

  - Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their
security. This would include any security interest that was stated to be a fixed charge in the
document that created it but which, on proper interpretation by the court, was rendered a
floating charge. However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating
charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set
aside for distribution to unsecured creditors;

  - Fifth ranking:

`o` firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and (to the extent of any unsecured
shortfall) secured creditors, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on


-----

those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings.
To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder
can only use realizations from unsecured assets as secured creditors are not entitled
to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient
to pay out all unsecured creditors;

`o` secondly, interest on the company’s unsubordinated debts (at the higher of the
applicable contractual rate and the rate determined in accordance with the
Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum)) in respect of any period after the
commencement of liquidation or after the commencement of an administration
which has been converted into a distributing administration. However, in the case
of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or the Guarantees, such interest
due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the
secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and

`o` thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the
categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all
categories above are fully repaid; and

  - Sixth ranking: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any
remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent
company.

Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the

terms of the subordination language in the relevant documentation.

An insolvency practitioner of the company (e.g., an administrator, administrative receiver

or liquidator) will generally be required to ring-fence the Prescribed Part (a certain percentage of
the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (after
making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses out of floating charge realizations)).
This ring-fence applies to (a) 50% of the first £10,000 of the company’s net property and (b) 20%
of the remainder of the company’s net property over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of
£800,000 (such cap being effected by the Insolvency Act 1986 (Prescribed Part) (Amendment)
Order 2020) (except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder
of a first-ranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum
aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured creditors
unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors.

**_Avoidance of transactions_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English

company of security and guarantees can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if the
company is placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period (as set out in more
detail below) of the granting of the guarantee or security. Therefore, if during the specified period
an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English company, he or she may challenge the
validity of the guarantee or security given by such company.


-----

The following potential grounds for challenge may apply under English law to guarantees

and security interests:

**_Transaction at an undervalue_**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company could

apply to the court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or grant
other relief) if such liquidator or administrator believes that the creation of such security interest
or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. There will only be a transaction at an
undervalue, if at the time of the transaction or as a consequence of the transaction, the English
company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act, as amended)
and if the English company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period
of two years from the date the English company grants the security interest or the guarantee.

A transaction might be a transaction at an undervalue if the company makes a gift to a

person, if the company receives no consideration or if the company receives consideration of
significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such
company. However, a court will not make an order if it is satisfied that the company entered into
the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it
did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it. If the court
determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such order
as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been in if the transaction had not been
entered into. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the
English company was insolvent unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (as
defined in the Insolvency Act), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the
connected person must demonstrate the solvency of the English company in such proceedings.

**_Preference_**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company could

apply to the court for an order to set aside, among others, the creation of a security interest or a
guarantee if such liquidator or administrator believes that the creation of such security interest or
such guarantee constituted a preference. There will only be a preference if, at the time the
transaction was entered into, the English company was unable to pay its debts (as defined in the
Insolvency Act) or the English company becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the
Insolvency Act) as a consequence of its entry into the transaction and if the English company
enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of six months (if the
beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the
beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the English company takes the decision to grant
the security interest or the guarantee.

A transaction may constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the

English company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better
position (in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor
or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. If the court
determines that the transaction constituted such a preference, the court may make such order as it
thinks fit for restoring the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been


-----

given, which could, in this case, include reducing payments under or setting aside the Notes and
the Guarantees. However, for the court to determine a preference, it must be shown that in deciding
to give the preference the English company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential
effect. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English
company was insolvent at the relevant time and that the company was influenced by a desire to
produce the preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person,
in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and that the company was influenced by a desire
to produce the preferential effect and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings
that there was no such influence.

**_Transaction defrauding creditors_**

Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an

undervalue and was made for the substantial purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person
who is making, or may make, a claim against a company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests
of a person in relation to the claim which that person is making or may make, the transaction may
be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. An application to the court for an
order to set aside the transaction may be made by an administrator, a liquidator and, subject to
certain conditions, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority and the United Kingdom
Pensions Regulator. In addition, any person who is, or who is capable of being, prejudiced by the
transaction may (with the leave of the court in the case of a company in administration or
liquidation) also bring an application to set aside such transaction. There is no time limit in the
English insolvency legislation within which the challenge must be made and the relevant company
does not need to be insolvent at the time of the transaction. If the court determines that the
transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit
to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and
to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court order may affect the
property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he or she is the person with
whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in
property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor company in good faith, for value
and without notice of the relevant circumstances and will not require a person who received a
benefit from the transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant
circumstances, to pay any sum unless such person was a party to the transaction.

**_Grant of floating charge_**

Under English insolvency law, if an English obligor is unable to pay its debts at the time

of (or as a result of) granting the floating charge, and the floating charge was granted within the
specified period referred to below, then such floating charge can be avoided except to the extent
of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction
of any debt of, the relevant English obligor at the same time as or after the creation of the floating
charge (plus certain interest).

The requirement for the English obligor to be insolvent at the time of (or as a result of)

granting the floating charge does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected
person. If the floating charge is granted to a connected person, and the floating charge was granted
within the specified period referred to below, then the floating charge is invalid except to the extent


-----

of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction
of any debt of, the relevant English obligor at the same time as or after the creation of the floating
charge (plus certain interest), whether the relevant English obligor is solvent or insolvent at the
time of grant.

The granting of the floating charge can be challenged only if the relevant English obligor

enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of one year (if the beneficiary
is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the
relevant English obligor grants the floating charge. However, if the floating charge qualifies as a
“security financial collateral agreement” under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2)
Regulations 2003 (as amended), the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described
in this paragraph.

**_Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003_**

The Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (the

“Financial Collateral Regulations”), apply in respect of certain security interests granted over,
and certain title transfer arrangements in, “financial collateral” (together, “financial collateral
_arrangements”). Financial collateral is defined in the Financial Collateral Regulations as cash,_
financial instruments or credit claims. The definition of “financial instruments” includes shares in
companies and debt instruments such as bonds and claims under loans made by credit institutions.
The original primary purpose of the Financial Collateral Regulations was to implement Directive
2002/47/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 6, 2002 on financial collateral
arrangements (OJ 2002 L168/43) in the U.K. The purpose of that directive was to simplify the
process of taking financial collateral across the EU by introducing a minimum uniform legal
framework.

If an arrangement qualifies as a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial

Collateral Regulations certain modifications or exclusions to English insolvency law apply which
remove restrictions on enforcing security, disapply provisions relating to the order of payment of
creditors and prohibit avoidance by the insolvency office holder of the financial collateral
arrangement in certain situations. For example, security interests to which the Financial Collateral
Regulations apply are not required to be registered as a registrable charge at Companies House,
and are not subject to the statutory moratorium on enforcement of security that would otherwise
apply when a company enters into administration proceedings and furthermore, the Financial
Collateral Regulations enable the creditor holding the security interest to appropriate (i.e., to
become the absolute legal owner of) the financial collateral to which the security interests applies
without the need for a court order _provided the security interests have become enforceable in_
accordance with their terms and provided the creditor has been granted the power to appropriate
in the relevant contract.

**_Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020_**

On June 26, 2020, the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (the “Act”) enacted

fundamental reforms to the U.K.’s existing insolvency and companies legislation. Some of these
measures had been proposed in August 2018 but were fast-tracked through the U.K. legislative
process in response to COVID-19. The measures include (but are not limited to) the following:


-----

_(a)_ _Moratorium_

The Act introduced a new standalone moratorium to enable the company to seek rescue

options and reach an agreement with its creditors to facilitate a restructuring.

Subject to certain exclusions and meeting requisite conditions, any company that is liable

to be wound up under the Insolvency Act is eligible for a moratorium. Ineligible companies include
certain financial services companies (including insurance and securitization companies as well as
parties to capital market arrangements). Directors of any eligible company may commence a
moratorium by filing the requisite papers at court. From October 1, 2021 (which may be extended
by the U.K. government), directors must apply to court to commence a moratorium for any
company that has entered into a moratorium, administration or company voluntary arrangement in
the preceding twelve months, whereupon the court will consider whether a moratorium will result
in a better outcome for creditors as a whole than winding up without one.

Both in- and out-of-court processes involve a statement from the directors of the company

that, in their view, the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts. Furthermore, a
monitor, who is an insolvency practitioner appointed to oversee the moratorium, must separately
confirm (among other things) that the moratorium would likely result in the rescue of the company
as a going concern. This is an ongoing requirement in order for a moratorium to continue; indeed,
a monitor must terminate the moratorium if, at any time, it becomes apparent that the company is
unlikely to be rescued as a going concern and/or meet its financial obligations.

A company subject to a moratorium has the benefit of a payment holiday in relation to

certain debts incurred prior to the commencement of the moratorium. However, certain other debts,
including those which arise under a contract or other instrument involving financial services
(which would include capital market arrangements) entered into or incurred prior to the
moratorium, are exempted from payment holidays and such liabilities are therefore required to be
met as and when they fall due. Failure to pay such liabilities, plus any debt incurred during the
moratorium, which arise or become payable during the moratorium will compel the monitor to end
the moratorium.

During a moratorium, creditors are restricted from taking enforcement measures against

the company, including commencing insolvency and other legal proceedings and enforcing
security without the leave of the monitor or the court. The Act includes a carve-out for enforcement
of security financial collateral (see “—Administration,” “—Administration and floating charges,”
“—Grant of floating charge” and “—Financial Collateral Arrangements (No 2) Regulations 2003”
above) or the taking of any step to enforce a collateral security charge, which are permitted. In
contrast to a moratorium arising from an administration, a floating charge may not be crystallized
during this new moratorium, nor may any restrictions on the disposal of a floating charge asset be
imposed.

Costs incurred during a moratorium will be treated in the same way as expenses in an

administration. Where a company exits a moratorium and subsequently enters into administration
or liquidation within a 12-week period, any unpaid moratorium debts and any pre-moratorium
debts for which the company did not have a payment holiday (save for financial debt accelerated
during the moratorium), as well as any prescribed fees or expenses of the official receiver acting


-----

in any capacity in relation to the company, will have super-priority over any costs or claims in the
administration or liquidation (except for claims of fixed charge creditors to the extent such
creditors can be paid out of the assets charged and any fees and expenses of the official receiver).

A moratorium will last for an initial period of 20 business days, which may be extended

for a further 20 business days by the directors of the company. Where an extension is proposed,
statements from the directors and the monitor must be filed with the court confirming that the
qualifying conditions continue to be met. Further extensions (beyond 40 business days) will be
available:

i. pursuant to an out-of-court filing for a period of up to one year from commencement, if
more than 50% (by value) of secured and more than 50% (by value) of unsecured creditors
vote in favor of the extension, unless in both cases, more than 50% (by number) of
unconnected secured and unsecured creditors vote against the extension. Only creditors
with pre-moratorium debt in respect of which the company has a payment holiday, which
has fallen due or may fall due before the proposed revised end date of the moratorium, will
have the right to vote;

ii. pursuant to an application by the directors to court for such period as the court sees fit;

iii. in connection with a company voluntary arrangement until the proposal is implemented,

accepted or rejected by creditors or withdrawn by the company; and

iv. at the court’s discretion in connection with a scheme of arrangement or restructuring plan.

_(b)_ _Ipso Facto Clauses Prohibited_

The Act introduced a permanent prohibition on the enforcement of certain termination

clauses and the imposition of certain amended terms by a supplier in contracts for goods and
services, which would have been triggered by the commencement of insolvency proceedings
against the counterparty company. Such proceedings include winding up and administration, as
well as the new moratorium and restructuring plan. Other rights to terminate under the contract
(i.e., other than on the counterparty’s insolvency) are preserved, to the extent the termination event
arises after commencement of the insolvency proceeding. To prevent undue hardship, a supplier
may be allowed to terminate the contract if the company, the relevant insolvency practitioner or
the court consents. Financial services contracts and entities involved in financial services are not
affected by this new prohibition.

_(c)_ _Restructuring Plan_

The Act also provides for a new restructuring process, similar to a scheme of arrangement

under the Companies Act 2006, but with an ability for a cross-class cram-down to bind dissenting
stakeholders to the proposed restructuring plan. This new standalone restructuring plan is available
to any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act, excluding certain financial
market participants and any other company excluded by the Secretary of State.

The company must: (i) have encountered, or be likely to encounter, financial difficulties

that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern; and


-----

(ii) have proposed a compromise or arrangement with its creditors or members for the purpose of
eliminating, reducing, preventing or mitigating such financial difficulties. There is no financial
eligibility criteria, thereby making it available to both solvent and insolvent companies (in the
latter case, the plan would be proposed by the incumbent insolvency practitioner).

The process closely resembles that for schemes of arrangement, whereby a proposed

restructuring plan must be filed at court as part of the proponent’s application to convene a meeting
of creditors or members. At the convening hearing, the court will examine the classes of
stakeholders and whether it has jurisdiction to make judgment on the proposed restructuring plan.
Once the court is satisfied it has jurisdiction, it will order a meeting of each class of creditors or
members to vote on the proposed restructuring plan. Details of such meeting(s) must be sent to
every stakeholder in each class, accompanied by details of the plan and directors’ material interests
in the company. Creditors and members whose rights would be affected by the restructuring or
compromise arrangement must be permitted to participate in a convening meeting, unless they
have been excluded because they have no genuine economic interest in the company (which the
court may determine by reference to the “relevant alternative”, being whatever the court considers
would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring plan were not
sanctioned). Thereafter, the court may convene further stakeholder meetings, details of which must
be sent to every stakeholder in that class, accompanied by details of the plan and directors’ material
interest in the company.

The proposed restructuring plan will be voted on at the relevant creditors’ or members’

meeting, and approved if the required majority of 75% by value of the creditors or members, or
class of creditors or members present and voting either in person or by proxy, vote in favor of it.
In contrast to a scheme of arrangement, there is no requirement that a majority in number must
also vote in favor of the plan. Where a convening application is made within 12 weeks after the
end of the new standalone moratorium, any creditors in respect of “moratorium debts” and
“priority pre-moratorium debts” may not participate in the vote and may not be compromised
under the plan without their consent.

Following the creditors’ or members’ meeting(s), a sanction hearing will be held. Here, the

court will consider if the necessary plan requirements have been met and decide whether to
sanction the restructuring plan. The court has discretion to sanction a plan, even if one or more
classes of creditors or members did not vote in favor of it, thereby “cramming-down” dissenting
classes, if:

i. the court is satisfied that no creditor or member in the dissenting class(es) would be worse
off than they would be in what the court considers to be the most likely alternative scenario,
were the plan not sanctioned; and

ii. the restructuring plan has been approved by a number representing 75% by value of a class

of creditors or members who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest
in the company, in the event of the most likely alternative scenario referred to in (i) above.

A restructuring plan confirmed by the court will be binding on all affected parties, whether

they initially voted in favor of it or not. Parties’ rights following confirmation of a restructuring
plan will be as provided for in the plan and any previous rights will be extinguished. If a company


-----

subsequently entered an insolvency procedure after the failure of a restructuring plan, the rights
and claims of any creditors bound by the failed plan would be as set out in the plan. Any debt
forgiveness would therefore be binding in the subsequent insolvency.

_(d)_ _Modification of Wrongful Trading_

The Act provided for a temporary modification to the application of liability for wrongful

trading by directors with retrospective effect from March 1, 2020 until September 30, 2020. While
this temporary modification lapsed after September 30, 2020, it was revived in the Corporate
Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus) (Suspension of Liability for Wrongful
Trading and Extension of the Relevant Period) Regulations 2020 and thereafter extended pursuant
to the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus) (Extension of the Relevant
Period) Regulations 2021, so that it applies from November 26, 2020 until June 30, 2021 (subject
to extension). Wrongful trading provisions create an offense for a director of a company that enters
insolvent liquidation or administration to continue to trade when they knew or ought to have known
prior to the commencement of the insolvent liquidation or administration that there was no
reasonable prospect of avoiding insolvent liquidation or administration.

These temporary measures are intended to protect directors from personal liability where

they make decisions to continue trading at a time when the risk of insolvency as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic is high. Pursuant to these provisions, the court is required to assume that a
director is not responsible for any worsening of the financial position of the company or its
creditors that occurs during the relevant period. There is no requirement to show that the
company’s worsening financial position was due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Other provisions
aimed at preventing director misconduct (such as fraudulent trading under Section 213 of the
Insolvency Act, general duties of directors under the Companies Act 2006 and common law
fiduciary duties) continue to apply.

This temporary modification to the application of liability for wrongful trading by directors

will not apply to directors of certain entities, including insurers, banks, securitization companies,
parties to capital markets arrangements and overseas entities with functions corresponding to these.

_(e)_ _No winding up petitions or orders_

The Act, in tandem with the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus)

(Extension of the Relevant Period) Regulations 2021, has temporarily suspended the ability of
creditors to present a winding up petition during the period between April 27, 2020 and June 30,
2021 (subject to extension) on the basis of a company’s inability to pay its debts, unless the creditor
has reasonable grounds to believe that COVID-19 did not have a financial effect on the company
or that the company’s inability to pay its debts would have existed even if COVID-19 had not had
a financial effect on the company. With regards to petitions that have been presented during this
period but before the Act came into force, the court can make such order as it thinks appropriate
to restore the position to what it would have been if the petition had not been presented. This could
lead to the voiding of winding up orders made in respect of such petitions.

Similarly, no winding up orders may be made by the courts during this period on the basis

of an inability to pay debts if: (i) it appears to the court that COVID-19 had a financial effect on


-----

the company before the presentation of the petition, and (ii) the court is not satisfied that the
inability to pay debts would have existed even if COVID-19 had not had a financial effect on the
company. Any winding up orders made during this period but before the Act came into force will
be void and the court can give directions to the insolvency official to restore the company to its
“pre-petition” position.

_(f)_ _Statutory demands_

Under the Act (as amended by the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020

(Coronavirus) (Extension of the Relevant Period) Regulations 2021), as from April 27, 2020 the
presentation of a winding up petition will not be permitted on the basis of a statutory demand
served during the period between March 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (subject to extension). This
applies whether or not COVID-19 had an impact on the company’s failure to discharge the
demand.

_(g)_ _So-called “Henry VIII” powers_

The Act (as amended by the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus)

(Change of Expiry Date) Regulations 2021) further confers on the U.K. government some
extensive powers to make a range of further amendments to corporate insolvency and governance
legislation under delegated regulations until April 29, 2022. For example, regulations may be made
to amend or modify the conditions that must be met before an insolvency procedure applies to
certain entities, or the way in which the procedure applies, or to change or disapply a person’s
corporate duties and liabilities.

**_Extortionate credit transaction_**

An administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit

transaction. A transaction is “extortionate” if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person
providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to
be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the
credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing.

It is presumed, unless otherwise proved by the person extending the credit, that a

transaction with respect to which an administrator or liquidator makes an application to set aside
an extortionate credit transaction is extortionate. The court can make an order in relation to
extortionate credit transactions entered into by a company up to three years before the day on
which a company entered into administration or went into liquidation. That order may set aside,
either in whole or in part, any obligation created by the transaction (which could include
obligations of sureties). It may also vary the terms of the transaction or the terms of any security
for the purposes of the transaction. The court may require any party to the transaction to repay to
the liquidator or administrator sums already paid under the transaction and it may order the
surrender of any security held for the purpose of the transaction. It should be noted that there are
no provisions for the protection of third parties who acquire interests in the extortionate credit
transaction (e.g., assignees of the benefit of the transaction from the person who provided credit
under it).


-----

**_Foreign currency_**

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim

for their debts, the office-holder will convert all foreign currency denominated proofs of debt into
pound sterling at a single rate for each currency determined by the office-holder by reference to
the exchange rates prevailing on the relevant date. This provision overrides any agreement between
the parties. If a creditor considers the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply to the court.

Accordingly, in the event that an English obligor goes into liquidation or administration,

holders of the Notes may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date on which such English
obligor goes into liquidation or administration and receipt of any amounts to which such holders
of the Notes may become entitled.

**_Security over shares_**

Security over shares granted by an English obligor or over shares of the English obligor

are typically, under English law, equitable charges, not legal charges. An equitable charge arises
where a chargor creates an encumbrance over the property in favor of the chargee but the chargor
retains legal title to the shares. Remedies in relation to equitable charges may be subject to
equitable considerations or may otherwise be at the discretion of the court.

**_Limitation on enforcement_**

The grant of a guarantee or security by an English company in respect of the obligations

of another group company must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a
transaction must be allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association.
To the extent that the above do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the
guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights
unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with an English
company in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its
interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English company in question
by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006
provides that a director must act in the way that he or she considers, in good faith, would be most
likely to promote the success of the English company for the benefit of its members as a whole. If
the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may
be found as abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being
set aside by a court.

**Certain ERISA considerations**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with an investment in the

Notes (or any interest therein) by (i) “employee benefit plans” within the meaning of Section 3(3)
of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) that are
subject to Title I of ERISA, (ii) plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements that
are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, (iii) plans, accounts and other arrangements subject to
provisions under any U.S. or non-U.S. federal, state, local or other laws or regulations that are
similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively, “Similar Laws”), and (iv) entities
whose underlying assets are considered to include the assets of the foregoing described in clauses
(i), (ii) and (iii) pursuant to ERISA, the Code or otherwise (each of the foregoing described in
clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), collectively, referred to herein as a “Plan”).

This summary is based on the provisions of ERISA and the Code (and the related

regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations) as of the date hereof. This summary
does not purport to be complete, and no assurance can be given that future legislation, court
decisions, administrative regulations, rulings or administrative pronouncements will not
significantly modify the requirements summarized herein. Any such changes may be retroactive
and may thereby apply to transactions entered into prior to the date of their enactment or release.

**General fiduciary matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject

to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (referred to herein as a “Covered Plan”) and
prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of a Covered Plan and its fiduciaries or other
interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary
authority or control over the administration of such a Covered Plan or the management or
disposition of the assets of such a Covered Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or
other compensation to such a Covered Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the
Covered Plan.

In considering the acquisition of the Notes with a portion of the assets of any Plan, a

fiduciary should consider (among other matters) whether the investment is in accordance with the
documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code
or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the
prudence, diversification, delegation of control, conflicts of interest and prohibited transaction
provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws and whether the investment
is permitted under the terms of the applicable documents governing the Plan.

**Prohibited transaction issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit Covered Plans from engaging

in specified transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,”
within the meaning of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of
the Code, unless an exemption is available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged
in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and
liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of a Covered Plan that engaged in


-----

a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and
the Code.

For example, the acquisition, holding and/or disposition of the Notes by a Covered Plan

with respect to which the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser or a Guarantor or any of their respective
affiliates or representatives is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute
or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section
4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired, held and disposed of in accordance with an
applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S.
Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or “PTCEs,” that may
potentially provide exempted relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the
sale, acquisition and holding of the Notes.

These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions

determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance
company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds,
PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting
transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA
and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of
ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions, provided that neither the issuers of
the securities nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) have or exercise any discretionary
authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any Covered Plan
involved in the transaction and provided, further, that the Covered Plan receives no less, nor pays
no more, than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction.

Each of the above noted exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its application.

Fiduciaries of Covered Plans considering investing in the Notes (in reliance on these or any other
exemption should carefully review such exemptions to ensure their applicability). There can be no
assurance that any of the foregoing exemptions or any other exemption will be available with
respect to investment in the Notes or that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be
satisfied with respect to all otherwise prohibited transactions that might arise in connection with
such investment.

Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be acquired or held by any person investing

the assets of any Plan, unless such investment will not constitute or result in a non-exempt
prohibited transaction under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or similar violation of any
applicable Similar Laws.

Government plans, foreign plans and certain church plans, while not subject to the

prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, may
nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws. Fiduciaries of such Plans should consult with their counsel
before acquiring the Notes.

**Representation**

Accordingly, by acceptance and holding of a Note, each acquirer and subsequent transferee

of a Note (or any interest therein) will be deemed to have represented and warranted that either (i)


-----

it is not, and is not acting on behalf of, and no portion of the assets used by such acquirer or
transferee to acquire or hold the Notes (or any interest therein) constitutes assets of, any Plan or
(ii) the acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition of the Notes or any interest therein by such
acquirer or transferee will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or similar violation under any applicable
Similar Laws.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive. Due to

the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in nonexempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons
considering acquiring the Notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their
counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar
Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the acquisition and
holding of the Notes.

Acquirers have exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their acquisition and holding of

the Notes do not violate the fiduciary or prohibited transaction rules of ERISA, the Code or any
applicable Similar Laws. The sale of any Notes to a Plan is in no respect a representation or
recommendation to a Plan by the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser or a Guarantor or any of their
respective affiliates or representatives that such an investment meets all legal requirements with
respect to such investments by any such Plan generally or any particular Plan, or that such
investment is appropriate or advisable for such Plans generally or any particular Plan. Neither this
discussion nor anything provided in this Offering Memorandum is or is intended to be investment
advice directed at any potential Plan acquirers or Plan acquirers generally and such acquirers of
any Notes should consult and rely on their own counsel and advisers as to whether an investment
in the Notes is suitable for the Plan.


-----

**Transfer restrictions**

Each prospective purchaser of the Notes is advised to consult legal counsel prior to making

any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of any of the Notes offered hereby. The Notes have not
been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable securities
laws, and may not be offered, sold or delivered in the United States or to, or for the account or
benefit of, any U.S. person, except pursuant to an effective registration statement or in a transaction
not subject to the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act or in accordance with an
applicable exemption from the registration requirements and those other laws. Accordingly, the
Notes are being offered and sold only (i) to qualified institutional buyers in a private sale exempt
from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act pursuant to Rule 144A and any other
applicable securities laws and (ii) to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions outside the United
States in compliance with Regulation S.

In addition, until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the Offering of the Notes

and the Issue Date, an offer or sale of the Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or
not participating in the Offering of the Notes) may violate the registration requirements of the U.S.
Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144A.

We use the terms “offshore transaction,” “U.S. person” and “United States” with the

meanings given to them in Regulation S.

Each purchase of Notes is subject to restrictions on transfer as summarized below. By

purchasing Notes, each purchaser will be deemed to have made the following acknowledgements,
representations to and agreements with us and the Initial Purchaser:

(1) The purchaser understands and acknowledges that:

(i) the Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act
or any other securities laws and are being offered for resale in transactions that
do not require registration under the U.S. Securities Act or any other securities
laws; and

(ii) unless so registered, the Notes may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred
except under an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable
securities laws, and in each case in compliance with the conditions for transfer
set forth in paragraph (3) below.

(2) The purchaser is not an affiliate (as defined in Rule 144) of ours, that the purchaser is not
acting on its behalf and that either:

(i) the purchaser is a qualified institutional buyer (as defined in Rule 144A), is
aware that the sale to it is being made in reliance on Rule 144A and is purchasing
Notes for its own account or for the account of another qualified institutional
buyer; or


-----

(ii) the purchaser is not a U.S. person (as defined in Regulation S) nor is it acquiring
the Notes for the account or benefit of a U.S. person and is acquiring the Notes
in an offshore transaction outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S.

(3) The purchaser represents that it is purchasing Notes for its own account, or for one or more
investor accounts for which it is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case not with a view
to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution of the Notes in violation of the
U.S. Securities Act, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property
or the property of that investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control
and subject to its or their ability to resell the Notes pursuant to Rule 144A or any other
available exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities Act. The purchaser agrees
on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is purchasing the Notes,
and each subsequent holder of the Notes by its acceptance of the Notes will agree, that until
the end of the Resale Restriction Period (as defined below), the Notes may be offered, sold
or otherwise transferred only: (a) to the Issuer, the Guarantors or any subsidiary thereof;
(b) under a registration statement that has been declared effective under the U.S. Securities
Act; (c) for so long as the Notes are eligible for resale under Rule 144A, to a person the
seller reasonably believes is a qualified institutional buyer that purchases for its own
account or for the account of a qualified institutional buyer and to whom notice is given
that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A; (d) pursuant to an offshore
transaction to non-U.S. persons that occur outside the United States within the meaning of
Regulation S; or (e) under any other available exemption from the registration requirements
of the U.S. Securities Act; subject in each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of law
that the disposition of the seller’s property or the property of an investor account or
accounts be at all times within the seller or account’s control and to compliance with any
applicable U.S. state securities laws and any applicable local laws and regulations.

The purchaser also acknowledges that:

(i) the above restrictions on resale will apply until the date that is one year (in the
case of Rule 144A Notes) or 40 days (in the case of Regulation S Notes) after
the later of the Issue Date, the issue date of the issuance of any additional Notes,
and the last date on which we or any of our affiliates was the owner of the Notes
or any predecessor of the Notes (the “Resale Restriction Period”), and will not
apply after the applicable Resale Restriction Period ends;

(ii) we and the Trustee reserve the right to require in connection with any offer, sale

or other transfer of Notes (x) under clause (d) or (e) above, the delivery of an
opinion of counsel, certifications and/or other information satisfactory to us and
the Trustee and (y) under clauses (a) through (e) above, the delivery of a
completed certificate of transfer in the form appearing on the reverse side of the
security from the transferor to the Trustee; and

(iii) each note will contain a legend substantially to the following effect:

laws or regulations that are similar to the provisions of ERISA or the Code
(collectively, “Similar Laws”), or (iii) entity whose underlying assets are
considered to include the assets of any such plan, account and arrangement
described in clauses (i) and (ii) (each of the foregoing described in clauses (i),
(ii) and (iii) referred to as a “Plan”) or (b) the acquisition, holding and
subsequent disposition of the Notes or any interest therein will not constitute or
result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code or similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws.

(4) The purchaser represents that the purchaser is not a “EEA retail investor.” For the purposes
of this paragraph, the expression “EEA retail investor” means a person who is one (or more)
of the following:

(i) a “retail client” as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II;

(ii) a “customer” within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where

that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10)
of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or

(iii) not a “qualified investor” as defined in the Prospectus Regulation.

(5) The purchaser represents that the purchaser is not a “U.K. retail investor.” For the purposes
of this paragraph, the expression “U.K. retail investor” means a person who is one (or
more) of the following:

(i) a “retail client”, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/565
as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA;

(ii) a “customer” within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules
or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution
Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as
defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) 600/2014 as it forms part
of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or


-----

(iii) not a “qualified investor” as defined in Article 2 of the U.K. Prospectus

Regulation.

(6) The purchaser understands and acknowledges that:

(i) the Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and
should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any “EEA retail
investor” (as defined in paragraph (4) above) in the EEA;

(ii) no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or
selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to EEA retail investors in
the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to any EEA retail investor in the EEA may be
unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation;

(iii) the Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and

should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any “U.K. retail
investor” (as defined in paragraph (5) above) in the U.K.; and

(iv) no key information document required by the U.K. PRIIPs Regulation for

offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to U.K. retail
investors in the U.K. has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the
Notes or making them available to any U.K. retail investor in the U.K. may be
unlawful under the U.K. PRIIPs Regulation.

(7) The purchaser understands and acknowledges that, in the event Additional Notes are issued
pursuant to Regulation S that bear the same ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other
securities identification number as Notes belonging to the same series previously issued,
without being fungible with such series of initial Notes for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes that form part of that
series, including in respect of investors that hold Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S
Global Notes on or prior to the date of issuance of such Additional Notes, will not be
eligible for transfer to Book-Entry Interests in a Rule 144A Global Note (if any)
representing Notes of that same series.

**Plan of distribution**

Subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Purchase Agreement among the Issuer,

the Guarantors and the Initial Purchaser, dated the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer
will agree to sell the Notes to the Initial Purchaser, and the Initial Purchaser will agree to purchase
from the Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Notes.

The Initial Purchaser initially proposes to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that

appears on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum. After the initial offering, the Initial
Purchaser may change the price at which the Notes are offered and any other selling terms at any
time without notice. The Initial Purchaser may offer and sell Notes through certain of its affiliates.
To the extent the Initial Purchaser is not a U.S. registered broker-dealer, it will only offer and sell
Notes in the United States through one or more U.S. registered broker-dealers or affiliates, as
appropriate. In addition, the Initial Purchaser may offer and sell Notes outside the United States
through its affiliates.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchaser to pay for

and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain
legal opinions by their counsel and the Issuer’s counsel.

In the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer and the Guarantors have agreed:

    - The Issuer will pay the Initial Purchaser a commission and pay certain fees and
expenses relating to the Offering of the Notes. During the period from the date of this
Offering Memorandum through and including the date that is 90 days thereafter, neither
the Company nor any of its subsidiaries or other controlled affiliates will, without the
prior written consent of the Initial Purchaser, offer, sell, contract to sell, issue or
otherwise dispose of any debt securities, issued or guaranteed by the Issuer or any of
the Guarantors and having a tenor of more than one year (other than the Notes and the
Guarantees).

    - To indemnify the Initial Purchaser against certain liabilities, including liabilities under
the U.S. Securities Act, or contribute to payments that the Initial Purchaser may be
required to make in respect of those liabilities.

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S.

Securities Act, or the securities laws of any jurisdiction, may not be offered or sold within the
United States except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A and to non-U.S.
persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S. Terms used in this paragraph have
the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under
“Transfer restrictions.”

In connection with the sales outside the United States, the Initial Purchaser has agreed that

it will not offer, sell or deliver the Notes to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (1) as
part of the initial distribution at any time or (2) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the
commencement of the Offering or the date the Notes were originally issued. The Initial Purchaser
will send to each dealer to whom it sells such Notes during such 40-day period a confirmation or


-----

other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes within the United States
by a dealer or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons.

In addition, with respect to Notes initially sold pursuant to Regulation S, until 40 days after

the commencement of the Offering of the Notes, an offer or sale of such Notes within the United
States by a dealer that is not participating in the Offering of the Notes may violate the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance
with Rule 144A or pursuant to another exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities Act.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchaser may be required to pay stamp duty,

taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in
addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page hereof.

The Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it:

    - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or
cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment
activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection
with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA
does not apply to the Issuer or the Guarantors; and

    - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect
to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the U.K.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any

member state of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation
from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This Offering Memorandum is
not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation and any relevant implementing
measure in each member state of the EEA. No prospectus is required in accordance with the
Prospectus Regulation for this issue of Notes. The expression “Prospectus Regulation” means
Regulation (EU) 2017/1129.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in

the U.K. will be made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation and the
FSMA from a requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of securities. This Offering
Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the UK Prospectus Regulation. No prospectus
is required in accordance with the UK Prospectus Regulation for this issue of Notes. The
expression “UK Prospectus Regulation” means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the U.K., by

us or the Initial Purchaser that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession,
circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the
Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may
not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other
offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published,
in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and


-----

regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an
offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or
solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes
are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering of
the Notes, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Notice to
_investors” and “Transfer restrictions.”_

The Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise

made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Notes to any retail investor
in the EEA. For these purposes, the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or
more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer
within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify
as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a “qualified
investor” as defined in the Prospectus Regulation.

The Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise

made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Notes to any retail investor
in the U.K. For these purposes, the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or
more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as
it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the
provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the
Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client,
as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic
law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a “qualified investor” as defined in Article 2 of the U.K.
Prospectus Regulation.

The Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell,

contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under
circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption
afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and
Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes. The Issuer and Guarantors
have also agreed that neither they, nor any of their affiliates or any other person acting on its or
their behalf (other than the Initial Purchaser), will (i) solicit offers for, or offer or sell, the Notes
by means of any form of general solicitation or general advertising within the meaning of Rule
502(c) of Regulation D or in any manner involving a public offering within the meaning of Section
4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities Act or (ii) engage in any directed selling efforts within the meaning
of Regulation S, and all such persons will comply with the offering restrictions requirement of
Regulation S.

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. The Issuer

will apply, through the listing agent, for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the
Official List of the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the Notes will be listed and admitted
to trade on the Official List of the Exchange. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our structure—
_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the_
_Notes may be limited” and “Risk factors— Risks related to our financial profile, the Notes and the_
_Guarantees—The transferability of the Notes may be limited under applicable securities laws.”_


-----

The Initial Purchaser has advised the Issuer that it intends to make a market in the Notes

as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchaser is not obligated, however, to make a market
in the Notes, and any market making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion
of the Initial Purchaser without notice. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject
to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act.

Accordingly, the Issuer cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that

it will be liquid if it does develop or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or
at a price that will be favorable to you.

The Initial Purchaser may engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions, covering

transactions and penalty bids in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Overallotment
involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchaser.
Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the
stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of
the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short
positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchaser to reclaim a selling concession from a broker
or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or
covering transaction to cover short positions.

In connection with the Offering, Barclays Bank PLC (the “Stabilizing Manager”), or any

person acting on its behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect
the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in the
open markets for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. The
Stabilizing Manager may also over allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may
bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition,
the Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in market making transactions as
permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may
stabilize or maintain the market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail.
The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities
at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for,
the Notes. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our structure—There may not be an active trading
_market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the prices

of the Notes to be higher than they would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These
transactions may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the
Offering of the Notes is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole
discretion of the Initial Purchaser. If these activities are commenced, they must end no later than
the earlier of 30 days after the date on which the Issuer receives the proceeds of the Notes offered
hereby and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected
in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.

The Issuer expects that the delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on

or about the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be the fifth
business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement cycle being herein referred
to as “T+  ” (U.S. Business Days)). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in


-----

the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any
such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade Notes on the date
of pricing or the next   business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially
will settle T+ , to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent
a failed settlement. Purchasers of Notes who wish to trade Notes on the date of pricing or the next
two business days should consult their advisors.

The Initial Purchaser and/or its affiliates may have from time to time engaged, and may in

the future engage, in investment banking, commercial banking, consulting, mergers and
acquisitions, hedging and other financial advisory and commercial services with the Company and
its subsidiaries, its associates and/or its shareholders in the ordinary course of business (including
acting as initial purchasers and/or lenders in connection with previous issuances of debt securities
and debt facilities to the Company and its subsidiaries). It may have received (or will receive)
customary fees and commissions and expense reimbursements for these transactions.

In addition, in the ordinary course of its business activities, the Initial Purchaser and/or its

affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity
securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for its
own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities
may involve securities and/or instruments of the Company or its affiliates (including the Notes).
The Initial Purchaser and/or its affiliates that have a lending relationship with the Company or its
affiliates or which acquire the Notes for their own account or otherwise may hedge their credit
exposure to the Company and/or its affiliates, consistent with their customary risk management
policies. Typically, the Initial Purchaser and its affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering
into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of
short positions in securities (including potentially the Notes). Any such short positions could
adversely affect future trading prices of Notes. The Initial Purchaser and its affiliates may also
make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in
respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they
acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

The Initial Purchaser may be, or may become in the future, a client of the Company or use

its services.

The proceeds of the Notes, together with the proceeds from certain other equity financing

transactions described herein, will be used (i) to repay existing indebtedness, (ii) for general
corporate purposes, including working capital requirements, capital expenditures and strategic
acquisitions, and (iii) to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Offering. See “Use
_of proceeds.”_

The Initial Purchaser and/or its affiliates is a mandated lead arranger, bookrunner and

original lender under our New Revolving Facilities Agreement and a revolving arranger and
revolving lender under our Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of other financial
_arrangements.”_

**Where you can find more information**

Each purchaser of the Notes from the Initial Purchaser will be furnished with a copy of this

Offering Memorandum and, to the extent provided to the Initial Purchaser by the Issuer, any related
amendment or supplement to this Offering Memorandum. Each person receiving this Offering
Memorandum acknowledges that:

    - such person has been afforded an opportunity to request from us, and to review and has
received, all additional information considered by it to be necessary to verify the
accuracy and completeness of the information herein;

    - such person has not relied on the Initial Purchaser or any person affiliated with the
Initial Purchaser in connection with its investigation of the accuracy of such
information or its investment decisions; and

    - except as provided pursuant to the first bullet above, no person has been authorized to
give any information or to make any representation concerning the Notes offered
hereby other than those contained herein, and, if given or made, such information or
representation should not be relied upon as having been authorized by the Company or
the Initial Purchaser.

So long as the Notes are outstanding and are “restricted securities” within the meaning of

Rule 144, we will, during any period in which we are neither subject to Section 13 of 15(d) of the
U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor exempt from reporting pursuant to Rule
12g3-2(b) of the Exchange Act, upon request, furnish to any holder or beneficial owner of the
Notes the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S.
Securities Act to permit compliance with Rule 144A in connection with resales of the Notes.

We are not currently subject to the periodic reporting and other information requirements

of the Exchange Act. However, pursuant to the Indenture governing the Notes and so long as the
Notes are outstanding, we will furnish periodic information to holders of the Notes. See
“Description of the Notes—Certain covenants—Reports.”


-----

**Enforcement of civil liabilities**

The Issuer, the Company and the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of England

and Wales. Many of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer, the Company and the Group
are nonresidents of the United States and a substantial portion of the assets of such persons are
located outside the United States. As a consequence, you may not be able to effect service of
process on these non-U.S. resident directors and officers in the United States or to enforce
judgments against them outside of the United States, including judgments of the U.S. courts
predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws. Even though the
enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United States is described below for the
countries in which each of the Issuer, the Company and the Guarantors are located, you should
consult with your own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in
those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

The United States and England currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal

recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and
commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state
court in the United States based on civil liability, would not automatically be recognized or
enforceable in England and Wales. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and
Wales, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and
Wales. In such an action, the English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the
original matter decided by the U.S. court and it would usually be possible to obtain summary
judgment on such a claim if:

  - the U.S. court had competent jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to
English rules of private international law;

  - the U.S. judgment is final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and
unalterable in the court which pronounced it and is for a definite sum of money;

  - the U.S. judgment is not for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like
nature or in respect of a penalty or fine or otherwise based on a U.S. law that an English
court considers to relate to penal, revenue or other public law;

  - the U.S. judgment does not contravene English public policy;

  - the U.S. judgment has not been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a
sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained or is not otherwise
specified in Section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (or is on a claim for
contribution in respect of either such damages) or is based on measures designated by the
Secretary of State under Section 1 of the Act;

  - the U.S. judgment has not been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of
natural justice or the principles of the European convention on Human Rights;

  - the U.S. judgment is not inconsistent with an earlier judgment in proceedings between the
same parties or their privies;


-----

  - the English enforcement proceedings were commenced within the relevant limitation
period; and

  - the U.S. judgment was not obtained contrary to an agreement for the settlement of disputes
under which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in a
United States court (to whose jurisdiction the judgment debtor did not submit).

There is doubt as to the enforceability in England and Wales of U.S. judgments in respect

of civil judgments predicated purely on U.S. securities laws.

Only subject to the foregoing may investors be able to enforce in England judgments that

have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. Notwithstanding the preceding, we cannot
assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England.

No account has been taken in the provision of this summary of the future exercise of powers

by the U.K. government pursuant to Section 5(4) of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980
nor any change in law resulting from the withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU.

**Deuce Holdco Limited**

**Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements for the Quarter ended**
**31 March 2021**

**1 General information**

The Company is a private company limited by share capital incorporated and domiciled in the United
Kingdom.

The address of its registered office is:

The Hangar
Mosquito Way
Hatfield Business Park
AL10 9AX

Deuce Holdco Limited is the holding company for David Lloyd Leisure Limited and other subsidiaries
(together ‘‘the Group’’).

**2 Significant accounting policies**

**Basis of preparation**

The financial information in these condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the quarter
ended 31 March 2021 is that of the Company and all of its subsidiaries (the Group). These interim
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial
Reporting. They do not include all disclosures that would otherwise be required in a complete set of
financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and
should be read in conjunction with the 31 December 2020 annual report.

The information for the year ended 31 December 2020 does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in
section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. A copy of the statutory accounts for that year has been delivered
to the Registrar of Companies. The auditor’s report on those accounts was not qualified, did not include a
reference to any matters to which the auditors drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying the
report and did not contain statements under section 498(2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.

**Accounting policies**

The Company has applied the same accounting policies and methods of computation in its interim
consolidated financial statements as in its 31 December 2020 annual financial statements, except in respect
of income tax, which is based on the effective tax rate that would be applicable to expected annual
earnings.

**Going concern**

In preparing the financial statements the Directors are required to assess the Group and Company’s ability
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting. In making this assessment the Directors have considered
the Group and Company’s cash flows, liquidity, and business activities as well as the potential impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic.

_Principal risk_

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was significant. Almost all the Group’s clubs were required to
close by the UK and European Governments on or before 20 March 2020. Clubs re-opened in summer
2020, but a second wave of COVID-19 in autumn 2020 led to further club closures. On average, the
Group’s clubs were closed for 5.5 months during the year-ended 31 December 2020 and at least the first
3.5 months of 2021. Whilst closed, clubs generated no income.

Whilst the success of the UK’s vaccination programme is a source of great optimism, there remains a risk
that new variants of COVID-19 could escape vaccines, causing future waves of COVID-19 that could lead
to further periods of enforced club closures casting a degree of uncertainty as to the future financial
performance and cash flows of the Group.

_Liquidity_

As of 31 March 2021, the Group’s financing arrangements consisted of a £1,018.9m loan (repayable
December 2024) and access to £40m in revolving credit facilities (‘‘RCFs’’), consisting of two separate
£20m RCFs from the Group’s relationship banks. The RCFs were fully drawn at the balance sheet date and
they remain drawn at the date of this report. The loan and RCF facilities do not have any financial
covenants attached to them.

The two RCFs have expiry dates in July 2021 with the option to extend for a further 12 months (subject to
counterparty agreement). Given the historic support provided by the Group’s lending banks (including the
renewal of these facilities during the spring 2020 lockdown) and the super-senior nature of these facilities,
the Directors are highly confident that the facilities will be renewed again in July 2021.

As of 30 April 2021, the Group had an immediately available cash balance of c. £44.4m.

The Group’s liquidity in the next eighteen months will be influenced by the debt facilities available to the
Group as well as: i) the trading performance of clubs and (ii) any further periods of club closure because of
future waves of COVID-19.

_Recent trading performance of clubs_

At 30 April 2021, the Group had 570k members (December 2020: 563k). The Group’s business model is
underpinned by affluent members who are loyal and generate significant recurring subscription income.
More than 75% of the Group’s revenues arise through member subscriptions with the majority of members
on 12 month rolling contracts requiring 3 months’ notice to cancel. Upon re-opening of clubs, the Group
has resumed collecting monthly subscriptions from its members.

The Directors believe that demand for membership remains at least as strong as it was before the
pandemic. This confidence is based on exceptionally strong sales following the first Lockdown. The Group
experienced record new member sales (NMS) months in August, September and October 2020
demonstrating strong demand for membership. Furthermore, the successful roll-out of the UK vaccination
programme has led the Directors to feel confident that the considerable restrictions caused by COVID-19
on people’s lifestyles are almost at an end.

As our clubs re-open in spring 2021, the Group is experiencing even stronger demand than in summer 2020
when considerable fears over winter COVID-19 resurgence remained. The Group’s April 2021
membership sales of 36k set a new all-time record, and this was achieved with only English clubs offering a
restricted product range for 19 days in the month.

The Directors are confident strong recent demand for the Group’s offering will continue, aided by a
number of favourable tailwinds:

- More affluent segments were relatively less impacted during the pandemic and increased household
savings rate should support a sustained period of increased leisure spending.

- 28% of DL members are in the vulnerable >50 years old category and most will have been offered the
vaccine by the time their clubs re-open.

- Restrictions on international travel mean it is likely that fewer families will take foreign holidays in
2021, increasing the pull towards the Group’s wider leisure offering including outdoor pools.

- The appeal of the Group’s suburban locations should increase with people spending an increased
proportion of time working from home post-pandemic, due to a structural shift in working habits.

_Cash Flow Forecasts_

In making their assessment of going concern the Directors have considered the forecast cash flows of the
Group and the liquidity available over an eighteen-month period ending October 2022.

**Deuce Holdco Limited**

**31 March 2021 (Continued)**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

The Group’s base case scenario assumes all UK clubs re-open (and remain open) by May 2021 with 50% of
European clubs re-opening in June (and the remainder opening in July) and that both RCFs totalling
£40m, which are currently fully drawn, are renewed in July 2021. Reflecting expected strong demand, our
base case assumes recovery of member count to 617k by September 2021 and that the Group continues to
utilise Government COVID-19 support where it is available and required. The base case also assumes the
repayment of deferred liabilities to landlords, suppliers and other creditors that were accumulated during
the closure period. Under this base case scenario the Group has sufficient cash reserves, with a low point in
January 2022 of c. £22.6m.

_Downside Scenario Testing_

The Directors have considered the impact of downside scenarios. The two scenarios were firstly the loss of
the RCFs, in the event they cannot be renewed in July 2021 and secondly further COVID-19 disruption,
were new variants to escape vaccines causing further national lockdowns, with enforced club closures,
commencing December 2021. Under the first scenario the Group does not have adequate short-term
liquidity to repay both the RCFs, so this scenario, whilst considered unlikely to arise by the Directors,
would cause a liquidity shortfall in July 2021. Under the second scenario, prior to any mitigation, a liquidity
shortfall would arise in January 2022.

In considering the output of downside scenario testing, the Directors have also considered the additional
actions which may be available to mitigate the impact on liquidity. Key mitigating actions, albeit not all
within the Directors’ control, include minimising all capital expenditure, further rent/creditor deferrals,
labour savings through a restructuring programme as well as asset liquidation through selling plant and
equipment, and sale and leasebacks of remaining freehold and long leasehold sites. Liquidity could also be
generated from the issuance of new equity. Learnings gained from club closures, and stakeholder support
received during the pandemic lead the Directors to consider their ability to deliver a level of mitigating
actions which protect liquidity to be very high.

_Conclusion_

The liquidity of the Group has been reduced as a result of many months of club closures. Whilst the
Directors believe the current COVID-19 pandemic is receding, it is too early to definitively conclude
future variants of COVID-19 will not necessitate further lockdowns and club closures which would
adversely impact the future financial performance and cash flows of the Group. Furthermore, there
remains a risk that the Group is unable to extend its RCF facilities, when they fall due for renewal in July
2021. This leads the Directors to conclude that the factors noted in the Downside Scenario Testing section
above constitute a material uncertainty which would cast significant doubt on the Group and the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and therefore, it may be unable to realise its assets and
discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.

Notwithstanding this material uncertainty, having assessed financial forecasts, likely downside scenarios
and possible mitigating actions, the Directors have formed the judgement that the Group and Company
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the next twelve months from the date of
approval of these financial statements. Therefore, the Directors have deemed it appropriate to prepare
these financial statements on the going concern basis.

**Changes in accounting policies and disclosures**

(a) New standards, amendments and interpretations

There are no amendments to accounting standards, or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the
quarter ended 31 March 2021 that have had a material impact on the Group’s interim financial statements.

(b) New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted

**Deuce Holdco Limited**

**Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements for the Quarter ended**
**31 March 2021 (Continued)**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the Group has not applied the following new and
revised IFRS Standards that have been issued but are not yet effective:

- IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts;

- Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28, Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its
Associate or Joint Venture;

- Amendments to IAS 1, Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current;

- Amendments to IFRS 3, Reference to the Conceptual Framework;

- Amendments to IAS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment—Proceeds before Intended Use;

- Amendments to IAS 37, Onerous Contracts—Cost of Fulfilling a Contract; and

- Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020 Cycle.

None of these are expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group or parent
company.

**Use of estimates and judgements**

Having considered the facts and circumstances including possible impairment indicators at 31 March 2021,
the Directors have concluded that the key judgements including impairment are consistent with those
reached as at 31 December 2020. The Directors are satisfied that there have been no material revisions to
the nature and amount of estimates of amounts reported in the key judgements in the 31 December 2020
financial statements.

**3 Significant changes in the current reporting period**

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was significant in the current reporting period. All the Group’s
UK clubs were required by the UK Governments to be closed for the first quarter of 2021. All English and
Scottish clubs opened in April and the Welsh clubs opened in May. European countries in which we
operate were also under national lockdowns meaning our European clubs were closed. Our two Spanish
clubs remained open but operated under significant restrictions.

The impact of this is discussed in the Going concern section in note 2.

**9 Income tax**

In accordance with IAS 34 Interim Reporting, the Group has applied the forecast effective tax rate for the
year ended 31 December 2021 of 7.9% (31 March 2020: �25.9%) to the three months ended 31 March
2021. This is an increase of 33.8 percentage points year-over-year which included the impact of the rate
change on UK related deferred tax, following the March 2020 Budget and substantive enactment of the
revised corporate tax rate of 19% effective from 1 April 2020 as opposed to the previously enacted 17%.

As a direct result of COVID-19, the Group has renegotiated a number of its leases of land and buildings.
During the quarter ended 31 March 2021, the Group has remeasured the lease liability with the revised
lease payments and lease term, using a revised discount rate at the effective date of the lease modification.
This has resulted in an increase in the lease liability of £0.7m, with a corresponding £0.7m adjustment to

**Deuce Holdco Limited**

**Independent Auditor’s Report to the members of Deuce Holdco Limited**

Report on the audit of the financial statements

**1.** **Opinion**

In our opinion:

- the financial statements of Deuce Holdco Limited (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the
‘Group’) give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at
31 December 2020 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended;

- the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with international
accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006;

- the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, including Financial Reporting Standard 101
‘‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’’; and

- the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements which comprise:

- the consolidated income statement;

- the consolidated statement of comprehensive income;

- the consolidated and parent company statements of financial position;

- the consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity;

- the consolidated statement of cash flows; and

- the related notes 1 to 33.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial
statements is applicable law and international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of
the Companies Act 2006. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of
the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards,
including FRS 101 ‘‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’’ (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice).

**2.** **Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and
applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor’s
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.

We are independent of the Group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements
that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting
Council’s (the ‘FRC’s’) Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in
accordance with these requirements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion.

**3.** **Material uncertainty related to going concern**

We draw attention to note 2 in the financial statements, which indicates that the liquidity of the Group has
been reduced as a result of club closures. The Group’s forecast cash position over the 12 months from the
date of approval of these accounts is sensitive to the impact of COVID-19, which is inherently uncertain.
Also, in order to meet liabilities as they fall due, it will be necessary for the RCF facilities (which are fully
drawn down at £40m) to be renewed in July 2021, or alternative financing to be made available. The Group
expects the RCFs to be renewed in July 2021, but this is not contractually committed at the date of
approval of the financial statements.

F-23


-----

As stated in note 2, these events or conditions, along with the other matters as set forth in note 2, indicate
that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s and Parent Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

In our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the Group’s and Parent Company’s ability to continue to
adopt the going concern basis of accounting, our response included the following:

- Obtained an understanding of the relevant controls that are in place over management’s going
concern assessment;

- Reviewed the terms of the financing facilities held by the Group, which at the date of signing the
financial statements was a £1,019m (2019: £947m) loan repayable in December 2024 and £40m (2019:
£40m) RCF facilities, repayable in July 2021;

- Reviewed correspondence with lenders;

- Involved our internal data modelling specialists to review the mechanics of the base case model;

- Tested the base case model and assessed the appropriateness of the key assumptions made in the
model, including assumptions around re-opening dates of clubs, member numbers, renewal of
financing facilities, continuance of government support and rent repayment dates;

- Assessed management’s historic forecasting accuracy;

- Assessed the appropriateness of the relevant sensitivities and feasibility of mitigating actions that
management have identified, the impact of these on the base case model, including assessment of
whether any further sensitivities should have been applied and for the identified mitigating actions,
the likelihood of them being achieved and whether they are within management’s control; and

- Reviewed the disclosures included in the financial statements to assess that they appropriately disclose
the assumptions made and the judgements included in the going concern assessment.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in
the relevant sections of this report.

**4.** **Summary of our audit approach**

**Key audit matters** The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:

           - Impairment of fixed assets (property, plant & equipment,
right-of-use-assets and goodwill);

           - Accuracy of lease input data for renegotiated leases;

           - Classification of maintenance or refurbishment expenditure vs capital
expenditure for clubs with material additions; and

           - Going Concern (see material uncertainty relating to going concern
section).

Within this report, key audit matters are identified as follows:


4MAY202122062600

**Materiality** The materiality that we used for the Group financial statements was
£4.8m, which was determined on the basis of the total assets.

**Scoping** Our scoping has resulted in 91% of the Group’s revenue and 91% of
total assets being subject to full audit scope.

F-24


-----

**Significant changes in our** In previous years Deloitte have determined the materiality based on
**approach** Earnings before interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation
(‘‘EBITDA’’). Given the impact of Covid-19 on the Group this year, we
reassessed the materiality benchmark and used a benchmark based on
total assets.

Our key audit matter in respect of impairment was specifically in relation
to the Dutch and Aravaca clubs in the prior year, but this year the key
audit matter is expanded to include impairment of fixed assets (PPE,
ROU assets and goodwill), which encompasses all clubs.

Our key audit matter in respect of the accuracy of lease inputs is
focussed on renegotiated leases in the year, whereas in prior year this
reflected all lease inputs, as IFRS 16 was new in the prior year.

**5.** **Key audit matters**

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our
audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of
material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those
which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and
directing the efforts of the engagement team.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

5.1. Impairment of fixed assets (Property, Plant & Equipment, Right of Use assets and goodwill) 4MAY202122062713

**Key audit matter** Management has performed an impairment review to determine if any
**description** impairment of fixed assets under IFRS is required in line with IAS 36
‘‘Impairment of Assets’’. Covid-19 led to all David Lloyd clubs being shut
for a period of time during 2020 due to local lockdowns. As a result, no
revenue was able to be generated from the clubs and therefore the risk
of impairment increased across all the clubs.

The fixed assets balances as at 31 December 2020 are £309.7m of
Property, Plant and Equipment (‘‘PPE’’), £895.4m of Right of Use
(‘‘ROU’’) assets and £118.8m of goodwill. An impairment of £28.1m was
identified, being £9.1m on PPE and £18.7m on ROU assets and £0.3m on
goodwill.

Management assessed fixed assets for impairment by comparison to their
value in use (VIU). The key judgements in the VIU calculation are as
follows:

           - The future cash flow forecasts of the individual clubs;

           - The long term growth rate; and

           - The discount rates used to discount the future cash flows to a
present value.

Refer to the significant accounting policies (page 58 to 72) and note 15
‘‘Impairment Testing’’ of the Consolidated Financial Statements
(page 82).

**matter** the following:

           - Obtained an understanding of the relevant controls surrounding the
impairment assessment;

           - Involved our internal specialists to challenge the appropriateness of
the discount rate and long-term growth rate used in the model,
including comparison of key inputs to market evidence;

           - Engaged internal modelling specialists to assess the mechanics of the
impairment model;

           - Assessed the reasonableness of the key judgments around cash flow
projections made in the value in use model against industry
expectations and historical performance;

           - Confirmed that the forecasts used in the VIU model were the latest
Board approved forecasts;

           - Tested management’s ability to accurately forecast future revenues
and growth rates by comparing actual results to management’s
historical forecasts;

           - Performed detailed analysis on the clubs deemed most at risk of
impairment;

           - Performed a sensitivity analysis on the inputs into the value in use
model to determine if this would materially change any impairment
charge currently recognised; and

           - Assessed the disclosure in the accounts, including the disclosure as a
key source of estimation uncertainty.

**Key observations** We are satisfied that management’s assessment of the impairment
recognised across PPE, ROU assets and goodwill within the Group is
appropriate.

5.2. Accuracy of lease input data for renegotiated leases 4MAY202122062940

**Key audit matter** The majority of lease contracts have been renegotiated in the year in
**description** order to improve cash flows in light of the impact of Covid-19 on the
business. The Right of Use Assets (‘‘ROU’’) have increased by £12.3m in
the year to £895.4m, and the lease liability by £86.0m to £913.7m. As a
result of the magnitude of the balances, a small difference in the inputs
could result in a material misstatement.

For every lease that has been renegotiated, the lease inputs in the
IFRS 16 model need to be manually updated to reflect the new terms,
e.g. new lease length, new payment schedules and new incremental
borrowing rates (‘‘IBR’’) where the renegotiated lease is treated as a
lease modification.

There are multiple judgements to be made around the lease inputs,
including:

           - Determining lease term, including any renewal, termination and
purchase options, as well as rent-free periods;

           - Accounting for various types of lease payments (variable and fixed);
and

           - Determination of new IBRs.

There is also a risk due to the fact that all inputs are made manually,
and an error could be made in this process.

**How the scope of our audit** The procedures performed to address the key audit matter included the
**responded to the key audit** following:
**matter**

           - Obtained an understanding of the relevant controls around the
entering of data into the model;

           - Assessed management’s paper on key judgements included in the
model, such as when to recognise an option to extend a lease, and
whether to apply the Covid-19 practical exemption in relation to rent
concessions;

           - Worked with internal specialists to evaluate the IBRs used for new
and modified leases;

           - Tested a sample of renegotiated lease contracts by obtaining the
updated lease agreement and assessing whether all the updated
details input into the model, such as start/end dates and lease
payments, were accurate; and

           - Assessed the completeness of data points in the model by confirming
whether all relevant lease inputs were captured.

**Key observations** We are satisfied that the data inputs in the IFRS 16 model are
appropriate.

5.3. Classification of refurbishment expenditure versus capital expenditure for clubs with material
additions 4MAY202122062940

**Key audit matter** At 31 December 2020 total additions to property, plant and equipment
**description** (‘‘PPE’’) during the year were £23.6m (2019: £79.1m).

The classification of maintenance and refurbishment expenditure versus
capitalised expenditure has been identified as a key audit matter due to
the level of judgement involved in determining whether an item is capital
in nature or not. If it is determined that an item is capital in nature, it
will be capitalised to PPE, with the related annual depreciation charge
not being included in adjusted EBITDA. Any maintenance expenditure
will be recognised in full within adjusted EBITDA during the year the
expense was incurred.

Adjusted EBITDA is a key performance indicator for the Group and
therefore we have identified manipulation of these costs as a potential
area for fraud.

Refer to the significant accounting policies (page 58 to 72) and note 16
‘‘Property, Plant & Equipment’’ of the Consolidated Financial Statements
(page 84).

**How the scope of our audit** The procedures performed to address the key audit matter included the
**responded to the key audit** following:
**matter**

           - Obtained an understanding of the relevant controls around the
maintenance and refurbishment expenditure, capital expenditure and
purchasing processes;

           - Tested general IT controls around the user access and change
management in the system;

           - Tested a sample of costs capitalised in the year across all clubs with
material additions to assess whether they met the capitalisation
criteria of IAS 16;

           - Tested a sample of journals posted to the maintenance and
refurbishment expenditure account in the Income Statement to
evaluate the appropriateness of each item; and

           - Performed analytical review procedures to assess if material
additions were in line with expectation on a club-by-club basis, for
the entities scoped in our audit.

**Key observations** We are satisfied that the classification of costs as property, plant and
equipment assets capitalised in the year is appropriate.

**6.** **Our application of materiality**

6.1. Materiality

We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable
that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We
use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as
follows:

**Group financial statements** **Parent company financial statements**

**Materiality** £4.8m (2019: £6.7m) £1.9m (2019: £5.4m)

**Basis for determining** We determined materiality based The determined materiality equates

**6.2. Performance materiality**

We set performance materiality at a level lower than materiality to reduce the probability that, in
aggregate, uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceed the materiality for the financial statements
as a whole.

**Group financial statements** **Parent company financial statements**

**Performance materiality** 65% (2019: 70%) of Group 65% (2019: 70%) of parent

**Basis and rationale for** In determining performance materiality, we considered factors including:
**determining performance**

           - our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment;
**materiality**

           - the low number of corrected and uncorrected misstatements in the
previous audit; and

           - the significant impact that Covid-19 has had on the business in the
year.

We reduced the performance materiality from 70% of Group materiality
to 65% of Group materiality to reflect the impact of Covid-19 on the
business.

6.3. Error reporting threshold

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess
of £240k (2019: £335k), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting
on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified
when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.

**7.** **An overview of the scope of our audit**

7.1. Identification and scoping of components

Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including
group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. The Group
operates clubs principally in the UK, but also elsewhere in Europe, and has a centralised finance function
operating in the UK.

Our audit scoping has resulted in 91% (2019: 99%) of the Group’s revenue and 91% of total assets
(2019:100%).

At the Group level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to
confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement on the aggregated
financial information of the remaining components not subject to full scope audit procedures.

All audit work was performed by the Group audit team.

**8.** **Other information**

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial
statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information
contained within the annual report.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent
otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other
information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the
course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to
determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If,
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other
information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

**9.** **Responsibilities of directors**

As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for
such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the
parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the
Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

**10. Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the
basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the
FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s
report.

**11. Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud**

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design
procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of
irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities,
including fraud is detailed below.

11.1. Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities

In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and
non-compliance with laws and regulations, we considered the following:

- the nature of the industry and sector, control environment and business performance including the
design of the Group’s remuneration policies, key drivers for directors’ remuneration, bonus levels and
performance targets;

- the Group’s own assessment of the risks that irregularities may occur either as a result of fraud or
error that was approved by the board;

F-30


-----

- results of our enquiries of management and the audit committee about their own identification and
assessment of the risks of irregularities;

- any matters we identified having obtained and reviewed the Group’s documentation of their policies
and procedures relating to:

  - identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of
any instances of non-compliance;

  - detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual,
suspected or alleged fraud;

  - the internal controls established to mitigate risks of fraud or non-compliance with laws and
regulations;

- the matters discussed among the audit engagement team and relevant internal specialists, including
tax, valuations and IT, regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any
potential indicators of fraud.

As a result of these procedures, we considered the opportunities and incentives that may exist within the
organisation for fraud and identified the greatest potential for fraud in the following areas: Classification
of refurbishment expenditure versus capital expenditure and impairment of fixed assets (PPE, ROU assets
and goodwill), as detailed in the key audit matters section of this report. In common with all audits under
ISAs (UK), we are also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of management
override.

We also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that the Group operates in,
focusing on provisions of those laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the determination of
material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The key laws and regulations we considered
in this context included the UK Companies Act and relevant tax legislation.

In addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the
financial statements but compliance with which may be fundamental to the Group’s ability to operate or to
avoid a material penalty.

11.2. Audit response to risks identified

As a result of performing the above, we identified Classification of refurbishment expenditure versus
capital expenditure and impairment of fixed assets (PPE, ROU assets and goodwill) as key audit matters
related to the potential risk of fraud. The key audit matters section of our report explains the matter in
more detail and also describes the specific procedures we performed in response to these key audit
matters.

In addition to the above our procedures to respond to risks identified included the following:

- reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess
compliance with provisions of relevant laws and regulations described as having a direct effect on the
financial statements;

- enquiring of management, the audit committee and external legal counsel concerning actual and
potential litigation and claims;

- performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may
indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud;

- reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports and
reviewing correspondence with HMRC; and

- in addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, testing the appropriateness
of journal entries and other adjustments; assessing whether the judgements made in making
accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias; and evaluating the business rationale of any
significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business.

We also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement
team members including internal specialists, and remained alert to any indications of fraud or
non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

**12. Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006**

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

- the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which
the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

- the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the parent company and their
environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the
strategic report or the directors’ report.

**13. Matters on which we are required to report by exception**

13.1. Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

- we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

- adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our
audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

- the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and
returns.

We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

13.2. Directors’ remuneration

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of
directors’ remuneration have not been made.

We have nothing to report in respect of this matter.

**14. Use of our report**

This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of
the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we
have formed.

Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations as adopted
by the European Union, and with the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard
101, ‘‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’’ (FRS101).

The consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost
convention, as modified by the revaluation of derivative financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value
through profit and loss, and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the
Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas
where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in
note 3.

As permitted by FRS101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available in
relation to presentation of a cash flow statement; standards not yet effective; business combinations;
non-current assets held for sale; presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets;
impairment of assets; and related party transactions.

**Basis of consolidation**

The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary
undertakings drawn up to 31 December 2020.

No income statement is presented for the Company as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act
2006. The Company made a profit after tax for the financial year of £122,000 (2019: £179,000).

Where the Group has control over an investee, it is classified as a subsidiary. The Group controls an
investee if all three of the following elements are present: power over the investee, exposure to variable
returns from the investee and the ability of the investor to use its power to affect those variable returns.
Control is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these
elements of control.

The consolidated financial statements present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries (‘‘the
Group’’) as if they formed a single entity. Intergroup transactions and balances between Group companies
are therefore eliminated in full. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are
included in the income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of

disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries
to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by the Group.

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the
acquisition method. In the statement of financial position, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related
costs are expensed as incurred.

**Going Concern**

In preparing the financial statements the Directors are required to assess the Group and Company’s ability
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting. In making this assessment the Directors have considered
the Group and Company’s cash flows, liquidity, and business activities as well as the potential impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic.

_Principal risk_

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was significant. Almost all the Group’s clubs were required to
close by the UK and European Governments on or before 20 March 2020. Clubs re-opened in summer
2020, but a second wave of COVID-19 in autumn 2020 led to further club closures. On average, the
Group’s clubs were closed for 5.5 months during the year-ended 31 December 2020 and at least the first
3.5 months of 2021. Whilst closed, clubs generated no income.

Whilst the success of the UK’s vaccination programme is a source of great optimism, there remains a risk
that new variants of COVID-19 could escape vaccines, causing future waves of COVID-19 that could lead
to further periods of enforced club closures casting a degree of uncertainty as to the future financial
performance and cash flows of the Group.

_Liquidity_

As of 31 December 2020, the Group’s financing arrangements consisted of a £1,018.9m loan (repayable
December 2024) and access to £40m in revolving credit facilities (‘‘RCFs’’), consisting of two separate
£20m RCFs from the Group’s relationship banks. The RCFs were fully drawn at the balance sheet date and
they remain drawn at the date of this report. The loan and RCF facilities do not have any financial
covenants attached to them.

The two RCFs have expiry dates in July 2021 with the option to extend for a further 12 months (subject to
counterparty agreement). Given the historic support provided by the Group’s lending banks (including the
renewal of these facilities during the spring 2020 lockdown) and the super-senior nature of these facilities,
the Directors are highly confident that the facilities will be renewed again in July 2021.

As of 30 April 2021, the Group had an immediately available cash balance of c. £44.4m.

The Group’s liquidity in the next eighteen months will be influenced by the debt facilities available to the
Group as well as: i) the trading performance of clubs and (ii) any further periods of club closure because of
future waves of COVID-19.

_Recent trading performance of clubs_

At 30 April 2021, the Group had 570k members (December 2020: 563k). The Group’s business model is
underpinned by affluent members who are loyal and generate significant recurring subscription income.
More than 75% of the Group’s revenues arise through member subscriptions with the majority of members
on 12 month rolling contracts requiring 3 months’ notice to cancel. Upon re-opening of clubs, the Group
has resumed collecting monthly subscriptions from its members.

The Directors believe that demand for membership remains at least as strong as it was before the
pandemic. This confidence is based on exceptionally strong sales following the first Lockdown. The Group
experienced record new member sales (NMS) months in August, September and October 2020

F-40

**Deuce Holdco Limited**

**Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year ended 31 December 2020 (Continued)**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

demonstrating strong demand for membership. Furthermore, the successful roll-out of the UK vaccination
programme has led the Directors to feel confident that the considerable restrictions caused by COVID-19
on people’s lifestyles are almost at an end.

As our clubs re-open in spring 2021, the Group is experiencing even stronger demand than in summer 2020
when considerable fears over winter COVID-19 resurgence remained. The Group’s April 2021
membership sales of 36k set a new all-time record, and this was achieved with only English clubs offering a
restricted product range for 19 days in the month.

The Directors are confident strong recent demand for the Group’s offering will continue, aided by a
number of favourable tailwinds:

- More affluent segments were relatively less impacted during the pandemic and increased household
savings rate should support a sustained period of increased leisure spending.

- 28% of DL members are in the vulnerable >50 years old category and most will have been offered the
vaccine by the time their clubs re-open.

- Restrictions on international travel mean it is likely that fewer families will take foreign holidays in
2021, increasing the pull towards the Group’s wider leisure offering including outdoor pools.

- The appeal of the Group’s suburban locations should increase with people spending an increased
proportion of time working from home post-pandemic, due to a structural shift in working habits.

_Cash Flow Forecasts_

In making their assessment of going concern the Directors have considered the forecast cash flows of the
Group and the liquidity available over an eighteen-month period ending October 2022.

The Group’s base case scenario assumes all UK clubs re-open (and remain open) by May 2021 with 50% of
European clubs re-opening in June (and the remainder opening in July) and that both RCFs totalling
£40m, which are currently fully drawn, are renewed in July 2021. Reflecting expected strong demand, our
base case assumes recovery of member count to 617k by September 2021 and that the Group continues to
utilise Government COVID-19 support where it is available and required. The base case also assumes the
repayment of deferred liabilities to landlords, suppliers and other creditors that were accumulated during
the closure period. Under this base case scenario the Group has sufficient cash reserves, with a low point in
January 2022 of c. £22.6m.

_Downside Scenario Testing_

The Directors have considered the impact of downside scenarios. The two scenarios were firstly the loss of
the RCFs, in the event they cannot be renewed in July 2021 and secondly further COVID-19 disruption,
were new variants to escape vaccines causing further national lockdowns, with enforced club closures,
commencing December 2021. Under the first scenario the Group does not have adequate short-term
liquidity to repay both the RCFs, so this scenario, whilst considered unlikely to arise by the Directors,
would cause a liquidity shortfall in July 2021. Under the second scenario, prior to any mitigation, a liquidity
shortfall would arise in January 2022.

In considering the output of downside scenario testing, the Directors have also considered the additional
actions which may be available to mitigate the impact on liquidity. Key mitigating actions, albeit not all
within the Directors’ control, include minimising all capital expenditure, further rent/creditor deferrals,
labour savings through a restructuring programme as well as asset liquidation through selling plant and
equipment, and sale and leasebacks of remaining freehold and long leasehold sites. Liquidity could also be
generated from the issuance of new equity. Learnings gained from club closures, and stakeholder support
received during the pandemic lead the Directors to consider their ability to deliver a level of mitigating
actions which protect liquidity to be very high.

_Conclusion_

The liquidity of the Group has been reduced as a result of many months of club closures. Whilst the
Directors believe the current COVID-19 pandemic is receding, it is too early to definitively conclude
future variants of COVID-19 will not necessitate further lockdowns and club closures which would
adversely impact the future financial performance and cash flows of the Group. Furthermore, there
remains a risk that the Group is unable to extend its RCF facilities, when they fall due for renewal in July
2021. This leads the Directors to conclude that the factors noted in the Downside Scenario Testing section
above constitute a material uncertainty which would cast significant doubt on the Group and the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and therefore, it may be unable to realise its assets and
discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.

Notwithstanding this material uncertainty, having assessed financial forecasts, likely downside scenarios
and possible mitigating actions, the Directors have formed the judgement that the Group and Company
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the next twelve months from the date of
approval of these financial statements. Therefore, the Directors have deemed it appropriate to prepare
these financial statements on the going concern basis.

**Revenue recognition**

Revenue is derived from the provision of sport and leisure facilities in the United Kingdom and Europe.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts
receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and
other sales-related taxes.

The Group’s revenues are recognised mainly from the following goods and services:

- Membership subscriptions;

- Administration and joining fees;

- Sale of sports lessons including swimming, tennis and personal training;

- Other product sales, including food and beverage and cr`eche services.

_Membership subscriptions_

Membership subscriptions can be paid annually or monthly by direct debit. Subscriptions are recognised
over the period of membership, with any subscriptions payments received in advance of the period in which
the service is provided being recorded as a contract liability on the statement of financial position.

During the period clubs were closed, members were put on ‘free freeze’ and therefore not charged a
monthly subscription. For March 2020 members had already paid their monthly direct debit. The clubs
were closed for the last 11 days of March. Consequently, 11 days of the March subscription was recognised
as contract liability. Members were given the option to choose vouchers (food and beverage (F&B),
personal training (PT) or guest passes) to reflect the fact they had not been able to use the club. Revenue
relating to the vouchers is recognised at the earliest of: the guest pass, PT voucher or F&B voucher being
utilised; the voucher expiring or the member leaves David Lloyd as the vouchers are not transferrable. For
November 2020, members had already paid their monthly direct debit. The clubs were closed for 26 days in
November. Consequently, 26 days of the November subscription was recognised as a contract liability. This
member credit was offset against their December monthly direct debit and revenue was recognised during
the period clubs were open.

_Administration and joining fees_

Administration and joining fees are paid upfront and are non-refundable. They represent a fee for the
initial set up costs of the contract and for the right to renew the membership for no additional fee when the
contract expires. Revenue is recognised in line with when the performance obligations are performed

F-42

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

which is over the average membership period, including any period of renewal. Revenue relating to future
periods of membership are recognised as contract liabilities in the statement of financial position.

The average membership periods over which revenue is recognised are:

Standard membership 24 months
Flexible membership 1 month
Annual membership 24 months

_Product sales_

Revenue from food and beverage sales, and other merchandise is recognised at the point of sale.

_Other revenue_

Other revenue comprises income from personal training, tennis and swimming classes. Revenue is
recognised over the period that classes are provided, and any upfront payment is recognised as a contract
liability on the statement of financial position.

Sports lessons are paid for upfront at the beginning of the term or monthly by direct debit. Cash received is
recognised over the period that lessons are provided, and any upfront payment is recognised as a contract
liability on the statement of financial position.

Personal training is paid for monthly by direct debit, through the purchase of vouchers online or in club.
Sessions can be purchased in packs of one, four or eight. Revenue is recognised as and when personal
training sessions are delivered (or vouchers have expired). Vouchers normally have an expiry date of
between one and three months depending on quantity purchased, from the date of purchase. Cash received
in relation to future periods is recognised as a contract liability on the statement of financial position.

**Other income / Government grants**

Government grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with
the conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received.

Government grants are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the
Group recognises expenses related to the costs for which the grants are intended to compensate.

Government grants that are receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the
purpose of giving immediate financial support to the Group with no future related costs are recognised in
profit or loss in the period in which they become receivable.

Money received under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, or equivalent schemes across Europe, is
recorded within other income in the period in which the related expense is incurred.

**Exceptional items**

Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements, where it is necessary to provide
further understanding of the financial performance of the Group. They are items that are material, either
because of their size or their nature, or that are non-recurring.

**Foreign currency transactions and balances**

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency
of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘‘the functional currency’’). The
consolidated financial statements are presented in pound sterling, which is also the Group’s functional
currency.

Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are recognised at the rates of exchange
prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each statement of financial position date, monetary assets

F-43


-----

**Deuce Holdco Limited**

**Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year ended 31 December 2020 (Continued)**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that
date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at
the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured
in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Exchange differences are recognised
in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.

On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated into pounds sterling at rates
approximating to those ruling when the transactions took place. All assets and liabilities of overseas
operations, including goodwill arising on the acquisition of those operations, are translated at the rate
ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on translating the opening net assets at the
opening rate and the results of overseas operations at the actual rate are recognised in other
comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign exchange reserve.

The average conversion rate during the period was £1: A1.10 (2019: £1: A1.14), and at the statement of
financial position date was £1: A1.11 (2019: £1: A1.18).

**Borrowings**

Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are
subsequently measured at amortised cost. Borrowings are classified as loans within non-current, current
liabilities based on their maturity date.

**Borrowing costs**

Costs directly attributable to the refinancing have been capitalised and amortised over the related loan
period. Where fees do not relate directly to a particular loan, they have been apportioned between the
loans based on the total loan principal.

**Tax**

The tax expense for the period comprises current tax and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income
statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or
directly in equity respectively.

The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the
balance sheet date in the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable
income.

Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities
and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are
not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is not accounted for if it
arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that
at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is
determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of
financial position date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the
deferred tax liability is settled.

Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be
available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and
when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on
either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities and there is an intention to settle the balances on
a net basis.

**Investments**

Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are held at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

F-44

**Deuce Holdco Limited**

**Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year ended 31 December 2020 (Continued)**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**Property, plant and equipment**

Land and buildings held for use in the supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, are
stated in the statement of financial position at their net book value, being the fair value at the date of
acquisition less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.

Plant and machinery are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised
impairment loss. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the
item.

**Depreciation**

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over
their useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:

Fixtures and Fittings—between 3 and 23 years
Freehold Buildings—50 years
Freehold land is not depreciated.

The gain or loss arising on the disposal or scrappage of an asset is determined as the difference between
the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit/(loss) on disposal of
PP&E within the income statement.

**Club opening costs**

Site development costs capitalised represent costs incurred in respect of the development of new sites. No
depreciation is charged until the new club is brought into operation.

Costs incurred prior to the date of opening a club which are not directly associated with its acquisition,
construction, refurbishment or fitting out are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.

**Goodwill**

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method or using merger accounting where it
was a common control transaction and the relative rights remained the same before and after the
combination. Under the acquisition method, the cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the
consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling
interest in the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in exceptional
operating expenses.

When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate
classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and
pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.

Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred
over the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in
excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the gain is recognised in profit or loss. Goodwill is
capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated
statement of comprehensive income.

After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the
purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date,
allocated to groups of cash-generating units (‘‘CGU’’) that are expected to benefit from the combination,
irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. Goodwill
arising on the acquisition by TDR on 1 November 2013 is monitored internally by management at the
Group level. The Group is considered to be the smallest relevant group of CGUs for goodwill impairment.
Goodwill has also been recognised in relation to individual club acquisitions. For these acquisitions the
relevant club is considered to be the CGU.

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**Intangible assets**

Intangible assets are recognised on business combinations if they are separable from the acquired entity or
give rise to other contractual/legal rights. The amounts ascribed to such intangibles are arrived at by using
appropriate valuation techniques. They are amortised over their useful lives from the date of acquisition.

The fair value of clubs held under operating leasehold interest at acquisition are carried as intangible
assets. Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease
terms.

The estimated value of brand names acquired are recorded as intangible fixed assets with indefinite useful
lives and are therefore tested annually for impairment.

An identifiable internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s Information Technology
development is recognised only to the extent its cost can be reliably measured and future economic
benefits will flow to the Group as a result.

Internally-generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives—usually
3 years.

Computer software and licenses are capitalised at cost, and amortised over their useful life or licence
period, where applicable—18 months to 3 years.

**Impairment of tangible and intangible assets**

At each statement of financial position date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and
intangible assets (including goodwill) to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have
suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated
to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that
are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating
unit (‘‘CGU’’) to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for
impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.

Each individual club is considered to be a CGU.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use,
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which
the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the
carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is
recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is increased
to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for
the asset (or CGU) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or
loss.

Investments are reviewed for impairment based upon their recoverable amount.

**Inventories**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and,
where applicable, overheads that have been incurred in bringing the stocks to their present location and
condition. Cost is calculated using the weighted average method. Net realisable value represents the
estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling
and distribution.

**Deuce Holdco Limited**

**Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year ended 31 December 2020 (Continued)**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly
liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts. Restricted cash
relates to cash held at bank which is not immediately available for use in the ordinary course of business.

**Creditors**

Creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Creditors are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.

**Trade and other receivables**

Trade and other receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the
ordinary course of business. Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that
is unconditional, unless they contain significant financing components, when they are recognized at fair
value. The Group holds the trade receivables with the objective of collecting the contractual cash flows and
therefore measures them subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a
lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables.

**Provisions**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a
past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate
can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the
present obligation at the statement of financial position date, taking into account the risks and
uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to
settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows. The amortisation
of the discount is recognised as interest expense.

**Employee benefits**

_Pension obligations_

The Group operates various defined contribution pension plans. The Group pays contributions to privately
administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contracted or voluntary basis. The Group has no
further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an
employee benefit expense. The assets of the scheme are invested and managed independently of the
finances of the Group.

_Senior management incentive plan_

The Group recognises a liability and an expense for participants of the Senior Management Incentive Plan
which is payable upon sale of the business if certain conditions are met by amortising the present value of
the estimated payment over the expected service period. This liability is recorded within provisions.

_Share-based payments_

Employees (including senior executives) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based
payments, whereby employees render services as consideration for the right to purchase equity instruments
in the parent company (equity-settled transactions).

F-47


-----

**Deuce Holdco Limited**

**Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year ended 31 December 2020 (Continued)**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for equity-settled transactions for
which vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition. These are treated as vesting
irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other
performance and/or service conditions are satisfied.

The fair value at start date of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding
increase in the share-based payment reserve in equity, over the period in which the performance and/or
service conditions are fulfilled. The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each
reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the
Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The income statement
expense or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the
beginning and end of that period and is recognised in employee benefits expense.

When the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense
had the terms not been modified, if the original terms of the award are met. An additional expense is
recognised for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction,
or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.

When an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any
expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. This includes any award where
non-vesting conditions within the control of either the entity or the employee are not met. However, if a
new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that
it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award,
as described in the previous paragraph.

**Employee Benefit Trust**

The Employee Benefit Trust is considered to be controlled by the Group. The activities of the Trust are
conducted on behalf of the Group according to its specific business needs in order to obtain benefits from
its operation and on this basis, the assets held by the Trust are consolidated into the Group’s financial
statements.

**Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity.

**Financial liabilities**

_Classification_

Financial liabilities can be classified as ‘fair value through profit or loss’ or held at amortised cost. All are
initially recognised at fair value, and in the case of loans, net of any transaction costs. Loans are measured
at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method, with interest expense recognised on an effective
yield basis.

_Recognition and measurement_

The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged,
cancelled or they expire.

**Financial assets**

_Classification_

The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories: financial assets at fair
value (either through Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) or through profit or loss) and financial assets at
amortised cost.

F-48


-----

**Deuce Holdco Limited**

**Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year ended 31 December 2020 (Continued)**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time
of initial recognition. For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will be recorded either in profit or
loss or in OCI.

_Recognition and measurement_

All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of a
financial asset is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the time frame
established by the market concerned.

At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial
asset measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, transaction costs that are directly attributable
to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through
profit or loss (FVTPL) are expensed in profit or loss.

Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether
their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest.

_Impairment_

The Group assesses, on a forward-looking basis, the expected credit losses associated with its debt
instruments carried at amortised cost and fair value through profit or loss. Expected credit losses are
measured through a loss allowance at an amount equal to the expected credit losses for the next 12 months
or the expected credit losses over the lifetime of the asset. The impairment methodology applied depends
on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.

For trade receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires
expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.

_Derecognition of financial assets_

The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset
expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of
the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards
of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in
the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all
the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the
financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.

**Leases**

The Group leases various clubs and equipment. Rental contracts are typically made for fixed periods of
12 months to 125 years but may have extension options.

Contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Group allocates the consideration in the
contract to the lease and non-lease components based on their relative stand-alone prices. However, for
leases of real estate for which the company is a lessee and for which it has major leases, it has elected not
to separate lease and non-lease components and instead accounts for these as a single lease component.

Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and
conditions. The lease agreements do not impose any covenants other than the security interests in the
leased assets that are held by the lessor. Leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes.

The Group has entered into commercial property leases and other plant and equipment as a lessee. The
leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset with a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased
asset is available for use by the Group.

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities
include the net present value of the following lease payments:

- Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;

- Variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate
as at the commencement date;

- Amounts expected to be payable by the company under residual value guarantees;

- The exercise price of a purchase option if the company is reasonably certain to exercise that option;
and

- Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the company exercising that
option.

Lease payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options are also included in the
measurement of the liability. The lease payments are discounted using the incremental borrowing rate
(‘‘IBR’’). This is the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow, over a similar term and with
security funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the cost of the right-of-use asset in a similar
economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions.

The Group is exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments based on an index or rate,
which are not included in the lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments to lease payments
based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability is reassessed and adjusted against the right-of-use
asset.

Lease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or
loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of
the liability for each period. Where lease payments have been deferred as a direct consequence of
COVID-19, no allocation is made against the lease liability during the deferral period. Invoices received in
relation to deferred rents are recognised as trade payables, with a corresponding deferred rent prepayment
recognised in the statement of financial position.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:

- The amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability;

- Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;

- Any initial direct costs; and

- Restoration costs.

Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term
on a straight-line basis. If the company is reasonably certain to exercise a purchase option, the right-of-use
asset is depreciated over the underlying asset’s useful life.

Lease income from operating leases where the Group is a lessor is recognised in income on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. Initial direct costs incurred in obtaining an operating lease are added to the
carrying amount of the underlying asset and recognised as an expense over the lease term on the same
basis as lease income. The respective leased assets are included in the balance sheet based on their nature.

Information about critical accounting estimates and judgements in the application of lease accounting is
disclosed in note 3.

_Impact of the initial application of ‘COVID-Related Rent Concessions’ Amendment to IFRS 16_

In May 2020, the IASB issued COVID-Related Rent Concessions (Amendment to IFRS 16) that provides
practical relief to lessees in accounting for rent concessions occurring as a direct consequence of
COVID-19, by introducing a practical expedient to IFRS 16. The practical expedient permits a lessee to
elect not to assess whether a COVID-related rent concession is a lease modification. A lessee that makes
this election shall account for any change in lease payments resulting from the COVID-related rent
concession the same way it would account for the change applying IFRS 16 if the change were not a lease
modification.

The practical expedient applies only to rent concessions occurring as a direct consequence of COVID-19
and only if all of the following conditions are met:

(a) The change in lease payments results in revised consideration for the lease that is substantially the
same as, or less than, the consideration for the lease immediately preceding the change;

(b) Any reduction in lease payments affects only payments originally due on or before 30 June 2021 (a
rent concession meets this condition if it results in reduced lease payments on or before 30 June 2021
and increased lease payments that extend beyond 30 June 2021); and

(c) There is no substantive change to other terms and conditions of the lease. In the current financial
year, the Group has applied the amendment to IFRS 16 (as issued by the IASB in May 2020) in
advance of its effective date.

The impact of applying this practical expedient during the year was to increase the lease liability by £17.3m
for rents that have been deferred.

There are no other amendments to accounting standards, or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for
the year ended 31 December 2020 that have had a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.
For completeness the following new standards, amendments and interpretations are newly mandatorily
effective for the first time in the current period:

- Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions (Amendment to IFRS16);

- Amendments to IFRS 4, Applying IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ with IFRS 4 ‘Insurance Contracts’;

- Amendments to IFRS 3, Definition of a Business;

- Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8, Definition of Material;

- Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7, Interest Rate Benchmark Reform;

- Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards

(b) New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted

At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the Group has not applied the following new and
revised IFRS Standards that have been issued but are not yet effective:

- IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts;

- Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28, Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its
Associate or Joint Venture

- Amendments to IAS 1, Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current

- Amendments to IFRS 3, Reference to the Conceptual Framework;

- Amendments to IAS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment—Proceeds before Intended Use

- Amendments to IAS 37, Onerous Contracts—Cost of Fulfilling a Contract

- Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020 Cycle

None of these are expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group or the
Company.

**Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year ended 31 December 2020 (Continued)**

**3 Critical accounting estimates and judgements**

Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

**Critical accounting estimates and assumptions**

The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The related accounting estimates will,
by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the
next financial year are addressed below:

_Lease accounting_

The lease payments are discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate (‘‘IBR’’), being the rate
that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar
value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and
conditions.

To determine the IBR, the Group has considered three main risk premiums (adjustments) being: reference
rate, credit risk premium and asset specific adjustment.

Reference rate (risk free rate)—In assessing the relevant reference rate, we have taken into account
currency, economic environment and unexpired terms of the leases. Relevant government bond yields have
been used as a proxy for the risk free rate.

Credit risk premium—The Group have estimated an additional credit risk to reflect the difference in risk
profile between a Government bond and another debt security with the same maturity.

Asset (lease) specific adjustment—The Group have used property yields as a proxy to differentiate
between different property types and locations. The asset specific adjustment has been based on property
initial yield benchmarks taking into account the expected annual rental growth rate and the expected
annual building depreciation rate.

The key factors influencing the discount rate are:

- Economic environment/country;

- Length of Lease;

- Lessee entity;

- Type of collateral;

- Rent review mechanism in the lease i.e. contingent market rent reviews versus fixed increases or
indexation.

The Group developed a categorisation of leases and a matrix of discount rates at transition to reflect the
specific factors above. During the year, a number of the Group’s leases were re-negotiated and have been
treated as lease modifications under IFRS16. A revised discount rate at the effective date of the
modification has been used to re-measure the lease liabilities, with a corresponding adjustment to the
right-of use-asset. The calculated IBR at 31 December 2020 range between 2.8%–9.24% (2019: 2.8%–9%)
translating to an average rate of 7.1% (2019: 6.8%). A 4-basis point increase/(decrease) in the rate would
cause the lease liabilities to increase/(decrease) by £5.0m (2019: 5-basis point increase/(decrease) £6.1m)
and a corresponding increase/(decrease) in the right-of-use assets of £5.1m (2019: 5-basis point increase/
(decrease) £6.5m). The IBR can change due to the type of leases that are held by the Group, the economic
environment, the lease terms and asset types.

_Key assumptions used for assessing goodwill for impairment_

Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis. Goodwill arising on the acquisition by TDR on
1 November 2013 is tested at the Group level. The Group is considered to be the smallest relevant group

F-52

**Deuce Holdco Limited**

**Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year ended 31 December 2020 (Continued)**

**3 Critical accounting estimates and judgements (Continued)**

of CGUs for goodwill impairment testing, as this is the level at which goodwill is monitored internally.
Goodwill has also been recognised in relation to individual club acquisitions. For these acquisitions the
relevant club is considered to be the CGU for goodwill impairment testing. The Group has determined the
recoverable amount by estimating the value in use of the cash-generating units within the Group. The
calculation of value in use requires estimation of future cashflows and a discount rate to determine the
present value. Sensitivity to changes in this assumption are disclosed in note 15.

_Key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations_

The Group tests the carrying amounts of individual club non-current assets for impairment for those clubs
that meet pre-defined impairment indicators. For the 2020 and 2019 reporting periods, the recoverable
amount of the cash-generating units (CGUs) was determined based on value-in-use calculations which
require the use of assumptions. The calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets and
business plans approved by management covering a three-year period. Cash flows beyond the three-year
period are extrapolated using an estimated growth rate of 1.8% for the UK and Holland, 1.7% for Spain
and 1.4% for France and Belgium. These growth rates are consistent with forecasts specific to the industry
and the country in which each CGU operates. The pre-tax discount rates of 10.5% for the UK, and 11.5%
for Spain have been determined based on the weighted average cost of capital. Sensitivity to changes in
assumptions are disclosed within note 15.

_Option valuation_

On 30 January 2020, Deuce Topco Limited (the Company’s immediate parent) granted DLL (a subsidiary
of the Company) an option to acquire the entire issued share capital of DLL Greenwich Limited. The
option is exercisable at any point from 30 January 2020 to 30 January 2023. The fair value of the call option
is derived using option valuation techniques, with key inputs being the market value of DLL Greenwich,
the cost to exercise the option and other key factors such as market volatility. The key driver of the fair
value of the option is the equity value of DLL Greenwich Ltd which as an unlisted entity requires
significant management judgement to determine. Using the purchase price of the Meridian Group and the
year-end enterprise value of the business we have concluded the value of the option is £nil.

**Critical judgements in applying the entity’s accounting policies**

_Lease accounting_

In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic
incentive to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option. Periods covered by an
option to extend the lease term are included in the lease term if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise
that option. The same rationale applies to termination options.

Significant judgement is involved in determining the period over which a lease is considered to be
‘enforceable’. Where contracts have a term of greater than 10 years remaining at transition, the Group
assesses there to be an unclear indication that it would in substance be deemed to be ‘enforceable’ beyond
the original contractual term, despite the rights provided by The Landlord and Tenant Act 1954. The lease
end date has therefore been used as the end date for the lease. For leases due to expire within 10 years of
transition, the likelihood of extension is being assessed up to the year end with reference to the facts
available and looking at the Group’s history of renewing leases beyond the contractual end date.

For the current leases held by the Group, we currently conclude the minimum lease term to be the term of
the lease contract, including any reversionary leases. We assess, based on our current plans or expectations,
the situation for each lease for which options to extend, terminate or purchase exist annually and
judgement will be applied in the weighting of relevant factors in each case.

**3 Critical accounting estimates and judgements (Continued)**

_Judgements in determining the timing of satisfaction of performance obligations under IFRS15_

The timing of satisfaction of performance obligations of administration and joining fees for members
requires judgment. Administration and joining fees represent a fee for the initial set-up costs of the
contract and for the right to renew the membership for no additional fee when the contract expires. The
set-up costs are critical to the contract with the new member, but they do not satisfy performance
obligations, as no good or service is transferred to the member. The member effectively pays for the future
right of renewing their membership for no additional fee. It is at these renewal dates that the performance
obligation is fulfilled, therefore it is appropriate to recognise the revenue over the total membership
period, which includes any renewal period. Historical data and trends have been used to determine the
average period of membership and number of renewals for each package type.

COVID-19 resulted in club closures. During this period, no revenue was recognised as performance
obligations had not been satisfied.

In making their judgement, the directors have considered the detailed criteria for the recognition of
revenue set out in IFRS 15. Following the detailed review of the Group’s membership base and historic
trends, the directors are satisfied that the recognition of revenue in the current year is appropriate.

_Control_

On 30 January 2020, DLL Greenwich GmbH, an entity outside the Group, but related by virtue of a
common ultimate controlling party, purchased the entire issued share capital of Meridian Spa & Fitness
Deutschland GmbH and its subsidiaries (known as the ‘‘Meridian Group’’) which consists of eight health
and spa clubs from leasehold premises in Germany. On the same date, Deuce Topco Limited (the
Company’s immediate parent) and DLL Greenwich GmbH entered into an agreement with David Lloyd
Leisure Limited (‘‘DLL’’) whereby DLL will provide certain management and operation services and to
license the Trade Marks to the Meridian Group. In consideration for the provision of these services, Deuce
Topco Limited (the Company’s parent) granted DLL (a subsidiary of the Company) an option to acquire
the entire issued share capital of DLL Greenwich Limited, which is the parent undertaking of DLL
Greenwich GmbH. The option is exercisable at any point from 30 January 2020 to 30 January 2023.

This option requires management to determine whether the Meridian Group should be considered within
these financial statements due to the rights bestowed to the Group by this option. In order to exercise the
option, DLL would need to obtain consent from its banking group. Given this requirement and the
economic and restrictive barriers in place, the Directors have concluded that the Group does not have
control over DLL Greenwich Limited until the option is exercised and has therefore not consolidated DLL
Greenwich Limited as at 31 December 2020.

**4 Prior year adjustment**

During the year, the directors identified that the Group had understated both deferred tax asset balances
and reserves at 31 December 2019 by £21m. As a result, a prior year adjustment has been made and is
reflected in the restated 2019 balances as presented.

The Group adopted IFRS 16 Leases retrospectively from 1 January 2019 but did not restate comparatives
for the 2018 reporting period, as permitted under the specific transition provisions in the standard. The
adjustments arising from the new leasing rules were therefore recognised in the opening balance sheet on
1 January 2019. There were no errors related to the adoption of IFRS 16 itself. The error was restricted to
the deferred tax calculation. The misstatement of the deferred tax balances related to the complexities of
the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases retrospectively from 1 January 2019.

There is no impact on the prior year income statement and the effect of the prior year adjustment is to
increase the opening 1 January 2019 deferred tax asset by £21m and to reduce accumulated losses at
1 January 2019 by £21m. This is the adjustment that should have been recorded in the prior year financial
statements should the error never have arisen in the first place.

UK Corporation tax is calculated at 19% (2019: 19%) of the estimated taxable profit for the year. Taxation
for other corporation jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.

After the balance sheet date, the UK Government have subsequently announced in the 2021 Budget that
the corporation tax rate will increase to 25% in 2023 (the impact of this is disclosed in note 27).

The tax credit for the year is higher (2019: higher) than the standard rate of corporation tax. The
differences are explained below:

The adjustment in respect of prior periods of £4.6m credit (2019: £1.7m credit) primarily relates to the
analysis of the tax treatment of exceptional items and fixed assets where further information is
subsequently available on the nature of these costs.

**15 Impairment testing**

Goodwill and brands with indefinite lives are subject to an annual impairment test. Goodwill and brands
are allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to
those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the
business combination in which the goodwill arose. The units or groups of units are identified at the lowest
level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, being the Group for goodwill
arising on the acquisition of the Group by TDR on 1 November 2013 and individual clubs for goodwill
arising on acquisitions of individual clubs. Club impairments of tangible fixed assets are charged to
individual clubs as these are considered to be separate cash generating units (CGUs) at which the Group
monitors performance.

**15 Impairment testing (Continued)**

The COVID-19 lockdowns during 2020 caused a significant decline in revenue and increase in operating
losses, together with a reduction in future forecast profitability resulting in impairment charges of £28.8m.
£7.1m of the impairment charge was recognised in relation to the Bad Homburg club, located in Germany,
of which £4.2m relates to PPE, £2.4m relates to ROU Assets and £0.5m related to fair value uplifts.

**Key assumptions used in value in use calculations**

The recoverable amount of tangible fixed assets is determined based on a value in use calculation using
cash flow projections from financial budgets approved by senior management. The pre-tax discount rate
applied to cash flow projections is 10.5% for UK and other European countries and 11.5% for Spain (2019:
10.5% for UK and other European countries and 10.4% for Spain) and cash flows beyond the five-year
period are extrapolated using a 1.8% for the UK and Holland, 1.7% for Spain and 1.4% for France and
Belgium (2019: 1.9%).

Discount rate—The discount rate was determined using current market assessments of the time value of
money and the risks specific to the asset.

**Sensitivity to changes in assumptions for goodwill**

Any change to the above key assumptions could have a material impact on the recoverable amount; which
is then compared to the carrying value of the cash generating unit to determine if there is an impairment.
The Group has determined the recoverable amount by estimating the value in use of the cash-generating
units within the Group. The calculation of value in use requires estimation of future cashflows and a
discount rate to determine the present value. The sensitivity of goodwill impairment to changes in the
discount rate are shown below:

**Impact of** **Adjusted**
**Impairment** **change** **impairment**
**£ 000** **£ 000** **£ 000**

Discount rate increase of 3.3% . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . — (6,493) (6,493)

**Sensitivity to changes in assumptions for tangible fixed assets**

With regard to the assessment of value in use, a change in any of the above key assumptions could have a
material impact on the carrying value of the cash generating unit. Clubs have been assessed for impairment
at the year end by comparing the carrying value of tangible fixed assets for each CGU against its value in
use. The sensitivity of the club impairments to changes in the discount rate and long-term growth rates is
shown below:

For the purposes of property, plant and equipment impairment reviews, the Group considers each club to
be an individual cash-generating unit (CGU), with each CGU reviewed annually for indicators of
impairment. The Group compared the carrying value of property, plant and equipment to the estimated
value in use. This was calculated based on projected cash flows to 2025, using a discount factor of 10.5% of
UK and other European countries (2019:10.5%) and 11.5% for Spain (2019: 10.4%). This has resulted in a
total impairment charge of £9.1m (2019: £7.9m), of which £4.2m was in relation to the club in Bad
Homburg, Germany.

As a direct result of COVID-19, the Group has renegotiated a number of its leases of land and buildings in
the year. The Group has remeasured the lease liability with the revised lease payments and lease term,
using a revised discount rate at the effective date of the lease modification. This has resulted in an increase
in the lease liability of £45.7m, with a corresponding adjustment to the right of use asset. The Group also
entered into a sale and leaseback transaction over the land and buildings at Bristol Emersons Green. This
transaction resulted in the recognition of a £5.6m of right-of-use asset and £11.7m lease liability. Other
additions in the year relate to remeasurements as a result of rent reviews in the year.

Goodwill and brands are not amortised but tested annually for impairment. The brand is considered to
have an indefinite life due to the history and market position of the trade name. The Group recognised an
impairment charge of £0.3m against goodwill. The impairment was in relation to goodwill that arose on the
2018 acquisitions of Geneva and Bad Homburg.

**24 Financial risk management and impairment of financial assets**

**Group**

In common with all other businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial
instruments. This note describes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks
and the methods used to measure them. Further quantitative information in respect of these risks is
presented throughout these financial statements.

The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group’s risk management objectives and
policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing
and operating processes that ensure the effective implementation of the objectives and policies to the
Group’s finance function. The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far
as possible without unduly affecting the Group’s competitiveness and flexibility. Further details regarding
these policies are set out below:

**Credit risk and impairment**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument
fails to meet its contractual obligations. The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade
receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of impairment of doubtful receivables,
which is made where there is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows. The credit risk
of the Group is minimised as customers pay by direct debit in advance. Credit risk also arises from cash
and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions. For banks and financial
institutions, only independently rated parties with minimum rating ‘‘A’’ are accepted. Further disclosures
regarding trade and other receivables, which are neither past due nor impaired, are provided in note 20.

**Commodity price risk**

The Group manages its exposure to electricity and gas price risk by purchasing its utility requirements in
advance through industry leading advisers. For 2021, 75% of the UK electricity volumes and 63% of the
UK gas volumes have been purchased. Unused utility volumes are sold back to the market with the Group
liable for any losses due to lower pricing.

**Capital risk**

Capital risk arises from the management of the capital structure, which consists mainly of the loans and
borrowings detailed in note 23 and shareholder equity. The capital structure should be managed to ensure
the Group can remain a going concern, and to maximise shareholder funds. Detailed cash flow forecasts

**24 Financial risk management and impairment of financial assets (Continued)**

based on expected working capital requirements and expected capital projects are maintained throughout
the year to ensure that the Group has sufficient funds to operate as a going concern using the available
facilities.

**Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital, loan facilities and the finance
charges on its debt instruments. To ensure that the Group always has sufficient cash to meet its liabilities, it
seeks to maintain cash balances (or agreed facilities) to meet expected requirements according to
predicted cash flows.

**Maturity analysis**

The following table sets out the contractual undiscounted maturities including cashflows of the financial
liabilities of the Group as at 31 December 2020:

Trade and other payables includes trade payables, social security and other taxes, and other payables as
disclosed in note 22.

**Interest rate risk**

The Group’s sensitivity to change in the interest rate is limited as the loan notes have a fixed interest rate
of 10%.The Revolving Credit Facilities are fully drawn with interest at a variable rate related to LIBOR.
The Group monitors interest rates and reacts accordingly.

**Foreign exchange risk**

Foreign exchange risk arises when individual Group entities enter into transactions denominated in a
currency other than their functional currency. The Group’s policy is, where possible, to allow Group
entities to settle liabilities denominated in their functional currency with the cash generated from their own
operations in that currency. Where Group entities have liabilities denominated in a currency other than
their functional currency (and have insufficient reserves of that currency to settle them), cash already
denominated in that currency will, where possible, be transferred from elsewhere within the Group.

**Principal financial instruments**

- Trade receivables;

- Fixed rate loans;

- Cash and cash equivalents;

- Lease liabilities;

- Trade and other payables.

**Financial instruments not measured at fair value**

Financial instruments not measured at fair value includes all of the above.

Due to their short-term nature, the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other
receivables, trade and other payables and lease liabilities approximates their fair value.

**Fair value measurement**

Any fair value measurement is categorised within the fair value hierarchy:

- Level 1—Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

- Level 2—Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement is directly or indirectly observable; and

- Level 3—Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement is unobservable.

The fair value of the bank borrowings as disclosed in Note 23 was measured using Level 2 techniques. It is
based on national lending rates on similar loans from information released by the Bank of England.

Where the fair valuations are on a recurring basis the Group determines whether transfers have occurred
between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is
significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

There have not been any transfers between levels in the hierarchy for any financial instruments.

**25 Share-based payments**

**Scheme details and movements**

Under the Management Incentive Plan (‘‘MIP’’) senior executives of the Group are entitled to purchase B,
C, D and E ordinary shares. The B, C, D and E ordinary shareholders are entitled to participate in
proceeds on a sale of the Group in accordance with the Articles of the Company. Members of the plan
must remain employees of the Group in order to retain their full entitlement to participate in proceeds.
There are no other vesting conditions. The intrinsic value (being the difference between the cash paid and

the fair value) at the date of grant is recognised as an equity-settled share-based payment and spread on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period.

On 17 March 2020, the Company bought back and cancelled 24,550 E shares from leavers with a nominal
value of £1 each, for consideration of £0.3m. The consideration was equal to the outstanding balance of the
limited recourse loan used to fund the purchase of these shares, plus accrued interest. The cancellation of
shares has been recognised as a credit to the capital redemption reserve. The limited recourse loan was
written off to distributable reserves at the date the shares were issued, therefore no further entries have
been made during the year for the consideration.

The expense recognised in employee expenses during the year is £0.9m (2019: £4.1m). This has decreased
on prior year due to the assumptions around the potential timing of exit being extended further into the
future.

a) Senior Management Incentive Plan

The Senior Management Incentive Plan ‘‘SMIP’’ is an incentive plan for senior managers. Participants do
not receive equity shares but rather an invitation to share in a bonus pool upon exit. The bonus on exit is
calculated on the same basis as the amount receivable in respect of an E share, except it will be paid net of
employment taxes.

b) Other provisions

Other provisions relate to a retention guarantee that has been withheld by the Group in relation to the
Aravaca land purchase, and estimated dilapidation costs for the Solihull, Maidenhead and Maidstone
clubs. The dilapidation provision for Kingston was released during the year due to the lease being
extended.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so. The
following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances (after offset) for financial reporting purposes. These
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not offset because these balances do not unwind on the same basis.

The comparative information has been restated as a result of the prior year adjustments as discussed in
note 4.

In addition to the recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities above, the Group has unrecognised
deferred tax assets of £2.8m (2019: £2.7m) in respect of the UK property portfolio, and unrecognised
deferred tax assets of £16.0m (2019: £3.8m) in relation to carried forward losses where it is not sufficiently
probable they will be utilised against future profits.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been recognised at the main rate of corporation tax in the relevant
jurisdiction prevailing at the expected date of unwind with reference to enacted rates on the balance sheet
date. In the UK the long term corporation tax rate of 19% enacted as at 31 December 2020 is used. The
opening balances in the UK used the corporation tax rate enacted at 1 January 2020 of 17%. Thus, of the
total movement in year, a charge of £7.6m relates to the increase in rate. In The Netherlands the long term
corporation tax rate of 25% enacted as at 31 December 2020 is used. The opening balances in The
Netherlands used the corporation tax rate enacted at 1 January 2020 of 21.3%. Thus, of the total
movement in year, a credit of £1.7m relates to the increase in rate.

The UK government has subsequently announced in the 2021 Budget that the corporation tax rate will rise
to 25% in 2023. This revised rate would increase the deferred tax liabilities by £56.8m and the deferred tax
assets by £42.6m resulting in a net increase in the balance sheet liabilities of £14.2m.

**Capital commitments**

At the statement of financial position date, the Group had committed to purchasing land for a new site in
Bicester. The total amount contracted for but not provided in the financial statements was £2.2m (2019:
£3.6m).

**30 Post balance sheet events**

On 4 January 2021, England entered a third national lockdown with all UK clubs closed. Most European
countries in which we operate were also under national lockdowns meaning many of our European clubs
were closed.

On 22 February 2021, the UK Government announced the government’s four-step roadmap to cautiously
ease lockdown restrictions in England if there is continued progress with the Government’s four test
criteria. Under Step 1 of the roadmap, we opened our outdoor facilities (tennis, group exercise and
swimming) across the vast majority of our English clubs from the 29 March 2021.

Our English clubs re-opened on 12 April 2021 under Step 2 of the English government’s four step roadmap
with indoor group exercise planned to restart on 17 May 2021 under Step 3. Our Scottish clubs re-opened
on 26 April 2021 and our Welsh clubs re-opened on 3 May 2021.

In the Government’s Budget statement of 3 March 2021, it was announced that Business Rates relief for
Retail, Hospitality & Leisure extended until 30 June 2021 and then up to [2]⁄3 discount until 31 March 2022
(up to a maximum of £2 million). The announcement also included the extension of the Coronavirus Job
Retention Scheme in its current form to 30 September 2021, with employers contributing 10% of reference
pay from July and 20% of reference pay from August.

Subsequent to the year end, on 13 April 2021 the conditions on the restricted cash have been eased. In
addition, the interest payment due in April 2021 of £12.7m was capitalised and added to the loan principal.

In March 2021, the UK Government announced an increase in the corporation tax rate from 19% to 25%
from April 2023. The increased rate has not been substantively enacted as at the date the accounts have
been signed. The impact of the increased rate would be to increase deferred tax assets by £42.6m and
increase deferred tax liabilities by £56.8m, resulting in a net increase in the balance sheet liabilities of
£8.3m.

**31 Contingent liabilities**

Occasionally, the Group is subject to legal proceedings and claims. A liability is recorded only when it is
probable that the case will result in a future economic outflow which can be reliably measured. In the
Directors’ opinion, after taking appropriate legal advice it is not considered probable that a material
outflow of economic benefits will occur in relation to any ongoing claims.

**Deuce Holdco Limited**

**Independent Auditor’s Report to the members of Deuce Holdco Limited**

Report on the audit of the financial statements

**1.** **Opinion**

In our opinion:

- the financial statements of Deuce Holdco Limited (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the
‘group’) give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at
31 December 2019 and of the group’s loss for the year then ended;

- the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union

- the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, including Financial Reporting Standard 101
‘‘Reduced Disclosure Framework; and

- the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements which comprise:

- the consolidated income statement;

- the consolidated statement of comprehensive income;

- the consolidated and parent company statements of financial position;

- the consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity;

- the consolidated statement of cash flows; and

- the related notes 1 to 33.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial
statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting
framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 ‘‘Reduced Disclosure
Framework’’.

**2.** **Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and
applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor’s
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.

We are independent of the group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that
are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council’s
(the ‘FRC’s’) Ethical Standard and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with
these requirements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion.

**3.** **Material uncertainty relating to going concern**

We draw attention to note 2 in the financial statements, which indicates that the impact of COVID-19 has
created an unprecedented trading environment. There is uncertainty regarding the potential future impact
of COVID-19 that could lead to further periods of club closure on a local or even national basis, or impact
on member behaviour, resulting in revenue and EBITDA reductions. Furthermore, some of the mitigating
actions identified by management could also be impacted by the uncertain trading environment caused by
COVID-19.

At the date of signing the financial statements, the Group has the following fully drawn finance facilities
available;

F-79


-----

- £947m loan—repayable December 2024; and

- £40m RCF facilities—repayable July 2021.

There are no covenants attached to any of these facilities, as such the risk identified when determining the
appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting to be used in preparation of the financial
statements is specifically whether the Group has sufficient liquidity to pay creditors as they fall due for the
12 months from the date of signing the financial statements. The RCF facilities are repayable in July 2021
and in the event they are not renewed the Group would face a liquidity shortfall in July 2021.

In response, we:

- Obtained an understanding of the relevant controls that are in place in order to allow management to
determine the appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting made;

- Involved our internal data modelling specialists to review the mechanics of the base case model;

- Reviewed the base case model prepared by management and assessed the appropriateness of the key
assumptions made in the model—including the key assumptions as set out on page 49;

- Assessed the appropriateness of the relevant sensitivities and mitigating actions that management
have identified and their impact on the base case model—including assessment of whether any further
sensitivities should applied and for the identified mitigating actions, the likelihood of them being
achieved and if within management’s control; and

- Reviewed the disclosures included in the financial statements to assess that they appropriately disclose
the assumptions made and the judgements included in the going concern review.

As stated in note 2, these events or conditions, along with the other matters as set forth in note 2 to the
financial statements indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the
Group’s and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified in respect of
this matter.

**4.** **Summary of our audit approach**

Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:

           - Impairment of non-current assets in the Dutch and Aravaca clubs;

           - Accuracy of inputs within the IFRS 16 model;

           - Classification of refurbishment expenditure versus capital
expenditure; and

           - Going Concern (see material uncertainty relating to going concern
section).

Within this report, key audit matters are identified as follows:


4MAY202122062600

4MAY202122062713

4MAY202122062940

4MAY202122062374


Newly identified

Increased level of risk

Similar level of risk

Decreased level of risk


Materiality The materiality that we used for the group financial statements was
£6.7m which was based on using a benchmark of not more than 5% of
Earnings before interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization
(‘‘EBITDA’’).

Scoping Our audit scoping has resulted in 99.0% of the group’s revenue, 100% of
profit after tax and 100% of EBITDA being subject to full audit scope
testing.

-----

Significant changes in our The implementation of IFRS 16—Leases has resulted in a Right-of-Use
approach asset and corresponding lease liability being recognised. There is a level
of judgment involved in determining some of the inputs into the model.
The impact is highly material given the group have a large number of
leased clubs. This has therefore been considered a key audit matter in
FY 2019.

The Dutch and Aravaca clubs have historically been loss making. The
onerous leases that were recognised in the prior year relating to these
clubs no longer exist and have been replaced with Right-of-Use assets
under IFRS 16. Therefore a key audit matter has been considered for
FY2019 in respect of impairment of non-current assets held in those
clubs.

The Post Balance Sheet Event of Covid-19 has had a significant impact
on the Group and the Going Concern Basis of accounting adopted in
preparation of the financial statements has been considered a key audit
matter.

**5.** **Key audit matters**

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our
audit of the financial statements of the current year and include the most significant assessed risks of
material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those
which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and
directing the efforts of the engagement team.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. In addition to
the matter described in the material uncertainty relating to going concern section, we have determined the
matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.

5.1. Impairment of non-current assets in the Dutch and Aravaca clubs 4MAY202122062600

Key audit matter Management has performed an impairment review to determine if any
description impairment of non-current asset under IFRS is required in line with
IAS 36 ‘‘Impairment of Assets’’. We have focused our analysis on the
Dutch and Aravaca clubs as they have historically been underperforming.

The non-current asset balances at 31 December 2019 for these clubs are
£6.5m of Property, Plant & Equipment (‘‘PPE’’) and £16.7m Right of
Use (‘‘ROU’’) assets for the Dutch clubs and £7.6m of PPE for Aravaca.
An impairment of £5.4m was identified in Aravaca and on two of the
Dutch clubs totalling £0.5m. The total impairment across the Group was
£10.5m, so the Dutch and Aravaca clubs represents 56% of the Group’s
impairment.

The key judgements in the value-in-use (ViU) calculation are as follows:

           - The future cash flow forecasts of the individual clubs; and

           - The discount rate of 10.5% applied to the future cash flow forecasts
to discount the future cash flows to a present value.

Refer to the significant accounting policies (page 55) and note 13
‘‘Impairment Testing’’ of the Consolidated Financial Statements
(page 71).

How the scope of our Our audit procedures focused on challenging the inputs used to
audit responded to the key determine the value in use of the Dutch and Aravaca clubs and included
audit matter the following:

           - Obtained an understanding of the relevant controls surrounding the
impairment assessment;

           - Assessed management’s indicators of impairment;

           - Involved our internal specialists to challenge the appropriateness of
the discount rate used in the model and assessing the key inputs and
comparison to market evidence;

           - Assessed the reasonableness of the key judgments, around cash flow
projections, made in the value in use model, against industry
expectations and historical performance;

           - Testing management’s ability to accurately forecast future revenues
and growth rates by comparing actual results to management’s
historical forecasts; and

           - Performed a sensitivity analysis on the inputs into the value in use
model to determine if this would materially change any impairment
charge currently recognised.

Key observations We are satisfied that the Directors’ assessment of the impairment
recognised for the Dutch and Aravaca clubs in the year is appropriate.

5.2. Accuracy of inputs within the IFRS 16 model 4MAY202122062600

Key audit matter The new leasing standard, IFRS 16 ‘‘Leases’’, applicable for the first time
description in the year ended 31 December 2019, was adopted by the Group.

Due to the number of leased assets that the Group holds, the application
of IFRS 16 had a significant impact, bringing a Right-of-Use (‘‘ROU’’)
asset of £904.4m and a lease liability of £838.5m onto the statement of
financial position as at 1 January 2019.

For each input into the IFRS 16 model there are multiple judgements to
be taken which would impact the ROU asset and lease liability
calculated. All inputs are entered manually into the model. A small
change in an input could have a material impact on the IFRS 16
balances, and therefore the accuracy of these inputs into the IFRS 16
model have been identified as a key audit matter.

Judgements to be made when inputting a lease into the IFRS 16 model
include:

           - Identifying whether a contract meets the definition of a lease and
should be included in the model;

           - Determining the lease term, including any renewal, termination and
purchase options, as well as rent-free periods;

           - Accounting for various types of lease payments (variable and fixed);

           - Accounting for lease incentives, initial direct costs and dismantling
costs;

           - Accounting for lease modifications;

           - Treatment of previous onerous leases; and

           - Completeness of lease population.

Refer to the significant accounting policies (page 59 to 60) and note 15
‘‘Leases’’ of the Consolidated Financial Statements (page 73 to 75).

           - Obtained an understanding of the relevant controls around the
audit matter
entering of data into the model;

           - Assessed management’s paper on key judgements included in the
model, such as when to recognise an option to extend a lease, how
to account for variable payments and how to reflect clauses for
dilapidations;

           - Tested a sample of lease contracts by obtaining the original lease
agreement and assessing whether all the details input into the model,
such as start/end dates and lease payments, were accurate;

           - Assessed the completeness of the lease population in the model by
performing a reconciliation of the lease payments in the model to
the rental payments; and

           - Assessed the completeness of data points in the model.

Key observations We are satisfied that the data inputs in the IFRS 16 model are
appropriate.

5.3. Classification of refurbishment expenditure versus capital expenditure 4MAY202122062940

Key audit matter At 31 December 2019 total additions during the year were £79.1m
description (2018:£63.3m)

The classification of maintenance and refurbishment expenditure versus
capitalised expenditure has been identified as a key audit matter due to
the level of judgement involved in determining whether an item is capital
in nature or not. If it is determined that an item is capital in nature, it
will be capitalised to Property, Plant and Equipment (‘‘PP&E’’), with the
related annual depreciation charge not being included in EBITDA. Any
maintenance expenditure will be recognised in full within EBITDA within
the year the expense was incurred.

EBITDA is a key performance indicator for the group and therefore we
have identified manipulation of these costs as a potential area for fraud.

Refer to the significant accounting policies (page 54) and note 14
‘‘Property, Plant & Equipment’’ of the Consolidated Financial Statements
(page 72).

How the scope of our The procedures performed to address the key audit matter were:
audit responded to the key

           - Obtained an understanding of the relevant controls around the
audit matter
maintenance and refurbishment expenditure, capital expenditure and
purchasing processes;

           - Tested General IT Controls around the user access and change
management in the system;

           - Substantively tested all material costs capitalised in the year and a
remaining sample of costs to assess whether they met the
capitalisation criteria of IAS 16;

           - Substantively tested a sample of journals posted to the maintenance
and refurbishment expenditure account in the Income Statement to
evaluate the appropriateness of each item; and

           - Performed data analytics to assess if material additions were in line
with expectation on a club by club basis.

Key observations We are satisfied that the classification of costs as Property, Plant and
Equipment assets capitalised in the year is appropriate.

**6.** **Our application of materiality**

6.1. Materiality

We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable
that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We
use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as
follows:

**Group financial statements** **Parent company financial statements**

Materiality £6.7m (2018: £6.0m) £ 5.4m (2018: £5.4m)

Basis for determining We determined materiality using a The determined materiality equates
materiality benchmark of not more than 5% to 1.5% (2018: 1.3%) of the parent
of EBITDA. This is consistent with company’s net assets.
prior year.

Rationale for the This approach has been taken to The parent company is a holding
benchmark applied consider benchmark used by company, which does not trade. It
stakeholders in the business. has therefore been considered that
a materiality determined on net
assets is the most appropriate basis
for a holding entity.

Performance materiality

We set performance materiality at a level lower than materiality to reduce the probability that, in
aggregate, uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceed the materiality for the financial statements
as a whole. Group performance materiality was set at 70% of group materiality for the 2019 audit (2018:
70%). In determining performance materiality, we considered the following factors:

a. our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment; and

b. low number of corrected and uncorrected misstatements in the previous audit.

6.2. Error reporting threshold

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess
of £335k (2018: £300k), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting
on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified
when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.

**7.** **An overview of the scope of our audit**

7.1. Identification and scoping of components

Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the group and its environment, including
group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the group level. The Group
operates clubs principally in the UK, but also elsewhere in Europe and has a centralised finance function
operating in the UK.

Our audit scoping has resulted in 99% (2018: 99.9%) of the Group’s revenue, 100% (2018:100%) of profit
after tax and 100% (2018: 100%) of EBITDA being subject to a full scope audit.

At the Group level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to
confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated
financial information of the remaining components not subject to full scope audit procedures.

All audit work was performed by the group audit team.

**8.** **Other information**

The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information
included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

F-84


-----

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent
otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to
determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement
of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

**9.** **Responsibilities of directors**

As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for
such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent
company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or
the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

**10. Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic. decisions of users taken on the
basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the
FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s
report.

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

**11. Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006**

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

- the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which
the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

- the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and their
environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the
strategic report or the directors’ report.

**12. Matters on which we are required to report by exception**

12.1. Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

- we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

- adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our
audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

F-85


-----

- the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and
returns.

We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

12.2. Directors’ remuneration

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of
directors’ remuneration have not been made.

We have nothing to report in respect of this matter.

**13. Use of our report**

This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of
the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we
have formed.

**Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year ended 31 December 2019**

**1 General information**

The Company is a private company limited by share capital incorporated and domiciled in the United
Kingdom. The address of its registered office is:

The Hangar
Mosquito Way
Hatfield Business Park
AL10 9AX

The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic Report on
page 2.

**2 Significant accounting policies**

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are
set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to both years presented, unless otherwise
stated.

**Basis of preparation**

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations as adopted
by the European Union, and with the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard
101, ‘‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’’ (FRS101).

The consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost
convention, as modified by the revaluation of derivative financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value
through profit and loss, and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the
Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas
where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in
note 3.

As permitted by FRS101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available in
relation to presentation of a cash flow statement; standards not yet effective; business combinations;
non-current assets held for sale; presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets;
impairment of assets; and related party transactions.

**Basis of consolidation**

The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary
undertakings drawn up to 31 December 2019.

No income statement is presented for the Company as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act
2006. The Company made a profit after tax for the financial year of £179,000 (2018: £391,167,000).

Where the Group has control over an investee, it is classified as a subsidiary. The Group controls an
investee if all three of the following elements are present: power over the investee, exposure to variable
returns from the investee and the ability of the investor to use its power to affect those variable returns.
Control is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these
elements of control.

The consolidated financial statements present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries (‘‘the
Group’’) as if they formed a single entity. Intergroup transactions and balances between Group companies
are therefore eliminated in full. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are
included in the income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of

F-94

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries
to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by the Group.

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the
acquisition method. In the statement of financial position, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related
costs are expensed as incurred.

**Going concern**

In preparing the financial statements the Directors are required to assess the Group and Company’s ability
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting. In making this assessment the Directors have considered
the Group and Company’s principal risks, liquidity, business model and cash flow forecast including
downside scenario testing.

_Principal risk_

The Group has identified a new risk in relation to novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The COVID-19
pandemic developed rapidly in 2020, with a significant number of cases. Measures taken by UK and
European governments to contain the virus have affected economic activity and the Group’s business
materially. All our clubs were ordered to be closed on or before 20 March 2020. Our clubs remained closed
for c. four months which prevented the Group generating income and cash. Our European clubs re-opened
in June and our English clubs re-opened on 25 July with Welsh and Scottish clubs re-opening on 10 August
and 31 August, respectively.

As a result, the Group’s EBITDA has declined significantly in 2020 and was negative for the five months
ending 31st July 2020 where most of our clubs were closed.

Future waves of COVID-19 could lead to periods of club closure on a local or even national lockdown
basis resulting in revenue and EBITDA reductions. Furthermore, there remains uncertainty regarding the
recovery of member count and yield due to the potential impact of COVID-19 on member behaviour.

_Liquidity_

As of 31 December 2019, the Group’s financing arrangements consisted of a £947m loan (repayable
December 2024) and access to £40m in revolving credit facilities (‘‘RCFs’’), consisting of two separate
£20m RCFs from the Group’s relationship banks. The RCFs were not drawn at the balance sheet date. The
loan and other finance facilities do not have any financial covenants attached to them and thus liquidity is
the significant risk.

As a precaution, in March 2020 we fully drew our £40m RCFs and these facilities were successfully
extended (notwithstanding our clubs being closed) for a period of 12 months until July 2021. Given the
historic support provided by the lending banks and the super-senior nature of these facilities, the Directors
are confident that the facilities will be renewed again in July 2021.

As of 30 September 2020, the Group had an immediately available cash balance of £46.5m.

Governments in the countries in which we operate announced the implementation of assistance measures
which mitigated some of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results and liquidity. Specifically,
in the UK we utilised the 12-month business rate holiday, tax and VAT payment deferrals and various
employee support schemes including the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme.

In addition to the above, the following key actions were taken to preserve cash:

- Reduced our cost base and mothballed the entire club estate to minimise cash leakage.

- Stopped all discretionary spend and implemented enhanced financial controls over approval of all
spend.

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

- Ceased capital expenditure projects where this was practical.

- Engaged with landlords to manage rent obligations through securing rent-free periods/rent deferrals.

_Business Model_

The David Lloyd business model is underpinned by membership subscribers who have a high degree of
loyalty. Greater than 75% of the Group’s revenues are generated through member subscriptions with
members on 12 month rolling contracts and requiring to provide 3 months’ notice to leave. To retain
member loyalty, the Group decided to freeze all memberships and not take any payments or fees during
COVID related closures. This led to the Group having no income during the closure period. Upon
re-opening of clubs, the Group has resumed taking monthly subscriptions from most of its members, albeit
on a moderately lower member base due to frozen members and direct debit cancellations. As a result, the
Group has moved immediately to generating operating cashflows.

_Cash Flow Forecasts_

In making their assessment of going concern the Directors have considered the forecast cash flows of the
Group and the liquidity available over an eighteen-month period ending March 2022.

The Group’s base case scenario assumes all clubs remain open and operational, and that the RCFs are
renewed in July 2021. Building on record demand since re-opening, our base case assumes strong sales
continue during Q3 and Q4 2020 supported by targeted marketing and sales promotions. The base case
reflects high H2 attrition followed by a gradual recovery of member count and yield to pre-COVID levels
by FY 22. Notwithstanding the impact of COVID closures experienced to date, the Group is expected to
remain EBITDA positive for FY20.

The base case scenario shows the Group has sufficient cash throughout this period with a low point in
October 2020 of c. £34.5m as the Group re-builds cash reserves.

As with most financial models, significant changes to key assumptions could have a material impact on the
timing of revenue, EBITDA and cash the Group will be able to generate.

_Downside Scenario Testing_

The Directors have considered the impact of downside scenarios. These scenarios included further COVID
disruption modelled as localised COVID lock downs and a deep economic recession with a similar impact
on the business as the Financial crisis in 2008-09 as well as the loss of the RCFs, in the event they cannot be
renewed in July 2021. Downside scenarios were tested individually and in aggregate. When all downside
scenarios were aggregated, and if neither of the RCFs are renewed, a liquidity shortfall would arise in July
2021.

In considering the output of downside scenario testing relative to the Group’s going concern position, the
Directors have also considered the additional actions which may be available to mitigate the impact on
liquidity. Key mitigating actions include a sale & leaseback transaction, minimising capital expenditure and
further reductions in discretionary expenditure. Notwithstanding the uncertainties discussed above, the
Directors consider their ability to deliver a level of mitigating actions which protect liquidity to be very
high.

Should further waves of COVID-19 result in a significant period of club closure across many regions
without government support (CJRS Scheme, Business Rates Relief and Tenant protection) the Group
would require additional financing to meet its liabilities as they fall due and continue in operational
existence for at least the next 12 months.

_Conclusion_

The Directors have concluded that the impact of COVID-19 has created unprecedented trading
uncertainty. Whilst the Group has a variety of mitigating actions available to it, these could also be affected

F-96


-----

**Deuce Holdco Limited**

**Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year ended 31 December 2019 (Continued)**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

by the uncertain trading environment. This combination leads the Directors to conclude that the factors
noted in the Downside Scenario Testing section above constitute a material uncertainty which could cast
significant doubt on the Group and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and therefore, it may
be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.

Notwithstanding this material uncertainty, having assessed likely downside scenarios and mitigation
available, the Directors have formed the judgement that it is appropriate to prepare the financial
statements on the going concern basis.

**Revenue recognition**

Revenue is derived from the provision of sport and leisure facilities in the United Kingdom and Europe.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts
receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and
other sales-related taxes.

The Group’s revenues are recognised mainly from the following goods and services:

- Membership subscriptions;

- Administration and joining fees;

- Sale of sports lessons including swimming, tennis and personal training;

- Other product sales, including food and beverage and cr`eche services.

_Membership subscriptions_

Membership subscriptions can be paid annually or monthly by direct debit. Subscriptions are recognised
over the period of membership, with any subscriptions received in advance of the period in which the
service is provided being recorded as a contract liability on the statement of financial position.

_Administration and joining fees_

Administration and joining fees are paid upfront and are non-refundable. They represent a fee for the
initial set up costs of the contract and for the right to renew the membership for no additional fee when the
contract expires. Revenue is recognised in line with when the performance obligations are performed
which is over the average membership period, including any period of renewal. Revenue relating to future
periods of membership are recognised as contract liabilities in the statement of financial position.

The average membership periods over which revenue is recognised are:

Standard membership 24 months
Flexible membership 1 month
Annual membership 24 months

_Sale of sports lessons and personal training_

Sports lessons are paid for upfront at the beginning of the term or monthly by direct debit. Revenue is
recognised over the period that lessons are provided, and any upfront payment is recognised as a contract
liability on the statement of financial position.

Personal training paid for monthly by direct debit or on the date they are taken is recognised in the month
they are paid as this is when the performance obligation is satisfied. Alternatively, personal training
vouchers can be purchased up front in packs of one, four, eight and twelve sessions. The period over which
this revenue should be recognised requires judgement. Historical data shows that on average one personal
training session is used each week for a pack purchased up front. Revenue is therefore recognised on this
basis. Revenue received in relation to future periods are recognised as contract liabilites on the statement
of financial position.

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

_Product sales_

Revenue from food and beverage sales, and other merchandise is recognised at the point of sale.

**Exceptional items**

Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements, where it is necessary to provide
further understanding of the financial performance of the Group. They are items that are material, either
because of their size or their nature, or that are non-recurring.

**Foreign currency transactions and balances**

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency
of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘‘the functional currency’’). The
consolidated financial statements are presented in pound sterling, which is also the Group’s functional
currency.

Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are recognised at the rates of exchange
prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each statement of financial position date, monetary assets
and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that
date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at
the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured
in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Exchange differences are recognised
in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.

On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated into pounds sterling at rates
approximating to those ruling when the transactions took place. All assets and liabilities of overseas
operations, including goodwill arising on the acquisition of those operations, are translated at the rate
ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on translating the opening net assets at opening
rate and the results of overseas operations at actual rate are recognised in other comprehensive income
and accumulated in the foreign exchange reserve.

The average conversion rate during the period was £1: A1.14 (2018: £1: A1.13), and at the statement of
financial position date was £1: A1.18 (2018: £1: A1.13).

**Borrowings**

Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are
subsequently measured at amortised cost. Borrowings are classified as loans within non-current liabilities.

**Borrowing costs**

Costs directly attributable to the refinancing have been capitalised and amortised over the related loan
period. Where fees do not relate directly to a particular loan, they have been apportioned between the
loans based on the total loan principal.

**Tax**

The tax expense for the period comprises current tax and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income
statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or
directly in equity respectively.

The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the
balance sheet date in the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable
income.

Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities
and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are

F-98


-----

**Deuce Holdco Limited**

**Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year ended 31 December 2019 (Continued)**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is not accounted for if it
arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that
at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is
determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of
financial position date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the
deferred tax liability is settled.

Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be
available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and
when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on
either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities and there is an intention to settle the balances on
a net basis.

**Investments**

Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are held at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Land and buildings held for use in the supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, are
stated in the statement of financial position at their net book value, being the fair value at the date of
acquisition less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.

Plant and machinery are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised
impairment loss. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the
item.

**Depreciation**

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over
their useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:

Fixtures and Fittings—between 3 and 20 years
Freehold Buildings—50 years
Freehold land is not depreciated.

The gain or loss arising on the disposal or scrappage of an asset is determined as the difference between
the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit/(loss) on disposal of
PP&E within the income statement.

**Club opening costs**

Site development costs capitalised represent costs incurred in respect of the development of new sites. No
depreciation is charged until the new club is brought into operation.

Costs incurred prior to the date of opening a club which are not directly associated with its acquisition,
construction, refurbishment or fitting out are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.

**Goodwill**

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method or using merger accounting where it
was a common control transaction and the relative rights remained the same before and after the
combination. Under the acquisition method, the cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the
consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling
interest in the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in exceptional
operating expenses.

**Deuce Holdco Limited**

**Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year ended 31 December 2019 (Continued)**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate
classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and
pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.

Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred
over the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in
excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the gain is recognised in profit or loss. Goodwill is
capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated
statement of comprehensive income. Goodwill has been allocated to each geographical region based on its
value in use.

After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the
purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date,
allocated to groups of cash-generating units (‘‘CGU’’) that are expected to benefit from the combination,
irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. The Group is
considered to be the smallest relevant group of CGUs for goodwill impairment testing, as this is the level
at which goodwill is monitored internally.

**Intangible assets**

Intangible assets are recognised on business combinations if they are separable from the acquired entity or
give rise to other contractual/legal rights. The amounts ascribed to such intangibles are arrived at by using
appropriate valuation techniques (see note 3, critical estimates and judgements). They are amortised over
their useful lives from the date of acquisition.

The fair value of clubs held under operating leasehold interest at acquisition are carried as intangible
assets. Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease
terms.

The estimated value of brand names acquired are recorded as intangible fixed assets with indefinite useful
lives and are therefore tested annually for impairment.

An identifiable internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s Information Technology
development is recognised only to the extent its cost can be reliably measured and future economic
benefits will flow to the Group as a result.

Internally-generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives—usually
3 years.

Computer software and licenses are capitalised at cost, and amortised over their useful life or licence
period, where applicable—18 months to 3 years.

**Impairment of tangible and intangible assets**

At each statement of financial position date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and
intangible assets (including goodwill) to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have
suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated
to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that
are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating
unit (‘‘CGU’’) to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for
impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.

Each individual club is considered to be a CGU.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use,
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which
the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

F-100

**Deuce Holdco Limited**

**Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year ended 31 December 2019 (Continued)**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the
carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is
recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is increased
to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for
the asset (or CGU) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or
loss.

Investments are reviewed for impairment based upon their recoverable amount.

**Inventories**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and,
where applicable, overheads that have been incurred in bringing the stocks to their present location and
condition. Cost is calculated using the weighted average method. Net realisable value represents the
estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling
and distribution.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly
liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts.

**Creditors**

Creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Creditors are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.

**Trade and other receivables**

Trade and other receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the
ordinary course of business. Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that
is unconditional, unless they contain significant financing components, when they are recognized at fair
value. The Group holds the trade receivables with the objective of collecting the contractual cash flows and
therefore measures them subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a
lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables.

**Provisions**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a
past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate
can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the
present obligation at the statement of financial position date, taking into account the risks and
uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to
settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows. The amortisation
of the discount is recognised as interest expense.

**Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year ended 31 December 2019 (Continued)**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**Employee benefits**

_Pension obligations_

The Group operates various defined contribution pension plans. The Group pays contributions to privately
administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contracted or voluntary basis. The Group has no
further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an
employee benefit expense. The assets of the scheme are invested and managed independently of the
finances of the Group.

_Share-based payments_

Employees (including senior executives) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based
payments, whereby employees render services as consideration for the right to purchase equity instruments
in the parent company (equity-settled transactions).

No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for equity-settled transactions for
which vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition. These are treated as vesting
irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other
performance and/or service conditions are satisfied.

The fair value at start date of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding
increase in the share-based payment reserve in equity, over the period in which the performance and/or
service conditions are fulfilled. The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each
reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the
Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The income statement
expense or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the
beginning and end of that period and is recognised in employee benefits expense.

When the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense
had the terms not been modified, if the original terms of the award are met. An additional expense is
recognised for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction,
or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.

When an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any
expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. This includes any award where
non-vesting conditions within the control of either the entity or the employee are not met. However, if a
new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that
it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award,
as described in the previous paragraph.

**Employee Benefit Trust**

The Employee Benefit Trust is considered to be controlled by the Group. The activities of the Trust are
conducted on behalf of the Group according to its specific business needs in order to obtain benefits from
its operation and on this basis, the assets held by the Trust are consolidated into the Group’s financial
statements.

**Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity.

**Financial liabilities**

_Classification_

Financial liabilities can be classified as ‘fair value through profit or loss’ or held at amortised cost. All are
initially recognised at fair value, and in the case of loans, net of any transaction costs. Loans are measured

F-102


-----

**Deuce Holdco Limited**

**Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year ended 31 December 2019 (Continued)**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method, with interest expense recognised on an effective
yield basis.

_Recognition and measurement_

The Company derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Company’s obligations are
discharged, cancelled or they expire.

**Financial assets**

_Classification_

The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories: financial assets at fair
value (either through Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) or through profit or loss) and financial assets at
amortised cost.

The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time
of initial recognition. For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will be recorded either in profit or
loss or in OCI.

_Recognition and measurement_

All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of a
financial asset is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the time frame
established by the market concerned.

At initial recognition, the group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial
asset measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, transaction costs that are directly attributable
to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through
profit or loss (FVTPL) are expensed in profit or loss.

Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether
their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest.

_Impairment_

The Group assesses, on a forward-looking basis, the expected credit losses associated with its debt
instruments carried at amortised cost and fair value through profit or loss. Expected credit losses are
measured through a loss allowance at an amount equal to the expected credit losses for the next 12 months
or the expected credit losses over the lifetime of the asset. The impairment methodology applied depends
on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.

For trade receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires
expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.

_Derecognition of financial assets_

The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset
expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of
the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards
of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in
the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all
the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the
financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.

**Leases**

The Group leases various clubs and equipment. Rental contracts are typically made for fixed periods of
12 months to 125 years but may have extension options.

Contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Group allocates the consideration in the
contract to the lease and non-lease components based on their relative stand-alone prices. However, for
leases of real estate for which the company is a lessee and for which it has major leases, it has elected not
to separate lease and non-lease components and instead accounts for these as a single lease component.

Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and
conditions. The lease agreements do not impose any covenants other than the security interests in the
leased assets that are held by the lessor. Leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes.

The Group has entered into commercial property leases and other plant and equipment as a lessee. The
classification of these leases as up until the 2018 financial year were classified as either finance leases or
operating leases. From 1 January 2019, leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding
liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group.

Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities
include the net present value of the following lease payments:

- Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;

- Variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate
as at the commencement date;

- Amounts expected to be payable by the company under residual value guarantees;

- The exercise price of a purchase option if the company is reasonably certain to exercise that option;
and

- Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the company exercising that
option.

Lease payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options are also included in the
measurement of the liability. The lease payments are discounted using the Incremental Borrowing Rate.
This is the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow, over a similar term and with security
funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the cost of the right-of-use asset in a similar
economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions.

The Group is exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments based on an index or rate,
which are not included in the lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments to lease payments
based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability is reassessed and adjusted against the right-of-use
asset.

Lease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or
loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of
the liability for each period.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:

- The amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;

- Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;

- Any initial direct costs; and

- Restoration costs.

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term
on a straight-line basis. If the company is reasonably certain to exercise a purchase option, the right-of-use
asset is depreciated over the underlying asset’s useful life.

Lease income from operating leases where the Group is a lessor is recognised in income on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. Initial direct costs incurred in obtaining an operating lease are added to the
carrying amount of the underlying asset and recognised as expense over the lease term on the same basis as
lease income. The respective leased assets are included in the balance sheet based on their nature. The
Group did not need to make any adjustments to the accounting for assets held as lessor as a result of
adopting the new leasing standard.

Payments associated with short-term leases of equipment and all leases of low-value assets are recognised
on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of
12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment.

Information about critical accounting estimates and judgements in the application of lease accounting is
disclosed in note 3.

The Group has changed its accounting policy for leases where the company is the lessee. The impact of the
change is explained in note 33. Prior to this change, leases of property, plant and equipment where the
Group, as lessee, had substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership were classified as finance leases.
Finance leases were capitalised at the lease’s inception at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower,
the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance
charges, were included in current and non-current liabilities as finance leases. Each lease payment was
allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost was charged to profit or loss over the
lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability
for each period. The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases was depreciated over
the asset’s useful life, or over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term if there was no
reasonable certainty that the Group would obtain ownership at the end of the lease term.

Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership were not transferred to the
Group as lessee were classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any
incentives received from the lessor) were charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of
the lease.

**3 Critical accounting estimates and judgements**

Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

**Critical accounting estimates and assumptions**

The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The related accounting estimates will,
by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the
next financial year are addressed below:

_Lease accounting_

The lease payments are discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate, being the rate that the
individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the
right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions.

To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group has considered three main risk premiums
(adjustments) being: reference rate, credit risk premium and asset specific adjustment.

Reference rate (risk free rate)—In assessing the relevant reference rate, we have taken into account
currency, economic environment and unexpired terms of the leases. Relevant government bond yields have
been used as a proxy for the risk free rate.

Credit risk premium—The Group have estimated an additional credit risk to reflect the difference in risk
profile between a Government bond and another debt security with the same maturity.

Asset (lease) specific adjustment—The Group have used property yields as a proxy to differentiate
between different property types and locations. The asset specific adjustment has been based on property
initial yield benchmarks taking into account the expected annual rental growth rate and the expected
annual building depreciation rate.

The key factors influencing the discount rate are:

- Economic environment/country;

- Length of Lease;

- Lessee entity;

- Type of collateral;

- Rent review mechanism in the lease i.e. contingent market rent reviews versus fixed increases or
indexation.

**Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year ended 31 December 2019 (Continued)**

**3 Critical accounting estimates and judgements (Continued)**

The Group developed a categorisation of leases and a matrix of discount rates to reflect the specific factors
above. The calculated incremental borrowing rates (IBR) range between 2.8%—9.0% translating to an
average rate of 6.8%. A 5-basis point increase/(decrease) in the rate would cause the lease liabilities to
increase/(decrease) by £6.1m and a corresponding increase/(decrease) in the right-of-use assets of £6.5m.
The IBR can change due to the type of leases that are held by the Group, the economic environment, the
lease terms and asset types. There have been no changes since the calculation of the rate therefore the
Group has made no adjustments during the year presented.

_Key assumptions used for assessing goodwill for impairment_

The Group tests whether goodwill has suffered any impairment on an annual basis. The Group is
considered to be the smallest relevant group of CGUs for goodwill impairment testing, as this is the level
at which goodwill is monitored internally. The Group has determined the recoverable amount through
estimating the fair value less costs of disposal using a multiple of EBITDA approach. The Group used a
multiple of 9. Sensitivity to changes in this assumption are disclosed in note 13.

_Key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations_

The Group tests the carrying amounts of individual club non-current assets for impairment for those clubs
that meet pre-defined impairment indicators. For the 2019 and 2018 reporting periods, the recoverable
amount of the cash-generating units (CGUs) was determined based on value-in-use calculations which
require the use of assumptions. The calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets and
business plans approved by management covering a three-year period. Cash flows beyond the three-year
period are extrapolated using an estimated growth rate of 1.9%. This growth rate is consistent with
forecasts specific to the industry and the country in which each CGU operates. The pre-tax discount rate of
10.5% has been determined based on the weighted average cost of capital. Sensitivity to changes in
assumptions are disclosed within note 13.

The Group has concluded COVID-19 to be a non-adjusting post balance sheet event as of 31 December
2019, but its impact will be assessed in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020.

**Critical judgements in applying the entity’s accounting policies**

_Lease accounting_

In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic
incentive to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option. Periods covered by an
option to extend the lease term are included in the lease term if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise
that option. The same rationale applies to termination options.

Significant judgement is involved in determining the period over which a lease is considered to be
‘enforceable’. Where contracts have a term of greater than 10 years remaining at transition, the Group
assesses there to be an unclear indication that it would in substance be deemed to be ‘enforceable’ beyond
the original contractual term, despite the rights provided by the The Landlord and Tenant Act 1954. The
lease end date has therefore been used as the end date for the lease. For leases due to expire within
10 years of transition, the likelihood of extension is being assessed up to the year end with reference to the
facts available and looking at the Group’s history of renewing leases beyond the contractual end date.

For the current leases held by the Group, we currently conclude the minimum lease term to be the term of
the lease contract. We assess, based on our current plans or expectations, the situation for each lease for
which options to extend, terminate or purchase exist annually and judgement will be applied in the
weighting of relevant factors in each case.

_Judgements in determining the timing of satisfaction of performance obligations under IFRS15_

The timing of satisfaction of performance obligations of administration and joining fees for members
requires judgment. Administration and joining fees represent a fee for the initial set-up costs of the

contract and for the right to renew the membership for no additional fee when the contract expires. The
set-up costs are critical to the contract with the new member, but they do not satisfy performance
obligations, as no good or service is transferred to the member. The member effectively pays for the future
right of renewing their membership for no additional fee. It is at these renewal dates that the performance
obligation is fulfilled, therefore it is appropriate to release the revenue over the total membership period,
which includes any renewal period. Historical data and trends have been used to determine the average
period of membership and number of renewals for each package type.

In making their judgement, the directors have considered the detailed criteria for the recognition of
revenue set out in IFRS 15. Following the detailed review of the Group’s membership base and historic
trends, the directors are satisfied and that recognition of the revenue in the current year is appropriate.

therefore separately disclosed.

The tax effect of the exceptional items disclosed above was credit £1,776,000 (2018: credit £2,289,000) due
to the increase in deferred tax assets as a result of the above items.

Exceptional items listed above generated a net cash outflow of £2,123,000 (2018: £9,040,000).

The cost of inventories recognised as an expense and included in cost of sales amounted to £16.8m (2018:
£16.7m). This includes inventory write downs of £0.9m (2018: £0.9m).

In accordance with IFRS 16 operating lease expense in the current year represents turnover rent, service
charge and service charge insurance.

The Group initially applied IFRS 16 at 1 January 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. Under
this approach operating lease expense is replaced with the depreciation of right-of-use assets within other
operating expenses, and interest on lease liabilities as disclosed in note 15.

The Group initially applied IFRS 16 at 1 January 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. Under
this approach comparative information is not restated and the cumulative effect of initially applying
IFRS 16 is recognised in retained earnings at the date of the initial application. In 2018 interest expense
relating to lease liabilities is for finance leases under IAS 17 while in 2019 the interest expense is for lease
liabilities under IFRS 16.

UK Corporation tax is calculated at 19 per cent (prior period 19 per cent) of the estimated taxable profit
for the period. Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective
jurisdictions.

The Finance Bill 2016 included provisions to reduce the main rate of corporation tax to 17% from 1 April
2020. However, in the March 2020 Budget it was announced that the cut in the rate to 17% will now not
occur and the Corporation Tax Rate will be held at 19%. As this has not been enacted by the balance sheet
date, balances as at 31 December 2019 continue to be measured at 17%. The impact the amended tax rate
would cause has been disclosed in note 25.

The tax credit for the year is higher (2018: lower) than the standard rate of corporation tax. The
differences are explained below:

The prior year adjustment of £1.7m credit (2018: £4.0m credit) primarily relates to the analysis of the tax
treatment of exceptional items and fixed assets where further information is now available on the nature of
these costs.

**13 Impairment testing**

Goodwill and brands with indefinite lives are subject to an annual impairment test. Club impairments of
tangible fixed assets are allocated to individual clubs as these are considered to be separate cash generating
units (CGUs) at which the Group monitors performance. Goodwill acquired through business
combinations and brands with indefinite lives have been allocated to separate CGUs based on the

**Deuce Holdco Limited**

**Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year ended 31 December 2019 (Continued)**

**13 Impairment testing (Continued)**

acquisition date on which the goodwill arose, as they are monitored at this level by the Board. The Group
is considered the smallest group of CGUs for the allocation of goodwill and impairment testing.

**Key assumptions used in value in use calculations**

The recoverable amount of tangible fixed assets is determined based on a value in use calculation using
cash flow projections from financial budgets approved by senior management. The pre-tax discount rate
applied to cash flow projections is 10.50% (2018: 11.25%) and cash flows beyond the five-year period are
extrapolated using a 1.9% growth rate (2018: 1.9%). The discount rate has been adjusted to reflect the
changes in the capital structure of the Group and market conditions.

Discount rate—the discount rate calculation is based on the specific circumstances of the Group and is
derived from its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC takes into account both debt and
equity where the cost of equity is derived from the expected return on investment by the Group’s investors
and the cost of debt is based on the interest bearing borrowings the Group is obliged to service.

**Sensitivity to changes in assumptions for goodwill**

Any change to the above key assumption could have a material impact on the recoverable amount; which is
then compared to the carrying value of the cash generating unit to determine if there is an impairment.
The Group has been assessed for goodwill impairment at the period end by estimating the fair value less
costs of disposal using a multiple of EBITDA approach. The calculated goodwill headroom using a
multiple of 9 is £444m and changing this multiple down to 5 results in a negative headroom of £109,000.

**Sensitivity to changes in assumptions for tangible fixed assets**

With regard to the assessment of value in use, a change in any of the above key assumptions could have a
material impact on the carrying value of the cash generating unit. Clubs have been assessed for impairment
at the period end by comparing the carrying value of tangible fixed assets for each CGU against the higher
of value in use and valuation. There would only be a material impact on the long-term growth rate if the
Group had no growth. The sensitivity of the club impairments to changes in the discount rate and
long-term growth rates is shown below:

For the purposes of property, plant and equipment impairment reviews, the Group considers each club to
be an individual cash-generating unit (CGU), with each CGU reviewed annually for indicators of
impairment. The Group compared the carrying value of property, plant and equipment to the estimated
value in use. This was calculated based on projected cash flows to 2021, using a discount factor of 10.50%
(2018: 11.25%). This has resulted in a total impairment charge of £7.9m (2018: £0.1m).

The Group has applied IFRS 16 effective 1 January 2019 using the modified retrospective approach, this
has resulted in an adjustment to property, plant and equipment, see note 33.

**(iii) Future minimum lease payments as at 31 December 2019 are as follows:**

The Group initially applied IFRS 16 at 1 January 2019, using the modified retrospective approach. Under
this approach, comparative information is not restated and the cumulative effect of initially applying
IFRS 16 is recognised in retained earnings at the date of initial application. Thus, the comparative future
minimum lease payments presented are based on IAS 17 while the current year are based on IFRS 16.

The total cash outflow for leases in 2019 was £72.6m (2018: £7.8m).

**(iv) Obligations under operating leases**

On application of IFRS16 at 1 January 2019, operating leases that fall within the scope of IFRS16 are
recognised as a right-of-use asset with a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is
available for use by the Group. As a result, all lease commitments presented for the period to
31 December 2018 are included within right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Comparative information
has not been restated and is presented under IAS 17.

Goodwill and brands are not amortised but tested annually for impairment. The brand is considered to
have an indefinite life due to the history and market position of the trade name.

The Group has applied IFRS 16 effective 1 January 2019 using the modified retrospective approach, this
has resulted in an adjustment to lease asset below market rent, see note 33.

**22 Financial risk management and impairment of financial assets**

**Group**

In common with all other businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial
instruments. This note describes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks
and the methods used to measure them. Further quantitative information in respect of these risks is
presented throughout these financial statements.

**Deuce Holdco Limited**

**Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year ended 31 December 2019 (Continued)**

**22 Financial risk management and impairment of financial assets (Continued)**

The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group’s risk management objectives and
policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing
and operating processes that ensure the effective implementation of the objectives and policies to the
Group’s finance function.

The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without
unduly affecting the Group’s competitiveness and flexibility. Further details regarding these policies are set
out below:

**Credit risk and impairment**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument
fails to meet its contractual obligations. The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade
debtors. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, which
is made where there is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows. The credit risk of the
Group is minimised as customers pay by direct debit in advance.

Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions.
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with minimum rating ‘‘A’’ are
accepted. Further disclosures regarding trade and other receivables, which are neither past due nor
impaired, are provided in note 18.

**Market risk**

**Foreign exchange risk**

Foreign exchange risk arises when individual Group entities enter into transactions denominated in a
currency other than their functional currency. The Group’s policy is, where possible, to allow Group
entities to settle liabilities denominated in their functional currency with the cash generated from their own
operations in that currency. Where Group entities have liabilities denominated in a currency other than
their functional currency (and have insufficient reserves of that currency to settle them), cash already
denominated in that currency will, where possible, be transferred from elsewhere within the Group.

**_Sensitivity analysis_**

Sensitivity of balance sheet movements in the Euro exchange rate are shown below:

Loss after tax . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (4,711) 54,844 50,133 (4,986) 6,094

**Interest rate risk**

The Group’s sensitivity to change in the interest rate is limited as the loan has a fiscal interest rate of 10%.

The Revolving Credit Facilities are subject to variable rates based on LIBOR, but no funds were drawn
down on these facilities by the year end.

**Commodity price risk**

The Group manages its exposure to electricity and gas price risk by purchasing its utility requirements in
advance through industry leading advisers. For 2020, 100% of the UK electricity volumes and 88% of the
UK gas volumes, and we have purchased 27% of our electricity and 55% of our gas volumes for 2021.

**Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year ended 31 December 2019 (Continued)**

**22 Financial risk management and impairment of financial assets (Continued)**

Unused utility volumes are sold back to the market with the group liable for any losses due to lower
pricing.

**Capital risk**

Capital risk arises from the management of the capital structure, which consists mainly of the loans and
borrowings detailed in note 21 and shareholder equity. The capital structure should be managed to ensure
the Group can remain a going concern, and to maximise shareholder funds. Detailed cash flow forecasts
based on expected working capital requirements and expected capital projects are maintained throughout
the year to ensure that the Group has sufficient funds to operate as a going concern using the available
facilities.

**Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital, loan facilities and the finance
charges on its debt instruments. To ensure that the Group always has sufficient cash to meet its liabilities, it
seeks to maintain cash balances (or agreed facilities) to meet expected requirements according to
predicted cash flows.

**22 Financial risk management and impairment of financial assets (Continued)**

**Financial instruments not measured at fair value**

Financial instruments not measured at fair value includes all of the above.

Due to their short-term nature, the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other
receivables, trade and other payables and finance leases approximates their fair value.

**Fair value measurement**

Any fair value measurement is categorised within the fair value hierarchy:

- Level 1—Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

- Level 2—Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement is directly or indirectly observable; and

- Level 3—Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement is unobservable.

The fair value of the bank borrowings as disclosed in Note 21 was measured using Level 2 techniques. It is
based on national lending rates on similar loans from information released by the Bank of England.

Where the fair valuations are on a recurring basis the Group determines whether transfers have occurred
between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is
significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

There have not been any transfers between levels in the hierarchy for any financial instruments.

**23 Share-based payments**

**Scheme details and movements**

Under the Management Incentive Plan (‘‘MIP’’) senior executives of the Group are entitled to purchase B,
C, D and E ordinary shares. The B, C, D and E ordinary shares are entitled to participate in proceeds on a
sale of the Group in accordance with the Articles of the Company. Members of the plan must remain
employees of the Group in order to retain their full entitlement to participate in proceeds. There are no
other vesting conditions. The intrinsic value (being the difference between the cash paid and the fair value)
at the date of grant is recognised as an equity-settled share based payment and spread on a straight-line
basis over the vesting period.

On 14th February 2019, 192,500 D ordinary shares and 216,800 E ordinary shares with a nominal value of
£1 each were issued by Deuce Holdco Limited to senior managers for consideration of £10 per share. The
share issue was partly funded by a limited recourse loan from Deuce Holdco Limited, which has been
written off through distributable reserves.

On 1st August 2019, 10,000 D ordinary shares and 28,150 E ordinary shares with a nominal value of £1
each were issued by Deuce Holdco Limited to senior managers for consideration of £10 per share. The
share issue was funded by a limited recourse loan from Deuce Holdco Limited, which has been written off
through distributable reserves.

The expense recognised in employee expenses during the year is £4.1m (2018: £0.1m credit).

The Group has applied IFRS 16 effective 1 January 2019, using the modified retrospective approach this
has resulted in an adjustment to provisions of £48,438,000 (see note 33).

Other provisions relate to a retention guarantee that has been withheld by the Group in relation to the
Aravaca land purchase, and estimated dilapidation costs for the Solihull, Maidenhead, Maidstone and
Kingston clubs.

**25 Deferred tax**

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so. The
following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances (after offset) for financial reporting purposes. These
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not offset because these balances do not unwind on the same basis.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been recognised at the main rate of corporation tax in the relevant
jurisdiction prevailing at the expected date of unwind on the statement of financial position date. In the
UK the long term corporation tax rate of 17% enacted as at 31 December 2019 is used however the UK
government has subsequently announced in the 2020 Budget that the corporation tax rate will remain at
19%. This revised rate would increase the deferred tax liabilities by £20.6m and the deferred tax assets by
£11.7m resulting in a net increase in the statement of financial position liabilities of £8.9m.

In addition to the recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities above, the Group has unrecognised
deferred tax assets of £3.8m (2018: £4.7m) in relation to carried forward losses where it is not sufficiently
probable they will be utilised against future profits.

**27 Share capital (Continued)**

On 14th February 2019, 192,500 D ordinary shares and 216,800 E ordinary shares with a nominal value of
£1 each were issued by Deuce Holdco Limited to senior managers for consideration of £10 per share.

On 1st August 2019, 10,000 D ordinary shares and 28,150 E ordinary shares with a nominal value of £1
each were issued by Deuce Holdco Limited to senior managers for consideration of £10 per share. At
31 December 2019 the Employee Benefit Trust holds 11,650 E ordinary shares.

**Dividends**

The Group paid £2.1m (2018: £393.5m) of dividends during the year, which had been accrued at
31 December 2018.

**28 Commitments**

**Group**

**Capital commitments**

At the statement of financial position date, the Group had committed to providing spa retreats at two
existing sites, Northwood and Cheadle. The total amount contracted for but not provided in the financial
statements was £3.6m (2018: £13.4m).

**29 Post balance sheet events**

On 30 January 2020, DLL Greenwich GmbH, an entity outside the Group, but related by virtue of a
common ultimate controlling party, purchased the entire issued share capital of Meridian Spa & Fitness
Deutschland GmbH and its subsidiaries (known as the ‘‘Meridian Group’’) which consists of eight health
and spa clubs from leasehold premises in Germany. On the same date, Deuce Topco Limited and DLL
Greenwich GmbH entered into an agreement with David Lloyd Leisure Limited (‘‘DLL’’) whereby DLL
will provide certain management and operation services and to license the Trade Marks to the Meridian
Group. In consideration for the provision of these services, Deuce Topco Limited (the Company’s parent)
granted DLL (a subsidiary of the Company) an option to acquire the entire issued share capital of DLL
Greenwich Limited, which is the parent undertaking of DLL Greenwich GmbH. The option is exercisable
at any period from 30 January 2020 to 30 January 2023.

On 30 September 2020, Meridian Spa & Fitness Deutschland GmBH, an entity outside of the Group, but
related by virtue of a common ultimate controlling party, acquired Geneva Country Club for CHF 11.5m.

The COVID-19 pandemic has developed rapidly in 2020, with a significant number of cases. Measures
taken by UK and European governments to contain the virus have affected economic activity and the
group’s business materially. All our clubs were ordered to be closed on or before 20 March 2020. Our clubs
remained closed for c. four months which prevented the Group generating income and cash.

As a result, the Group’s EBITDA has declined significantly in 2020 and was negative for the five months
ending 31st July 2020 where most of our clubs were closed.

The Group’s liquidity was adversely impacted. As a precaution, in March 2020 we fully drew our £40m
RCFs and these facilities were successfully extended (notwithstanding our clubs being closed) for a period
of 12 months until July 2021. Given the historic support provided by the lending banks and the supersenior nature of these facilities, the Directors are confident that the facilities will be renewed again in July
2021.

Governments in the countries in which we operate announced the implementation of assistance measures
which mitigated some of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results and liquidity. Specifically,
in the UK we utilised the 12-month business rate holiday, tax and VAT payment deferrals and various
employee support schemes including the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme.

**29 Post balance sheet events (Continued)**

In addition to the above, the following key actions were taken to preserve cash:

- Reduced our cost base and mothballed the entire club estate to minimise cash leakage.

- Stopped all discretionary spend and implemented enhanced financial controls over approval of all
spend.

- Ceased capital expenditure projects where this was practical.

- Engaged with landlords to manage rent obligations through securing rent-free periods/rent deferrals.

Our European clubs re-opened in June and our English clubs re-opened on 25 July with Welsh and
Scottish clubs re-opening on 10 August and 31 August, respectively. Upon re-opening we have introduced
social distancing and enhanced hygiene measures in clubs to keep members and team members safe.

Uncertainty as to the future impact on the Group of the COVID-19 outbreak has been considered as part
of the Group’s adoption of the going concern basis. The Group and Company’s ‘going concern’ review is
set out in detail in note 2 on pages 49 to 51. The Group considers COVID-19 to be a non-adjusting post
balance sheet event as of 31 December 2019.

**30 Contingent liabilities**

From time to time, the Group is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary
course of business. A liability is recorded only when it is probable that the case will result in a future
economic outflow which can be reliably measured.

In the Directors’ opinion, after taking appropriate legal advice, it is not considered probable that a
material outflow of economic benefits will occur in relation to any ongoing claims.

**31 Related party transactions**

**Key management personnel**

Key management personnel are those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing
and controlling the activity of the Group, including the Directors and senior management of the Group
listed on pages 21 to 22.

**32 Parent and ultimate parent undertaking**

At the statement of financial position date the Company’s immediate parent is Deuce Topco Limited, a
Company incorporated in the United Kingdom and registerd in England and Wales. The financial
statements of Deuce Topco Limited can be obtianed from the Register of Companies, Companies House,
Crown Way, Maindy, Cardiff, CF14 3YZ. The ultimate parent of the Company is Deuce Holding S.`a r.l.
and the ultimate controlling party is a group of investment funds managed by TDR Capital LLP
(registered office: 20 Bentinck Street, London W1U 2EU).

**33 Effect of adoption of IFRS 16—Leases**

The Group has adopted IFRS 16 Leases retrospectively from 1 January 2019 but has not restated
comparatives for the 2018 reporting period, as permitted under the specific transition provisions in the
standard. The reclassifications and the adjustments arising from the new leasing rules are therefore
recognised in the opening balance sheet on 1 January 2019. The new accounting policies are disclosed on
page 59 to 60.

On adoption of IFRS 16, the Group recognised lease liabilities in relation to leases which had previously
been classified as ‘operating leases’ under the principles of IAS 17 Leases. These liabilities were measured
at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing
rate as of 1 January 2019. The weighted average lessee’s incremental borrowing rate applied to the lease
liabilities on 1 January 2019 was 6.8%.

For leases previously classified as finance leases the entity recognised the carrying amount of the lease
asset and lease liability immediately before transition as the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset and
the lease liability at the date of initial application. The measurement principles of IFRS 16 are only applied
after that date.

_Practical expedients applied_

In applying IFRS16 for the first time, the Group has used the following practical expedients permitted by
the standard:

- Applying a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics;

- Relying on previous assessments on whether leases are onerous applying IAS 37 Provisions,
Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets immediately before the date of initial application, as an
alternative to performing an impairment review;

- Accounting for operating leases with a remaining lease term of less than 12 months as at 1 January
2019 as short-term leases;

- Excluding initial direct costs for the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial
application; and

- Using hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contains options to extend or
terminate the lease.

The Group has also elected not to reassess whether a contract is, or contains, a lease at the date of initial
application. Instead, for contracts entered into before the transition date the company relied on its
assessment made applying IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease.

**Deuce Holdco Limited**

**Independent Auditor’s Report to the members of Deuce Holdco Limited**

**Report on the audit of the financial statements**

**Opinion**

**In our opinion:**

- **the financial statements of Deuce Holdco Limited (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the**
**‘group’) give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at**
**31 December 2018 and of the group’s loss for the year then ended;**

- **the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International**
**Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union ;**

- **the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United**
**Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, including Financial Reporting Standard 101**
**‘‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’’; and**

- **the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies**
**Act 2006.**

We have audited the financial statements which comprise of the:

- Consolidated Income Statement;

- Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income;

- Consolidated Statement of Financial Position;

- Parent Company Statement of Financial Position;

- Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity;

- Parent Company Statement of Changes in Equity;

- Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows; and

- the related notes 1 to 35.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial
statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting
framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 ‘‘Reduced Disclosure
Framework’’ (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and
applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the, auditor’s
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.

We are independent of the group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that
are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council’s
(the ‘FRC’s’) Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Summary of our audit approach**

**Key audit matters** The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:

           - Onerous leases in certain loss making clubs; and

           - Classification of maintenance or refurbishment expenditure versus
capital expenditure.

**Materiality** The materiality that we used for the group financial statements was
£5.99m which was based on using a benchmark of not more than 5% of
adjusted earnings of £120m, being Earnings before Interest, Tax,
Depreciation and Amortisation (‘‘EBITDA’’).

**Scoping** Our audit scoping has resulted in 99.9% of the group’s revenue, 100% of
profit after tax and 100% of EBITDA being subject to audit testing.

**Conclusions relating to going concern**

We are required by ISAs (UK) to report in respect of the following **We have nothing to report**
matters where: **in respect of these matters.**

- the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in
preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or

- the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any
identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about
the group’s or the parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the
going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve
months from the date when the financial statements are authorised
for issue.

**Key audit matters**

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our
audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of
material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those
which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and
directing the efforts of the engagement team.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

**Onerous leases in certain loss making clubs**

**Key audit matter** In the current year the onerous leases balance relating to certain clubs is
**description** £14.4m (2017: £15.7m).


4MAY202122062487


High levels of judgement involved in determining the value of the
onerous lease. The relevant clubs identified within the Group have a
forecasted rental spend that is in excess of Earnings Before Interest, Tax,
Depreciation, Amortisation and Rent (‘‘EBITDAR’’) and accordingly
there is a risk that the lease for those clubs is onerous.

IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets requires
a provision to be recognised when a lease contract is onerous at the least
cost of exiting or fulfilling the lease.

Due to the significant degree of judgement involved, we have identified a
key audit matter around the assumptions applied by management relating
to EBITDAR growth assumptions and the discount rate.

Onerous leases are included as an area,of key estimation uncertainty in

**matter**
relating to the valuation and completeness of the onerous leases;


4MAY202122062261



- If the onerous lease was based on a value in use calculation:

  - reviewed and challenged the projected club EBITDAR included
in the calculations; and

  - Working with our valuation specialists, challenged the discount
rate used to discount the future EBITDA.

- If the onerous lease was based on a fair value less cost to sell,
reviewed and challenged the valuation methods used to value the
applicable clubs;

- Assessed the completeness of the onerous lease provision; and

- Reviewed the associated accounting disclosures for completeness and
accuracy.

**Classification of maintenance or refurbishment expenditure versus capital expenditure**

**Key audit matter** In the current year there were total additions, of £63.6m (2017: £35.9m)
**description** relating to the refurbishment of clubs and new gym equipment.


4MAY202122062827


4MAY202122062487


The classification of maintenance and refurbishment expenditure versus
capitalised expenditure has been identified as a key audit matter due to
the level of judgement involved in determining whether an item is capital
in nature or not. If it is determined that an item is capital in nature, it
will be capitalised to Property, Plant and Equipment (‘‘PP&E’’), with the
related annual depreciation charge not being included in EBITDA. Any
maintenance expenditure will be recognised in full within EBITDA within
the year the expense was incurred.

EBITDA is a key performance indicator for the group and therefore we
have identified manipulation of these costs as a potential area for fraud.

The net book value of property, plant and equipment and the additions
incurred for the year is disclosed in note 16.

**How the scope of our audit** We performed the following audit work around this key audit matter;
**responded to the key audit**

           - Evaluated the design and implementation of the relevant controls
**matter**
relating to the capitalisation of fixed assets;


4MAY202122062261



- Tested a sample of costs capitalised by tracing to supporting
documentation and assessing whether the items met the
capitalisation criteria of IAS 16;

- Tested a sample of credits to maintenance expenditure by tracing to
supporting documentation and assessing whether these credits were
appropriate; and.

- Performed data analytics on a club by club basis to determine if
additions were in line with expectations.


4MAY202122062261


**Key observations** We are satisfied that the classification of costs as Property, Plant and
Equipment assets capitalised in the year is appropriate

**Our application of materiality**

We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable
that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We
use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as
follows:

**Group financial statements £’000** **Parent company financial statements £’000**

**Materiality** £5,990 £5,399

**Basis for determining** The materiality that we used for the The basis for determining materiality
**materiality** group financial statements was £5.99m has taken into account the net assets
which was based on using a of the company and also the
benchmark of not more than 5% of component materiality.
adjusted earnings of £120m, being
The determined materiality equates to

(‘‘EBITDA’’).

**Rationale for the** This approach has been taken to The parent company is a holding
**benchmark applied** consider a balanced portfolio of company, which does not trade. It has
benchmarks used by stakeholders in therefore been considered that a
the business. materiality determined on net assets
is the most approriate basis for a
holding entity.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess
of £300,000, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on
qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when
assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.

**An overview of the scope of our audit**

Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the group and its environment, including
group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the group level. The group
operates clubs principally in the UK, but also elsewhere in Europe and has a centralized finance function
operating in the UK.

Our audit scoping has resulted in 99.9% of the group’s revenue, 100% of profit after tax and 100% of
EBITDA being subject to a full scope audit.

At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to
confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated
financial information of the remaining components not subject to full scope audit procedures.

All work was performed by the group audit team. The audit team performed visits to the French and
Italian operations during the year.

**Other information**

The directors are responsible for the other information. The other **_We have nothing to report in_**
information comprises the information included in the Strategic Report **_respect of these matters._**
and the Directors’ Report, other than the financial statements and our
auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other
information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our
report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears
to be materially misstated.

If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material
misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material
misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of
the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information,
we are required to report that fact.

**Responsibilities of directors**

As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for
such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent
company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or
the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the
basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the
FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

**Report on other legal and regulatory requirements**

**Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006**

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

- the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which
the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

- the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and of the parent company and their
environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the
strategic report or the directors’ report.

**Deuce Holdco Limited**

**Notes to the Financial Statements for the Period 4 January 2018 to 31 December 2018**

**1 General information**

The Company is a private company limited by share capital incorporated and domiciled in the United
Kingdom.

The address of its registered office is:

The Hangar
Mosquito Way
Hatfield Business Park
AL10 9AX

The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic Report on
page 2.

**2 Significant accounting policies**

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are
set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to both years presented, unless otherwise
stated.

**Merger accounting**

On 21 September 2018, the Company acquired 100% of the ordinary share capital and voting rights of
Deuce Midco Limited (‘‘Midco’’) from its immediate parent, Deuce Group S.a.r.l, and transferred its
shareholding in Deuce Acquisitions Limited (‘‘DAL’’) to Midco in exchange for £660m. Subsequently, the
Company acquired 100% of the ordinary share capital and voting rights of David Lloyd Clubs Holdings
Limited (‘‘DLCH’’) from its immediate parent by way of a share-for-share exchange, which was
contributed down through the Group by way of further share-for-share exchanges.

In accordance with IFRS 3 the transaction was considered to fall within the scope of a common control
transaction requiring merger accounting principles in accordance with IFRS 3 as the ultimate
shareholders, and their relative rights, remained the same before and after the combination.

Under merger accounting principles, the results and cash flows of all the combining entities have been
brought into the consolidated financial statements of the combined entity from the beginning of the
financial year in which the combination occurs. The comparative figures have been restated to reflect the
results of all the combining entities for the previous year and their balance sheets for the previous balance
sheet date.

**Basis of preparation**

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations as adopted
by the European Union, and with the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard
101, ‘‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’’ (FRS101).

The consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost
convention, as modified by the revaluation of derivative financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value
through profit and loss, and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the
Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas
where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in
note 3.

As permitted by FRS101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available in
relation to presentation of a cash flow statement; standards not yet effective; business combinations;

F-147

**Deuce Holdco Limited**

**Notes to the Financial Statements for the Period 4 January 2018 to 31 December 2018 (Continued)**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

non-current assets held for sale; presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets;
impairment of assets; and related party transactions.

**Basis of consolidation**

The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary
undertakings drawn up to 31 December 2018.

No income statement is presented for the Company as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act
2006. The Company made a profit after tax for the financial year of £391,167,000 (2017: £208,000).

Where the Group has control over an investee, it is classified as a subsidiary. The Group controls an
investee if all three of the following elements are present: power over the investee, exposure to variable
returns from the investee and the ability of the investor to use its power to affect those variable returns.
Control is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these
elements of control.

The consolidated financial statements present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries (‘‘the
Group’’) as if they formed a single entity. Intergroup transactions and balances between Group companies
are therefore eliminated in full. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are
included in the income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of
disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries
to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by the Group.

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the
acquisition method. In the statement of financial position, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related
costs are expensed as incurred.

**Going concern**

The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development and
position, are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 15.

The Directors note that as at 31 December 2018, the Group is in a net liabilities position of £472.6m (2017:
£61.6m) and a net current liabilities position of £54.7m (2017: £129.2m). In preparing these consolidated
financial statements management has drawn up forecasts based on expected working capital requirements
and expected capital projects which indicate that the Group will have sufficient cash to operate. The
Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for at least twelve months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. Thus they adopt the going
concern basis of accounting in preparing these financial statements.

**Revenue recognition**

In the current period, the Group has applied IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (as
amended in April 2016). IFRS 15 introduces a 5-step approach to revenue recognition. Far more
prescriptive guidance has been added in IFRS 15 to deal with specific scenarios. Details of these new
requirements as well as their impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements are described below.

The Group has applied IFRS 15 retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard
recognised as an opening balance sheet adjustment to retained earnings.

IFRS 15 uses the terms ‘contract asset’ and ‘contract liability’ to describe what might more commonly be
known as ‘accrued revenue’ and ‘deferred revenue’, however the Standard does not prohibit an entity from
using alternative descriptions in the statement of financial position. The Group has adopted the
terminology used in IFRS 15 to describe such balances.

**Notes to the Financial Statements for the Period 4 January 2018 to 31 December 2018 (Continued)**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

The Group’s accounting policies for its revenue streams are disclosed in detail below. Apart from
providing more extensive disclosures on the Group’s revenue transactions, the application of IFRS 15 has
not had a significant impact on the financial position and/or financial performance of the Group. The
amount of adjustment for each financial statement line item affected by the application of IFRS 15 for the
current year is shown in note 4.

Revenue is derived from the provision of sport and leisure facilities in the United Kingdom and Europe.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts
receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and
other sales-related taxes.

The Group’s revenues are recognised mainly from the following goods and services:

- Membership subscriptions

- Administration and joining fees

- Sale of sports lessons including swimming, tennis and personal training

- Other product sales, including food and beverage and cr`eche services

_Membership subscriptions_

Membership subscriptions can be paid annually or monthly by direct debit. Subscriptions are recognised
over the period of membership, with any subscriptions received upfront being recorded as a contract
liability on the statement of financial position.

_Administration and joining fees_

Administration and joining fees are paid upfront and are non-refundable. They represent a fee for the
initial set up costs of the contract and for the right to renew the membership for no additional fee when the
contract expires. Revenue is recognised in line with when the performance obligations are performed
which is over the average membership period, including any period of renewal. Revenue relating to future
periods of membership are recognised as contract liabilities in the statement of financial position.

The average membership periods over which revenue is recognised are:

Standard membership 24 months
Flexible membership 1 month
Annual membership 24 months

_Sale of sports lessons and personal training_

Sports lessons are paid for upfront at the beginning of the term or monthly by direct debit. Revenue is
recognised over the period that lessons are provided, and any upfront payment is recognised as a contract
liability on the statement of financial position.

Personal training paid for monthly by direct debit or on the date they are taken is recognised in the month
they are paid as this is when the performance obligation is satisfied. Alternatively, personal training
vouchers can be purchased up front in packs of three or ten sessions. The period over which this revenue
should be recognised requires judgement. Historical data shows that on average one personal training
session is used each week for a pack purchased up front. Revenue is therefore recognised on this basis.
Revenue received in relation to future periods are recognised as contract liabilites on the statement of
financial position.

_Product sales_

Revenue from food and beverage sales, and other merchandise is recognised at the point of sale.

**Notes to the Financial Statements for the Period 4 January 2018 to 31 December 2018 (Continued)**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**Exceptional items**

Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements, where it is necessary to provide
further understanding of the financial performance of the Group. They are items that are material, either
because of their size or their nature, or that are non-recurring.

**Foreign currency transactions and balances**

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency
of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘‘the functional currency’’). The
consolidated financial statements are presented in pound sterling, which is the Group’s presentation
currency.

Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are recognised at the rates of exchange
prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each statement of financial position date, monetary assets
and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that
date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at
the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured
in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Exchange differences are recognised
in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.

On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated into pounds sterling at rates
approximating to those ruling when the transactions took place. All assets and liabilities of overseas
operations, including goodwill arising on the acquisition of those operations, are translated at the rate
ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on translating the opening net assets at opening
rate and the results of overseas operations at actual rate are recognised in other comprehensive income
and accumulated in the foreign exchange reserve.

The average conversion rate during the period was £1: A1.13 (2017: £1: A1.14), and at the statement of
financial position date was £1: A1.13 (2017: £1: A1.13).

**Borrowing costs**

Costs directly attributable to the refinancing have been capitalised and amortised over the related loan
period. Where fees do not relate directly to a particular loan, they have been apportioned between the
loans based on the total loan principal.

**Tax**

The tax expense for the period comprises current tax and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income
statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or
directly in equity respectively.

The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the
balance sheet date in the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable
income.

Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities
and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are
not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is not accounted for if it
arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that
at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is
determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of
financial position date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the
deferred tax liability is settled.

Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be
available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

F-150

**Deuce Holdco Limited**

**Notes to the Financial Statements for the Period 4 January 2018 to 31 December 2018 (Continued)**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax
assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes
levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities and
there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

**Investments**

Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are held at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Land and buildings held for use in the supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, are
stated in the statement of financial position at their net book value, being the fair value at the date of
acquisition less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
Freehold land is not depreciated. Plant and machinery are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
any recognised impairment loss.

**Depreciation**

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over
their useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:

Fixtures and Fittings—between 3 and 20 years
Freehold Buildings—50 years
Long Leasehold or leasehold interests—over the shorter of 50 years or the remaining lease term

Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as
owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.

The gain or loss arising on the disposal or scrappage of an asset is determined as the difference between
the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit/(loss) on disposal of
PP&E within the income statement.

**Club opening costs**

Site development costs capitalised represent costs incurred in respect of the development of new sites. No
depreciation is charged until the new club is brought into operation.

Costs incurred prior to the date of opening a club which are not directly associated with its acquisition,
construction, refurbishment or fitting out are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.

**Goodwill**

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method or using merger accounting where it
was a common control transaction and the relative rights remained the same before and after the
combination. Under the acquisition method, the cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the
consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling
interest in the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in exceptional
operating expenses.

When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate
classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and
pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.

Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred
over the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in
excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the gain is recognised in profit or loss. Goodwill is
capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

statement of comprehensive income. Goodwill has been allocated to each geographical region based on its
value in use.

After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the
purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date,
allocated to groups of cash-generating units (‘‘CGU’’) that are expected to benefit from the combination,
irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. The Group is
considered to be the smallest relevant CGU for goodwill impairment testing, as this is the level at which
goodwill is monitored internally.

**Intangible assets**

Intangible assets are recognised on business combinations if they are separable from the acquired entity or
give rise to other contractual/legal rights. The amounts ascribed to such intangibles are arrived at by using
appropriate valuation techniques (see note 3, critical estimates and judgements). They are amortised over
their useful lives from the date of acquisition.

The fair value of clubs held under operating leasehold interests at acquisition are carried as intangible
assets. Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease
terms. The fair value of operating lease rents above or below market rate at acquisition are carried as
provisions or intangible assets respectively and amortised on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease
terms.

The estimated value of brand names acquired are recorded as intangible fixed assets with indefinite useful
lives and are therefore tested annually for impairment.

An identifiable internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s Information Technology
development is recognised only to the extent its cost can be reliably measured and future economic
benefits will flow to the Group as a result.

Internally-generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives—usually
3 years.

Computer software and licenses are capitalised at cost, and amortised over their useful life or licence
period, where applicable—1 to 3 years.

**Impairment of tangible and intangible assets**

At each statement of financial position date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and
intangible assets (including goodwill) to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have
suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated
to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that
are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating
unit (‘‘CGU’’) to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for
impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.

Each individual club is considered to be a CGU.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use,
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which
the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the
carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is
recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is increased
to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not

**Deuce Holdco Limited**

**Notes to the Financial Statements for the Period 4 January 2018 to 31 December 2018 (Continued)**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for
the asset (or CGU) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or
loss.

Investments are reviewed for impairment based upon the net assets of subsidiaries adjusted to reflect the
recoverable amounts of their fixed assets.

**Inventories**

Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where
applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the stocks to their
present location and condition. Cost is calculated using the weighted average method. Net realisable value
represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in
marketing, selling and distribution.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly
liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts.

**Creditors**

Creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Creditors are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.

**Trade and other receivables**

Trade and other receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the
ordinary course of business. Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

**Provisions**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a
past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate
can be made of the amount of the obligation.

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the
present obligation at the statement of financial position date, taking into account the risks and
uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to
settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows. The amortisation
of the discount is recognised as interest payable.

Present obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as provisions. An
onerous contract is considered to exist where the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs
of meeting the obligations under the contract or exiting the contract exceed the economic benefits
expected to be received under it.

**Leases**

Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks
and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group and the corresponding liability to
the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.

F-153

**Deuce Holdco Limited**

**Notes to the Financial Statements for the Period 4 January 2018 to 31 December 2018 (Continued)**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Finance expenses are recognised immediately in profit and loss, unless they are directly attributable to
qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Group’s general policy on
borrowing costs.

Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the
relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in
which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.

In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised
as a liability. The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a
straight-line basis, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in
which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.

**Employee benefits**

_Pension obligations_

Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
The assets of the scheme are invested and managed independently of the finances of the Group.

_Senior management incentive plan_

The Group recognised a liability for participants of the Senior Management Incentive Plan within
provisions (note 27), the provision has been utilised during the year.

_Share-based payments_

Employees (including senior executives) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based
payments, whereby employees render services as consideration for the right to purchase equity instruments
in the parent company (equity-settled transactions).

The fair value at start date of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding
increase in the share-based payment reserve in equity, over the period in which the performance and/or
service conditions are fulfilled. The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each
reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the
Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The income statement
expense or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the
beginning and end of that period and is recognised in employee benefits expense.

No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for equity-settled transactions for
which vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition. These are treated as vesting
irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other
performance and/or service conditions are satisfied.

When the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense
had the terms not been modified, if the original terms of the award are met. An additional expense is
recognised for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction,
or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.

When an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any
expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. This includes any award where
non-vesting conditions within the control of either the entity or the employee are not met. However, if a
new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that
it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award,
as described in the previous paragraph.

**Deuce Holdco Limited**

**Notes to the Financial Statements for the Period 4 January 2018 to 31 December 2018 (Continued)**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**Employee Benefit Trust**

The Employee Benefit Trust is considered to be controlled by the Group. The activities of the Trust are
conducted on behalf of the Group according to its specific business needs in order to obtain benefits from
its operation and on this basis, the assets held by the Trust are consolidated into the Group’s financial
statements.

**Financial liabilities**

_Classification_

Financial liabilities can be classified as ‘fair value through profit or loss’ or held at amortised cost. All are
initially recognised at fair value, and in the case of loans, net of any transaction costs. Loans are measured
at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method, with interest expense recognised on an effective
yield basis.

_Recognition and measurement_

The Company derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Company’s obligations are
discharged, cancelled or they expire.

**Financial assets**

_Classification_

From 4 January 2018, the group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:
financial assets at fair value (either through Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) or through profit or loss)
and financial assets at amortised cost.

The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time
of initial recognition. For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will be recorded either in profit or
loss or in OCI.

In the prior year financial assets were classified into the following specified categories: financial assets ‘at
fair value through profit or loss’ (FVTPL), ‘Held to maturity’ (HTM), ‘Available for Sale’ (AFS) and ‘loans
and receivables’.

_Recognition and measurement_

All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of a
financial asset is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the time frame
established by the market concerned.

At initial recognition, the group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial
asset measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, transaction costs that are directly attributable
to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through
profit or loss (FVTPL) are expensed in profit or loss.

Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether
their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest.

_Impairment_

From 4 January 2018, the group assesses, on a forward-looking basis, the expected credit losses associated
with its debt instruments carried at amortised cost and fair value through OCI. Expected credit losses are
measured through a loss allowance at an amount equal to the expected credit losses for the next 12 months
or the expected credit losses over the lifetime of the asset. The impairment methodology applied depends
on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.

**Deuce Holdco Limited**

**Notes to the Financial Statements for the Period 4 January 2018 to 31 December 2018 (Continued)**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

For trade receivables, the group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires
expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables, see note 4 for further
details.

_Derecognition of financial assets_

The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset
expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of
the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards
of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in
the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all
the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the
financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.

**Changes in accounting policies and disclosures**

(a) New standards, amendments and interpretations

The following new standards, amendments and interpretations are newly mandatorily effective for the first
time in the current period:

None of these are expected to have a significant impact on the financial statements of the Group or parent
company, except the following:

**IFRS 16, ‘Leases’**

**_General impact of application of IFRS 16 Leases_**

IFRS 16 provides a comprehensive model for the identification of lease arrangements and their treatment
in the financial statements for both lessors and lessees. IFRS 16 will supersede the current lease guidance
including IAS 17 Leases and the related Interpretations when it becomes effective for accounting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The date of initial application of IFRS 16 for the Group will be
1 January 2019.

The Group has preliminarily chosen the modified retrospective application of IFRS 16 in accordance with
IFRS 16:C5(b) with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognised as an adjustment to
opening balance of retained earnings at 1 January 2019.

In contrast to lessee accounting, IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements
in IAS 17.

**_Impact of the new definition of a lease_**

The change in definition of a lease mainly relates to the concept of control. IFRS 16 distinguishes between
leases and service contracts on the basis of whether the use of an identified asset is controlled by the
customer. Control is considered to exist if the customer has:

- The right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of an identified asset; and

- The right to direct the use of that asset.

The Group will apply the definition of a lease and related guidance set out in IFRS 16 to all lease contracts
entered into or modified on or after 1 January 2019 (whether it is a lessor or a lessee in the lease contract).
In preparation for the first time application of IFRS 16, the Group has carried out an implementation
project. The project has shown that the new definition in IFRS 16 will not change significantly the scope of
contracts that meet the definition of a lease for the Group.

**_Impact on Lessee Accounting Operating leases_**

IFRS 16 will change how the Group accounts for leases previously classified as operating leases under
IAS 17, which were off balance sheet. On initial application of IFRS 16, for all leases (except as noted
below), the Group will:

a) Recognise right of use assets and lease liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position,
initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments;

b) Recognise depreciation of right of use assets and interest on lease liabilities in the consolidated
income statement;

c) Separate the total amount of cash paid into a principal portion (presented within financing activities)
and interest (presented within operating activities) in the consolidated cash flow statement.

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Lease incentives (e.g. rent free period) will be recognised as part of the measurement of the right of use
assets and lease liabilities whereas under IAS 17 they resulted in the recognition of a lease liability
incentive, amortised as a reduction of rental expenses on a straight line basis.

Under IFRS 16, right of use assets will be tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of
Assets. This will replace the previous requirement to recognise a provision for onerous lease contracts.

For short term leases (lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets the Group will opt to
recognise a lease expense on a straight line basis as permitted by IFRS 16.

As at 31 December 2018, the Group has non cancellable operating lease commitments of £2,197m (2017:
£2,247m).

A preliminary assessment indicates that all of these arrangements relate to leases other than short term
leases and leases of low value assets, and hence the Group will recognise a right of use asset of between
£920m to £966m and a corresponding lease liability of between £819m to £861m in respect of all these
leases. The impact on profit or loss is to decrease rent expenses by £70m to £75m, to increase depreciation
by £30m to £35m and to increase interest expense by £45m to £50m. The provision for onerous lease
contracts which was required under IAS 17 of £29.6m will be recognised as an impairment against the right
of use asset, and the non-cash rent accrual of £22.9m will be derecognised. Lease liability incentives of
£3.0m previously recognised in respect of the operating leases will be derecognised and the amount
factored into the measurement of the right of use assets and lease liabilities.

Under IAS 17, all lease payments on operating leases are presented as part of cash flows from operating
activities. The impact of the changes under IFRS 16 would be to reduce the cash generated by operating
activities by £70m to £75m and to increase net cash used in financing activities by the same amount.

**_Finance leases_**

The main differences between IFRS 16 and IAS 17 with respect to assets formerly held under a finance
lease is the measurement of the residual value guarantees provided by the lessee to the lessor. IFRS 16
requires that the Group recognises as part of its lease liability only the amount expected to be payable
under a residual value guarantee, rather than the maximum amount guaranteed as required by IAS 17. On
initial application the Group will present equipment previously included in property, plant and equipment
within the line item for right of use assets and the lease liability, previously presented within finance lease
liabilities, will be presented in a separate line for lease liabilities.

Based on an analysis of the Group’s finance leases as at 31 December 2018 on the basis of the facts and
circumstances that exist at that date, the directors of the Company have assessed that the impact of this
change will not have an impact on the amounts recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial
statements.

**_Impact on Lessor Accounting_**

Under IFRS 16, a lessor continues to classify leases as either finance leases or operating leases and account
for those two types of leases differently. However, IFRS 16 has changed and expanded the disclosures
required, in particular regarding how a lessor manages the risks arising from its residual interest in leased
assets.

Under IFRS 16, an intermediate lessor accounts for the head lease and the sublease as two separate
contracts. The intermediate lessor is required to classify the sublease as a finance or operating lease by
reference to the right of use asset arising from the head lease (and not by reference to the underlying asset
as was the case under IAS 17).

Because of this change the Group will reclassify certain of its sublease agreements as finance leases. As
required by IFRS 9, an allowance for expected credit losses will be recognised on the finance lease
receivables. The leased assets will be derecognised and finance lease asset receivables recognised. This
change in accounting will change the timing of recognition of the related revenue (recognised in finance
income).

**3 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty**

In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the Directors are
required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are
based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may
differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that
period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future
periods.

**Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies**

The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (which are dealt with
separately below), that the Directors have made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies
and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in financial statements.

_Lease commitments_

The Group has entered into commercial property leases as a lessee. The classification of these leases as
operating or finance leases requires the Group to determine, based on an evaluation of the terms and
conditions of the arrangements, whether it obtains all of the significant risks and rewards of ownership of
these properties.

Until 2015 all property leases were accounted for as operating leases. In 2015 the Group entered into a
sale and leaseback transaction for 44 of its properties. It was concluded that the land element of the leases
represented operating leases and the building elements represented finance leases. This analysis required
judgements around the fair values of the land and building elements at the start of the leases and the likely
future change in value of each element over the 125 year period.

_Judgements in determining the timing of satisfaction of performance obligations under IFRS15_

The timing of satisfaction of performance obligations of administration and joining fees for members
requires judgement. Administration and joining fees represent a fee for the initial set up costs of the
contract and for the right to renew the membership for no additional fee when the contract expires. The
set-up costs are critical to the contract with the new member, but they do not satisfy performance
obligations, as no good or service is transferred to the member. The member effectively pays for the future
right of renewing their membership for no additional fee. It is at these renewal dates that the performance
obligation is fulfilled, therefore it is appropriate to release the revenue over the total membership period,
which includes any renewal period. Historical data and trends have been used to determine the average
period of membership and number of renewals for each package type.

In making their judgement, the directors considered the detailed criteria for the recognition of revenue set
out in IFRS 15. Following the detailed review of the Group’s membership base and historic trends, the
directors are satisfied that performance obligations have been satisfied and that recognition of the revenue
in the current year is appropriate.

**Key sources of estimation uncertainty**

The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance
sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.

_Onerous property leases_

Onerous lease provisions are recognised where the present value of rental commitments exceeds the
earnings that the leased premises are expected to be able to generate. A number of significant assumptions

**Deuce Holdco Limited**

**Notes to the Financial Statements for the Period 4 January 2018 to 31 December 2018 (Continued)**

**3 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (Continued)**

and estimates are involved when measuring onerous lease commitments based on the expected future
discounted cashflows attributable to the leased properties or the estimated cost of exiting the leases.
Forecasts of future cashflows are based on management’s best estimates of future revenues and expenses,
historic trends and other information available which is relevant at the date of the financial statements.
The estimated cost of exiting leases is determined with advice from external valuers. Sensitivity to changes
in assumptions are disclosed within note 15.

_Goodwill impairment_

Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually in line with IAS36 by comparing the consolidated carrying
value of goodwill and cash-generating units to the value in use of the cash-generating units within the
Group. The calculation of value in use requires estimation of future cashflows and a discount rate to
determine the present value. Sensitivity to changes in assumptions are disclosed within note 15.

_Club impairments_

The carrying amounts of the Group’s clubs, which are deemed to be individual cash-generating units, are
reviewed at each statement of financial position date to determine whether there is any indication of
impairment, considering value in use calculations based on a discounted cashflow model and realisable
values.

The cash flows are derived from the budget and business plan to 2021 and then extrapolated at a 1.9% rate
per annum. The discount rate is based on the weighted average cost of capital, as determined by
management. Sensitivity to changes in assumptions are disclosed within note 15.

_Future taxation_

Management estimates are required to determine the amount of deferred tax asset that can be recognised,
based upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profits together with an assessment of the effect of
tax planning strategies. In evaluating the Group’s ability to recover its deferred tax assets, the projected
future taxable income and recent financial performance is considered.

Estimation is also required to determine the likely future realisation of properties, whether through use or
sale, which has a material impact on the tax bases used for calculating deferred tax. Management have
determined that leased properties will be consumed over the lives of the lease and the remaining freehold
properties will be ultimately realised through sale.

The net deferred tax liability of £45.6m is sensitive to the future tax rates in the relevant jurisdictions. For
every 1% that the UK tax increases, the net deferred tax liability increases by £3.1m. For every 1% that the
Dutch tax rate decreases, the net deferred tax liability increases by £0.2m.

Contract liabilities arise on joining and administration fees which are paid upfront as part of the member
joining process. Revenue is recognised over the average membership period, including any period of
renewal. Previously, under IAS18, revenue from joining and admin fees were recognised on a cash basis.

**IFRS 9 Financial instruments**

The Company has adopted IFRS 9 Financial instruments from 4 January 2018 which has resulted in
changes in accounting policies and disclosures.

Trade receivables are subject to impairment review under IFRS 9. The company uses the simplified
approach for measuring expected credit losses for all trade receivables and contract assets. The expected
loss rate used is based on the default rates of similar debtors over the prior year to 3 January 2018. This
method of impairment is in line with the prior year accounting treatment of membership debtors. The

Exceptional items are included within other operating expenses in the income statement.

Impairment consists of a net impairment charge of PPE of £98,000 (2017: net reversal of £1,486,000) and
an impairment of intangible assets of £646,000 (2017: net reversal of £247,000).

These items are considered by the directors due to their size and nature to be exceptional and are
therefore separately disclosed.

The tax effect of the exceptional items disclosed above was credit £2,289,000 (2017: debit £775,000) due to
the increase in deferred tax assets as a result of the above items.

Exceptional items listed above generated a net cash outflow of £9,040,000 (2017: £5,900,000).

**Lease intangible fair value uplift:** The fair value of the individual acquired clubs as a business has been
determined through a third party valuation.

Goodwill is considered to represent the value of the assembled workforce and the benefits that will be
generated from combining this site with the existing portfolio of brands and clubs. None of the goodwill
recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

Purchase consideration of £1.8m consisted solely of cash consideration and was funded through existing
reserves of the Group.

The group incurred acquisition-related costs of £0.5m related to external legal and professional fees. These
transaction costs have been charged to exceptional operating costs in the income statement for the period
ended 31 December 2018 and treated as an operating cash flow in the cash flow statement.

Post-acquisition to 31 December 2018 this club has contributed £2.1m in revenue and a loss of (£0.02m) in
EBITDA. If City Green, Geneva had been acquired from 4 January 2018 the club would have contributed
pro-forma revenue of £2.8m and EBITDA loss of (£0.02m).

**Bad Homburg**

On 1 June 2018, a newly incorporated German company, David Lloyd Clubs Deutschland GmbH, for
which David Lloyd Leisure Ltd holds 100% of the share capital, purchased the trade and assets of a health
club from HealthCity Germany GmbH. Total cash consideration of A1.8m (£1.6m) was paid. On the same
date, David Lloyd Clubs Deutschland GmbH entered into a 30 year lease over the land and buildings.

The club has been acquired for the purpose of expanding David Lloyd Clubs (the brand) market share.

On 24 September 2018, DHL made an upstream loan to its parent Deuce Group S.`a.r.l. for the principal
amount of £43.7m, and to TDR funds for a principal amount of £345.0m. The loans were interest bearing
at a rate of 2.55% and interest accrued in the period was £2.3m. The loan with Deuce Group S.`a.r.l. was
settled on 23 November 2018 and the loan with TDR funds was settled on 18 December 2018 by way of
dividends in specie.

During the period a Euro swap was taken out in advance of the repayment of the Euro loan, a loss of
£0.6m on the swap is recognised in finance costs.

During the period £16.3m of loan arrangement fees were written-off to finance costs on repayment of the
existing loans.

The prior year adjustment of £4.0m credit (2017: £2.7m debit) primarily relates to the analysis of the tax
treatment of exceptional items and fixed assets where further information is now available on the nature of
these costs.

**15 Impairment testing**

Club impairments and onerous lease provisions are allocated to individual clubs as these are considered to
be separate CGU’s at which the the group monitors performance.

Goodwill acquired through business combinations and brands with indefinite lives have been allocated to
seperate CGU’s based on the acquisition date on which the goodwill arose, as they are monitored at this
level by the Board.

**Key assumptions used in value in use calculations**

The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow
projections from financial budgets approved by senior management. The pre-tax discount rate applied to
cash flow projections is 11.25% (2017: 9.0%) and cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated
using a 1.9% growth rate (2017: 2.0%). The discount rate has been adjusted to reflect the changes in the
capital structure of the Group and market conditions.

Discount rate—the discount rate calculation is based on the specific circumstances of the Group and is
derived from its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC takes into account both debt and
equity where the cost of equity is derived from the expected return on investment by the Group’s investors
and the cost of debt is based on the interest bearing borrowings the Group is obliged to service.

**Sensitivity to changes in assumptions**

With regard to the assessment of value in use, a change in any of the above key assumptions could have a
material impact on the carrying value of the cash generating unit.

For the purposes of property, plant and equipment impairment reviews, the Group considers each club to
be an individual cash-generating unit (CGU), with each CGU reviewed annually for indicators of
impairment. The Group obtained external valuations of a number of sites and compared these with the
estimated value in use. This was calculated based on projected cash flows to 2021, using a discount factor
of 11.25% (2017: 9.0%). This has resulted in a total impairment charge of £0.1m (2017: £1.5m reversal) to
the carrying value of property, plant & equipment.

Goodwill and brands are not amortised but tested annually for impairment. The brand is considered to
have an indefinite life due to the history and market position of the trade name.

On 1 March 2018, a newly incorporated French company, David Lloyd Clubs France SAS, purchased 100%
of the share capital in LK International Sarl and acquired the trade and assets of City Green Sports &
Health Club from FTL Management Sarl. Goodwill of £291,000, a lease asset below market rent of
£533,000, a leasehold health club intangible of £395,000 and a customer list of £34,000 were recognised on
acquisition.

On 1 June 2018, a newly incorporated German company, David Lloyd Clubs Deutschland GmbH, for
which David Lloyd Leisure Ltd holds 100% of the share capital, purchased the trade and assets of a health
club from HealthCity Germany GmbH. Goodwill of £194,000, a leasehold health club intangible of
£1,097,000 and a customer list of £46,000 were recognised on acquisition.

**24 Financial risk management and impairment of financial assets**

**Group**

In common with all other businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial
instruments. This note describes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks
and the methods used to measure them. Further quantitative information in respect of these risks is
presented throughout these financial statements.

The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group’s risk management objectives and
policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing
and operating processes that ensure the effective implementation of the objectives and policies to the
Group’s finance function. The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far
as possible without unduly affecting the Group’s competitiveness and flexibility. Further details regarding
these policies are set out below:

**Credit risk and impairment**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument
fails to meet its contractual obligations. The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade
debtors. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, which

**24 Financial risk management and impairment of financial assets (Continued)**

is made where there is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows. The credit risk of the
Group is minimised as customers pay by direct debit in advance.

Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions.
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with minimum rating ‘‘A’’ are
accepted. Further disclosures regarding trade and other receivables, which are neither past due nor
impaired, are provided in note 19.

**Market risk**

**Foreign exchange risk**

Foreign exchange risk arises when individual Group entities enter into transactions denominated in a
currency other than their functional currency. The Group’s policy is, where possible, to allow Group
entities to settle liabilities denominated in their functional currency with the cash generated from their own
operations in that currency. Where Group entities have liabilities denominated in a currency other than
their functional currency (and have insufficient reserves of that currency to settle them), cash already
denominated in that currency will, where possible, be transferred from elsewhere within the Group.

The Group had foreign currency exposure on its Euro denominated loan during the period and on its
overseas operations. When consolidated there is a risk of variability in the translation value of those
operations’ net assets. By the period end, the Euro denominated loan had been repaid therefore risk has
been reduced. The Group has no policy to hedge the overseas net investments.

Sensitivity of balance sheet movements in the Euro exchange rate are shown below:

**Interest rate risk**

The Group was sensitive to changes in the interest rate, since its borrowings were at a variable rate related
to LIBOR and EURIBOR during the year. The new Revolving Credit Facilities are subject to variable
rates based on LIBOR, but no funds were drawn down on these facilities by the period end.

_Sensitivity analysis_

The new loan notes have fixed interest rates.The sensitivity of the interest expense on previous bank debt
to movements in LIBOR and EURIBOR is shown below. Interest was calculated based on margin plus
LIBOR/EURIBOR and included a minimum LIBOR/EURIBOR rate of 1%.

**24 Financial risk management and impairment of financial assets (Continued)**

**Commodity price risk**

The Group manages its exposure to electricity and gas price risk by purchasing its utility requirements in
advance through industry leading advisers.

**Capital risk**

Capital risk arises from the management of the capital structure, which consists mainly of the loans and
borrowings detailed in note 24 and shareholder equity. The capital structure should be managed to ensure
the Group can remain a going concern, and to maximise shareholder funds. There are no covenants
associated with the loans and borrowings since they were refinanced on 21 September 2018. Detailed cash
flow forecasts based on expected working capital requirements and expected capital projects are
maintained throughout the year to ensure that the Group has sufficient funds to operate as a going
concern using the available facilities.

**Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital, loan facilities and the finance
charges on its debt instruments. To ensure that the Group always has sufficient cash to meet its liabilities, it
seeks to maintain cash balances (or agreed facilities) to meet expected requirements according to
predicted cash flows.

**Maturity analysis**

**24 Financial risk management and impairment of financial assets (Continued)**

**Financial instruments not measured at fair value**

Financial instruments not measured at fair value includes all of the above.

Due to their short-term nature, the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other
receivables, trade and other payables and finance leases approximates their fair value.

**Fair value measurement**

Any fair value measurement is categorised within the fair value hierarchy:

- Level 1—Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

- Level 2—Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement is directly or indirectly observable; and

- Level 3—Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement is unobservable.

The fair value of the bank borrowings as disclosed in Note 23 was measured using Level 2 techniques. It is
based on national lending rates on similar loans from information released by the Bank of England.

Where the fair valuations are on a recurring basis the Group determines whether transfers have occurred
between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is
significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

There have not been any transfers between levels in the hierarchy for any financial instruments.

**26 Share-based payments**

**Scheme details and movements**

Under the Management Incentive Plan (‘‘MIP’’) senior executives of the Group are entitled to purchase B
ordinary and C ordinary shares. The B and C ordinary shares are entitled to participate in proceeds on a
sale of the Group in accordance with the Articles of the Company. Members of the plan must remain
employees of the Group in order to retain their full entitlement to participate in proceeds. There are no
other vesting conditions. The purchase of shares is part-funded by limited-recourse loans advanced by
Deuce Acquisitions Limited. The intrinsic value (being the difference between the cash paid and the fair
value) at the date of grant is recognised as an equity-settled share based payment and spread on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period.

During the period, the existing B ordinary shares were re-organised into five classes of B ordinary shares
and the existing C ordinary shares were re-organised into five classes of C ordinary shares. Deuce Group
S.a.r.l purchased shares from senior executives at market value and the outstanding loan balances were
repaid.

The expense recognised in employee expenses during the year is a credit of £0.1m (2017: expense of
£0.4m).

a) Legal claims

The provision recognised for a potential legal case relating to a health and safety incident at a club has
been released. In the directors’ opinion after taking appropriate legal advice, the probability that a transfer
of economic benefits will occur is considered remote.

b) Onerous contracts

Onerous lease provisions include health club leases and reflects the estimated minimum net cost of exiting
or fulfilling the lease. The provisions are expected to be released over the life of the operating leases,
which range from 5 to 30 years.

deferred tax assets of £2.1m (2017: £2.0m) in respect of the UK property portfolio, and unrecognised
deferred tax assets of £4.7m (2017: £7.8m) in relation to carried forward losses where it is not sufficiently
