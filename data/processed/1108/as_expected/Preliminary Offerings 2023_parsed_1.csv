We define EBITDA as net income (loss) from continuing operations, excluding the impact of interest expense (net of interest income), income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding stock-based compensation and certain other adjusting items (as described below). EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are measures commonly used in the distribution industry, and we present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to enhance your understanding of our operating performance. An Adjusted EBITDA-based metric is also used in our debt financing covenants. We present net debt to enhance your understanding of our financial position and define net debt as total debt less cash and cash equivalents. We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate financial performance, analyze the underlying trends in our business and establish operational goals and forecasts that are used when allocating resources. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful measures because they permit investors to better understand changes in underlying operating performance over comparative periods by providing investors with financial results that are unaffected by certain items that are not indicative of ongoing operating performance. While we believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors when evaluating our business, they are not prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and therefore should be considered supplemental in nature. You should not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for other financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may have material limitations including, but not limited to, the exclusion of certain costs without a corresponding reduction of net income for the income generated by the assets to which the excluded costs are related. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

Acquisition costs are impacted by the timing and size of the acquisitions. We exclude acquisition costs from our non-GAAP financial measures to provide a useful comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies because such amounts vary significantly based on the magnitude of the acquisition and do not reflect our core operations. - _Restructuring costs. Represent costs stemming from headcount rationalization efforts and certain rebranding costs; impact of divestitures; costs related to changing our fiscal year end; amortization of debt issuance costs; debt refinancing and extinguishment costs; and abandoned lease costs. We exclude restructuring costs from our non-GAAP financial measures, as such items vary significantly based on the magnitude of the restructuring activity and also do not reflect expected future operating expenses.

We present net debt to enhance your understanding of our financial position and define net debt as total debt less cash and cash equivalents. We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate financial performance, analyze the underlying trends in our business and establish operational goals and forecasts that are used when allocating resources. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful measures because they permit investors to better understand changes in underlying operating performance over comparative periods by providing investors with financial results that are unaffected by certain items that are not indicative of ongoing operating performance. While we believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors when evaluating our business, they are not prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and therefore should be considered supplemental in nature. You should not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for other financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may have material limitations including, but not limited to, the exclusion of certain costs without a corresponding reduction of net income for the income generated by the assets to which the excluded costs are related. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

Represent certain direct and incremental costs related to acquisitions, including: amortization of intangible assets; professional fees, branch integration expenses, travel expenses, employee severance and retention costs, and other personnel expenses classified as selling, general and administrative; gains/losses related to changes in fair value of contingent consideration or holdback liabilities; and amortization of debt issuance costs. Acquisition costs are impacted by the timing and size of the acquisitions. We exclude acquisition costs from our non-GAAP financial measures to provide a useful comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies because such amounts vary significantly based on the magnitude of the acquisition and do not reflect our core operations. - _Restructuring costs. Represent costs stemming from headcount rationalization efforts and certain rebranding costs; impact of divestitures; costs related to changing our fiscal year end; amortization of debt issuance costs; debt refinancing and extinguishment costs; and abandoned lease costs. We exclude restructuring costs from our non-GAAP financial measures, as such items vary significantly based on the magnitude of the restructuring activity and also do not reflect expected future operating expenses.

Words such as “aim,” “anticipate,” believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “project,” “should,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” “would” and the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology often identify forward-looking statements. Statements in this offering memorandum and the documents incorporated by reference herein that are not historical facts are hereby identified as “forward-looking statements” for the purpose of the safe harbor provided by Section 21E of the Exchange Act and Section 27A of the Securities Act.

1108_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Our Company,9.1.3,,"We are the largest publicly traded distributor of roofing materials and complementary building products, such as siding and waterproofing, in North America. We have served the building industry for over 90 years and as of as of June 30, 2023, we operated over 500 branches throughout all 50 states in the U.S. and six provinces in Canada. We believe we offer one of the most extensive ranges of high-quality professional grade exterior products comprising over 130,000 SKUs, and we serve nearly 100,000 residential and non-residential customers who trust us to help them save time, work more efficiently and enhance their businesses. We are strategically focused on two core markets, residential and non-residential roofing, as well as complementary building products like siding and waterproofing that are often utilized by the roofing and other specialty contractors we serve. As a distributor, our national scale, networked model, and specialized capabilities are competitive advantages, providing strong value for both customers and suppliers. We intend to grow faster than the market by enhancing our customers’ experience, activating a complete go-to-market strategy, and expanding our footprint organically and through acquisitions while also driving margin-enhancing initiatives. Our differentiated service model is designed to solve customer needs. The scale of our business provides branch coverage, technology enablement, and investment in our team that is the foundation of customer service excellence. In addition, service is further enhanced by our On Time and Complete network (Beacon OTC[®]), market-based sales teams, and national call center. We believe we also provide the most complete digital commerce platform in roofing distribution, creating value for customers who are able to operate their businesses more effectively and efficiently. Based on management’s estimates, we believe the roofing distribution market in the United States and Canada represents more than $30 billion in annual sales with roughly 70% of the market in residential roofing and 30% in non-residential. Additionally, we believe the distribution market for complementary building products, including siding, waterproofing, plywood/oriented strand board (OSB), and windows and doors, represents approximately $24 billion in annual sales with roughly 80% of the market in residential and 20% in non-residential. We believe our position in a collective addressable market of roughly $54 billion provides multiple paths to growth. We believe the majority of roofing demand is driven by re-roofing activity (estimated at 80% of total roofing demand) with the remaining demand tied to new construction. Re-roofing projects are typically related to necessary maintenance and repairs and are therefore less likely to be postponed during periods of recession or slower economic growth. As a result, demand for roofing products historically has been less volatile than overall demand for construction products. Our complementary building products demand comes from both the residential and non-residential sectors. These products allow us to be a supplier of choice to exteriors-focused customers and possess relatively greater end-market exposure to new construction compared to roofing products. 1 ----- 2 ----- the Issuer’s common stock or to sell, transfer, assign, or otherwise dispose of the Shares prior to the Repurchase Date.

Disruptions in our sources of supply may occur as a result of unanticipated demand or production or delivery difficulties. When shortages occur, building material suppliers often allocate products among distributors. Although we believe that our relationships with our suppliers are strong and that we would have access to similar products from competing suppliers should products be unavailable from current sources, any supply shortage, particularly of the most commonly sold items, could result in a loss of revenues and reduced margins and damage relationships with customers. The exterior products industry experienced constrained supply chain dynamics in 2021 and 2022, caused in large part from global disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we experienced, at times, a limited ability to purchase enough product to meet consumer demand, which resulted in lost revenues. Although we do not believe our lost revenues were material, these trends and future product shortages as a result of any market conditions that arise may be so severe as to result in material reductions in revenues.",,as_expected,2023,160,,,,
1108_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Product Supply and Vendor Relations,13.1.2,A change in vendor pricing and demand could adversely affect our income and gross margins.,"Many of the products that we distribute are subject to price changes based upon manufacturers’ raw material costs, energy costs and labor costs as well as other manufacturer pricing decisions. For example, we experienced resource inflation in 2021 and 2022, as a strong recovery in demand following the COVID-19 pandemic created tightness in the market for certain raw materials. This caused our suppliers and us to increase product prices to address higher input costs. By way of further example, as a distributor of residential roofing supplies, our business is sensitive to asphalt prices, which are highly volatile and often linked to oil prices, as oil is a significant input in asphalt production. Shingle prices have been volatile in recent years, partly due to volatility in asphalt prices. Other products we distribute, such as plywood and OSB, have seen substantial recent price volatility, caused in large part from disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting imbalance between supply and demand. Historically, we have generally been able to pass increases in prices on to our customers. Although we often are able to pass on manufacturers’ price increases, our ability to pass on increases in costs and our ability to do so in a timely fashion depends on market conditions. The inability to pass along cost increases or a delay in doing so could result in lower operating margins. In addition, higher prices could impact demand for these products, resulting in lower sales volumes. 16 -----",,as_expected,2023,160,,,,
1108_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Product Supply and Vendor Relations,13.1.3,A change in vendor rebates could adversely affect our income and gross margins.,"The terms on which we purchase products from many of our vendors entitle us to receive a rebate based on the volume of our purchases. These rebates effectively reduce our costs for products. If market conditions change, vendors may adversely change the terms of some or all of these programs. Although these changes would not affect the net recorded costs of product already purchased, they may lower our gross margins on products we sell and therefore the income we realize on such sales in future periods.",,as_expected,2023,160,,,,

For example, the COVID-19 pandemic led to periods of significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption since its onset. Any future quarantines, labor shortages, or other disruptions to us, our suppliers, or our customers due to a public crisis would likely adversely impact our sales and operating results. A prolonged economic downturn may result in reduced cash flows or a reduction to our market capitalization, triggering the potential need to recognize significant non-cash asset impairment charges in our results of operations. It could also result in an adverse impact on the creditworthiness of our customers and the collectability of trade receivables, thereby affecting our liquidity. In addition, order lead times could be extended or delayed, and pricing could increase. Some products or services may become unavailable if the regional spread became significant enough to prevent alternative sourcing. The increase in remote working arrangements for our personnel may result in greater information technology security risks. We are unable to predict the potential future impact that a pandemic, or another such virus or health concern, could have on us if the spread is unable to be contained. COVID-19 did not have any meaningful adverse impact on our financial results in 2022.

We may not be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified management. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key management employees, or our inability to recruit and retain qualified employees, could adversely affect our ability to operate and make it difficult to execute our acquisition and internal growth strategies.

Economic downturns in the regions and markets we serve could result in lower net sales and, since many of our expenses are fixed, lower profitability. Unfavorable changes in demographics, credit markets, consumer confidence, housing affordability, or housing inventory levels and occupancy, or a weakening of the United States economy or of any regional or local economy in which we operate, could adversely affect consumer spending, resulting in decreased demand for our products, and adversely affecting our business.

Seasonal demand fluctuations are expected, such as in quarters ending March 31, when winter construction cycles and cold weather patterns have an adverse impact on new construction and re-roofing activity. The timing of weather patterns (unseasonable temperatures) and severe weather events (hurricanes, hailstorms and protracted rain) may impact our financial results within a given period either positively or negatively, making it difficult to accurately forecast our results of operations.

Our IT systems include third party applications and proprietary applications developed and maintained by us. We rely heavily on information technology both in serving our customers and in our enterprise infrastructure to achieve our objectives. In certain instances, we also rely on the systems of third parties to assist with conducting our business, which includes, among other things, marketing and distributing products, developing new products and services, operating our website, hosting and managing our services, securely storing Data, processing transactions, responding to customer inquiries, and managing inventory and our supply chain. As a result, the secure operation of our systems (including its function of securing Data), and those of third parties upon whom we depend, are critical to the successful operation of our business. Although our IT systems and Data are protected through security measures and business continuity plans, our systems and those of third parties upon whom we depend may be vulnerable to: natural disasters; power outages; telecommunication or utility failures; terrorist acts; breaches due to employee error or malfeasance; disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware; terminations of business relationships by us or third party service providers; and disinformation campaigns, damage or intrusion from a variety of deliberate cyber-attacks carried out by insiders or third parties, which are becoming more sophisticated and include computer viruses, worms, gaining unauthorized access to systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information either directly or through our vendors and customers, denial of service attacks, ransomware, supply chain attacks, data corruption, malicious distribution of inaccurate information or other malicious software programs that may impact such systems and cause operational disruption. For these IT systems and related business processes to operate effectively, we or our service providers must continually maintain and update them. Delays in the maintenance, updates, upgrading, or patching of these systems and related business processes could impair their effectiveness or expose us to security risks. Even with our policies, procedures and programs designed to ensure the integrity of our IT systems and the security of Data, we may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to which we are exposed. In some instances, we may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities, which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. Despite the precautions we take to mitigate the risks of such events, any attack on our IT systems or breach of our Data, or the IT systems and Data of third parties upon whom we depend, could result in, but are not limited to, the following: business disruption, misstated or misappropriated financial data, product shortages and/ or an increase in accounts receivable aging, an adverse impact on our ability to attract and serve customers, delays in the execution of our business plan, theft of our intellectual property or other non-public confidential information and Data, including that of our customers, suppliers, and employees, liability for stolen assets or information, and higher operating costs including increased cybersecurity protection costs. Such events could harm our reputation and have an adverse impact on our financial results, including the impact of related legal, regulatory, and remediation costs. In addition, if any information about our customers, including payment information, were the subject of a successful cybersecurity attack against us, we could be subject to litigation or other claims by the affected customers. Further, regulatory authorities have increased their focus on how companies collect, process, use, store, share, and transmit personal data. New privacy security laws and regulations, including federal and state laws in the U.S. and federal and provincial laws in Canada, pose increasingly complex compliance challenges, which may increase compliance costs, and any failure to comply with data privacy laws and regulations could result in significant sanctions, monetary costs or other harm to us. 19 ----- If we decide to switch providers, develop our own IT systems to replace providers, or implement upgrades or replacements to our own systems, we may be unsuccessful in this development, or we may underestimate the costs and expenses of switching providers or developing and implementing our own systems.

1108_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.7,Risks Related to Capitalization and Capital Structure,13.7.1,An impairment of goodwill and/or other intangible assets could reduce net income.,"Acquisitions frequently result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets. At December 31, 2022, goodwill represented approximately 32% of our total assets. Goodwill is not amortized for financial reporting purposes and is subject to impairment testing at least annually using a fair-value based approach. The identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of our reporting unit. Our accounting for impairment contains uncertainty because management must use judgment in determining appropriate assumptions to be used in the measurement of fair value. We determine the fair values of our reporting unit by using a qualitative approach. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill for impairment in between our annual tests when events or changes in circumstances, including a sustained decline in our market capitalization, indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. We also perform an annual qualitative assessment to evaluate whether evidence exists that would indicate our indefinite-lived intangibles are impaired. In addition, we review for triggering events that could indicate a need for an impairment test for finite-lived intangible assets. Any impairment of goodwill or indefinite- or finite-lived intangibles will reduce net income in the period in which the impairment is recognized.",,as_expected,2023,160,,,,

This could have an adverse impact on our financial condition since we need to borrow funds at times for working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes. Major disruptions in the capital and credit markets could also lead to broader economic downturns, which could result in lower demand for our products and increased incidence of customers’ inability to pay their accounts. The majority of our net sales volume is facilitated through the extension of trade credit to our customers. Additional customer bankruptcies or similar events caused by such broader downturns may result in a higher level of bad debt expense than we have historically experienced.

Even if the Repurchase had occurred on June 30, 2023, the CD&R Stockholder would still have beneficially owned shares of our common stock which represent approximately 23.9%. As a result, the CD&R Stockholder may have the indirect ability to significantly influence our policies and operations. In addition, under the Investment Agreement, the CD&R Stockholder was entitled to appoint up to two directors to our board of directors. Both Nathan K. Sleeper and Philip W. Knisely, partners at CD&R, currently serve as directors for the Issuer, with Mr. Sleeper to resign as a director and Mr. Knisley to remain a director as a result upon the Repurchase. Notwithstanding that all directors are subject to fiduciary duties to us and to applicable law, the interests of such directors may differ from the interests of our other directors or common stockholders as a whole. With such representation on our board of directors, the CD&R Stockholder has influence over the appointment of management and any action requiring the vote of our board of directors, including significant corporate action such as mergers and sales of substantially all of our assets. The directors controlled by the CD&R Stockholder may also be able to influence decisions affecting our capital structure, including decisions to issue additional capital stock and incur additional debt. Further, the CD&R Stockholder and its affiliates are in the business of making or advising on investments in companies, including businesses that may directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business. In addition, the CD&R Stockholder may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its overall equity investment and have a negative impact to our common stockholders as a whole.

As of 21 ----- March 31, 2023, after giving effect to the Repurchase Transactions, we would have had approximately $552.0 million outstanding balance on our asset-based revolving line of credit due in 2026, $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.50% senior secured notes due in 2026 outstanding, $350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.125% senior notes due in 2029 outstanding, and $982.5 million outstanding under our senior secured term loan due in 2028. Our debt levels could have important consequences to us, including: - increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions; - requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow used in operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our liquidity and our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities; - exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates, and corresponding increased interest expense, because future borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities would be at variable rates of interest; - reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, due to the costs and expenses associated with such debt; - making it more difficult to satisfy our obligations under the terms of our indebtedness; - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes; and - limiting our ability to adjust to changing marketplace conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may have less debt. In addition, the debt agreements that currently govern our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Existing Indentures impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including limitations on our ability to, among other things, pay dividends and make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock; make certain investments; incur certain liens; enter into transactions with affiliates; merge or consolidate; enter into agreements that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments to the Issuer; and transfer or sell assets. The New Indenture will have similar restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, we will be limited as to how we conduct our business, and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to capitalize on available business opportunities. Our liquidity at March 31, 2023, after giving effect to the Repurchase Transactions, would have included $723.0 million in net borrowing availability under the 2026 ABL (subject to availability under a borrowing base and after giving effect to approximately $15.7 million of letters of credit which were outstanding as of March 31, 2023) and $74.2 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand. See “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness— Senior Secured Credit Facilities.” We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of liquidity sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium and interest on our indebtedness. In addition to competitive conditions in the industry in which we operate, our financial condition and operating performance are also subject to prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations, which could cause us to default on our debt obligations and impair our liquidity. In the event of a default under any of our indebtedness, the holders of the defaulted debt could elect to declare all the funds borrowed to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, which in turn could result in cross-defaults under our other indebtedness. The lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities could also elect to terminate their commitments thereunder and cease making further loans, and such lenders could institute foreclosure proceedings against their collateral, which could potentially force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. 22 -----",,as_expected,2023,160,,,,

If we or one of the subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the notes becomes the subject of a bankruptcy case or a lawsuit filed by creditors of us or any such guarantor, the issuance of such notes, the guarantees entered into by these guarantors or the grant of the security interests in favor of such notes may be reviewed under the federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws. Under these laws, such notes, a guarantee and/or a grant of security could be voided, or claims in respect of such notes, a guarantee and/or a security interest could be subordinated to other obligations of us or the applicable guarantor if, among other things, we or the applicable guarantor, at the time the indebtedness evidenced by such notes or a guarantee, as applicable, was incurred or a security interest was granted: - received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for issuing the notes, entering into the guarantee or granting the security interest; and - either: - were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of issuing the notes, entering into such guarantee or grant; - were left with inadequate capital to conduct our business; - believed or reasonably should have believed that we would incur debts or contingent liabilities beyond our ability to pay such debts or contingent liabilities as they become due; or - were a defendant in an action for money damages or had a judgment for money damages docketed against us if, in either case, the judgment is unsatisfied after final judgment. 28 ----- The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, however, we, a guarantor or a grantor would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all of its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - we or such guarantor could not pay its debts or contingent liabilities as they become due. We cannot assure you as to what standard a court would use to determine whether or not we or a guarantor would be solvent at the relevant time, or regardless of the standard used, that any guarantee or grant of security would not be subordinated to any guarantor’s or grantor’s other debt. A court might also void the notes, a guarantee or a grant of security, without regard to the above factors, if the court found that we issued such notes or the applicable guarantor entered into the applicable guaranty or security agreements with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud our or their respective creditors. If a court were to void the notes, a guarantee or a grant of security, a holder of such notes would no longer have a claim against us or the applicable guarantor, or, in the case of the security interest, a claim with respect to the related Collateral. In such event, any payment by a guarantor pursuant to its guarantee of such notes or claim on the Collateral securing such notes or a guarantee of such notes could be voided and required to be returned to the applicable guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of other creditors under those circumstances. If a guarantee and/or a security interest were voided as a fraudulent transfer or held unenforceable for any other reason, in all likelihood holders of the notes would be creditors solely of the Issuer and those guarantors whose guarantees and grants of security had not been voided, and holders of the notes would not get the benefit of a security interest in respect of the security interests that had been voided. The notes then would in effect be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of any guarantor whose guarantee was voided and, as a result of such voided security interest, effectively subordinated to obligations with a valid security interest in such Collateral. Sufficient funds to repay such notes may not be available from other sources. Moreover, the invalidation of a guarantee could result in acceleration of such debt. Each guarantee contains a provision intended to limit the guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer. This provision may not be effective to protect the guarantees from being voided under fraudulent transfer law or may reduce or eliminate the guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes the guarantee worthless. For example, in 2009, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of Florida in Official Committee of _Unsecured Creditors of_ _TOUSA, Inc. v. Citicorp N.

No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with this offering, and there is no assurance that the value of the Collateral is equal to our obligations with respect to the notes and other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral would be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time, the timing and the manner of the sale and the availability of buyers. A significant portion of the Collateral is illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value or market, and there can be no assurances that the Collateral will be saleable.

For example, under the Bankruptcy Code, pursuant to the automatic stay imposed upon the bankruptcy filing, a secured creditor is prohibited from repossessing its Collateral from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of Collateral repossessed from such debtor, or from taking other actions to levy against a debtor, without bankruptcy court approval after notice and a hearing. Moreover, the Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use Collateral even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” is undefined in the Bankruptcy Code and may vary according to circumstances (and is within the discretion of the bankruptcy court), but it is intended in general to protect the secured creditor’s interest in the Collateral from diminishing in value during the pendency of the bankruptcy case and may include periodic payments or the granting of additional security, if and at such times as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of the Collateral as a result of the automatic stay or any sale, use or lease of the Collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court could conclude that the secured creditor’s interest in its Collateral is “adequately protected” against any diminution in value during the bankruptcy case without the need for providing any additional adequate protection, including if the court determines the value of the Collateral exceeds the principal outstanding under the notes. Due to the imposition of the automatic stay, the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict (i) how long payments under such notes could be delayed, or, if made at all, following commencement of a bankruptcy case, (ii) whether or when the controlling collateral agent could repossess or dispose of the Collateral or (iii) whether or to what extent holders of the notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral through the requirement of “adequate protection.” Furthermore, any future pledge of Collateral or guarantee in favor of the collateral agent for its benefit, or for the benefit of the trustee and the holders of the notes, might be voidable in a bankruptcy case of the relevant pledgor or guarantor if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including if the pledgor or guarantor is insolvent at the time of the pledge or guarantee; the pledge or guarantee enables the holders of the notes to receive more than they would if the pledge or guarantee had not been made and the debtor were liquidated under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code; and a bankruptcy case in respect of the pledgor or guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge or guarantee (or within one year following the pledge or guarantee if the creditor that benefited therefrom is an insider under the Bankruptcy Code), any of which could result in a material adverse effect on the ability of the collateral agent or the holders of notes to realize value from the Collateral.",,as_expected,2023,160,,,,

In addition, the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent any Collateral securing our obligations under the 2028 Term Loan is released to satisfy the lien on claims in connection with such foreclosure, the liens on such Collateral securing the notes will also automatically be released without any further action. The holders of the notes will also waive certain of their rights relating to such Collateral in connection with bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings involving the Issuer or any guarantor. The Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the holders of the notes may not take any actions to direct foreclosures or take other remedial actions for at least 180 days following an event of default under the 2028 Term Loan or the notes and an indefinite period if the Term Loan Collateral Agent or administrative agent for the lenders under the 2028 Term Loan, as applicable authorized representative, takes action to direct foreclosures or other actions following such event of default or if an insolvency proceeding is pending. See “Description of Notes—Collateral—Intercreditor Agreements.” After the discharge of the obligations with respect to the 2028 Term Loan, whether on enforcement or repayment, or if the authorized representative of the 2028 Term Loan lenders fails to take adequate action following an event of default, at which time the parties to the 2028 Term Loan will no longer have the right to direct the actions of the Term Loan Collateral Agent with respect to the Collateral pursuant to the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, the right to direct the actions of the applicable collateral agent will pass to the authorized representative of holders of the next largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by 34 ----- liens on the Non-ABL Priority Collateral that are equal in priority to the liens securing the notes and the guarantees. If at that time we have an outstanding series of equal-priority secured indebtedness with a principal amount greater than the outstanding principal amount of the notes, then the authorized representative for such series of equal-priority secured indebtedness would be next in line to direct the applicable collateral agent to exercise rights under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, rather than the trustee for the notes. In addition, subject to certain conditions, the security documents applicable to the notes will generally allow us and our subsidiaries to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral.

In September 2019, Beacon Sales Acquisition, Inc., a guarantor, entered into two interest rate swap arrangements with an affiliate of Wells Fargo Securities, LLC. The swap agreements are for three- and five-year terms and each hedge against $250.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the 2028 Term Loan. The swaps are “pay-fixed/receive-floating” instruments with fixed rates of 1.499% and 1.489% for the three- and five-year swaps, respectively. The threeyear swap expired on August 30, 2022 and swapped the thirty-day LIBOR with a fixed-rate of 1.50%. On March 16, 2023, the Issuer novated its five-year swap agreement to another counterparty and, in connection with such novation, amended the interest rate swap agreement. The amendment changed the index rate from LIBOR to SOFR, increased the total notional amount of the interest rate swap to $500.0 million, and extended the termination date to March 31, 2027. Specifically, the fixed rate of 1.49% indexed to LIBOR was modified to 3.00% indexed to SOFR. At the Issuer’s election, the interest rate per annum applicable to loans issued under the 2026 ABL is based on a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to (i) in the case of revolving loans in U.S. dollars, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (x) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, (y) the SOFR rate applicable for an interest period of one month, plus 1.00% per annum and (z) the “prime rate” announced by the administrative agent (or certain alternative “prime rates”), in each case, plus an applicable margin or (b) an adjusted SOFR rate determined by reference to the higher of (x) SOFR and (y) 0%, in each case, plus an applicable margin and (ii) in the case of revolving loans in Canadian dollars, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (x) the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (“CDOR”) applicable for an interest period of one month, plus 1.00% per annum and (y) the “prime rate” for Canadian dollar commercial loans made in Canada as reported by Thomson Reuters (or any successor or other commercially applicable service or source (including the Canadian Dollar “prime rate” announced by a Schedule I bank under the Bank Act (Canada)) as the administrative agent may designate from time to time) or (b) the Canadian BA rate which is (x) for any lender that is a Canadian Reference Bank, the CDOR, and (y) for any other lender, the CDOR, plus 0.10%, in each case, plus an applicable margin.

On or after the Issue Date, the Issuer, the other Grantors and the Collateral Agent will enter into, amend, supplement or otherwise modify one or more other Notes Collateral Documents which will further provide for certain of the security interests that will secure the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees, unless delayed as described below. These security interests, once established, will secure the payment and performance when due of all of the Obligations of the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors in respect of the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees and in the future may secure other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, in each case as provided in the Notes Collateral Documents. The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to complete or cause to be completed on or prior to the Issue Date all filings and other similar actions required on its part in connection with the creation, perfection, protection and/or reaffirmation of such security interests; provided, however, that the Issuer will have up to 120 days following the Issue Date (or such longer period as the Collateral Agent may agree to) to complete or cause to be completed those actions required to execute and deliver control agreements (or amendments to existing control agreements) with respect to any Deposit Account that is not a Specified Deposit Account or any Securities Account that is not Specified Investment Property, in each case to secure the Obligations in respect of the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees.

The Holders may only act by instruction to the Trustee, which shall instruct the Collateral Agent.

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreements, including the intercreditor provisions described below, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the provisions of the Notes Collateral Documents: (i) all of the rights of the Grantors to exercise voting, corporate and other rights pertaining to all Capital Stock included in the Collateral shall cease, and all such rights will become vested in the Collateral Agent, which, to the extent permitted by law, shall have the sole right to exercise such voting, corporate and other rights and powers; and (ii) the Collateral Agent may take possession of and sell the Collateral or any part thereof in accordance with the terms of applicable law and the Notes Collateral Documents.

In addition, the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent will be restricted from contesting any enforcement action or proceeding (or forbearance thereof) pursued by the ABL Agent with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral.

In the event a bankruptcy proceeding shall be commenced by or against the Issuer or any other Grantor and the Applicable Priority Agent shall desire to permit the Issuer or any other Grantor to use cash collateral which constitutes ABL Priority Collateral or Non-ABL Priority Collateral, as applicable, or to enter into certain debtor-in-possession financings (a “DIP Financing”) in such proceeding, the Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral or Non-ABL Priority Collateral, as applicable, may, without any further action or consent by the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent (in the case of ABL Priority Collateral) or the ABL Agent (in the case of Non-ABL Priority Collateral), be made junior and subordinated to Liens granted to secure such DIP Financings (such Liens, “DIP Financing Liens”), to any adequate protection provided to the ABL Facility Secured Parties or Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties, as applicable, and to any “carve-out” or similar administrative priority expense or claim consented to in writing by the ABL Agent (in the case of ABL Priority Collateral) or the Term Loan Agent, 2026 Secured Notes Collateral Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable (in the case of Non-ABL Priority Collateral), to be paid prior to the Discharge of ABL Facility Obligations or Discharge of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, as applicable, subject to certain conditions. Under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, (x) each of the Term Loan Agent and the Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself and the applicable other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties, will not contest, or support any other Person in contesting (i) any request by the ABL Agent or any of the other ABL Facility Secured Parties for adequate protection with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral or any adequate protection provided to the ABL Agent or any of the other ABL Facility Secured Parties with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral or (ii) any objection by the ABL Agent or any of the other ABL Facility Secured Parties to any motion, relief, action or proceeding based on a claim of a lack of adequate protection with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral; and (y) the ABL Agent will not contest, or support any other Person in contesting (i) any request by the Term Loan Agent, 2026 Secured Notes Collateral Agent, Collateral Agent or any of the other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties for adequate protection with respect to the Non-ABL Priority Collateral or any adequate protection provided to the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent or any of the other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties with respect to the Non-ABL Priority Collateral or (ii) any objection by the Term Loan Agent, 2026 Secured Notes Collateral Agent, Collateral Agent or any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party to any motion, relief, action or proceeding based on a claim of a lack of adequate protection with respect to the Non-ABL Priority Collateral. Under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, the Term Loan Agent, 2026 Secured Notes Collateral Agent and Collateral Agent will only be permitted to seek adequate protection with respect to its security interests in ABL 61 ----- Priority Collateral without the prior written consent of the ABL Facility Secured Parties in limited circumstances. For example, if any or all of the ABL Facility Secured Parties are granted adequate protection in the form of additional collateral or a super-priority claim in connection with the use of cash collateral which constitutes ABL Priority Collateral or a DIP Financing or in connection with any Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral and such additional collateral is the type of asset or property that would constitute ABL Priority Collateral, then (A) each of the Term Loan Agent, 2026 Secured Notes Collateral Agent and the Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself or any of the applicable Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties, may seek or request adequate protection in the form of a Lien or super-priority claim on such additional collateral, which Lien or claim will be subordinated to the Liens securing the ABL Facility Obligations and such use of cash collateral constituting ABL Priority Collateral or DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto) on the same basis as the other Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral securing the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations are so subordinated to the Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral securing the ABL Facility Obligations under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement. The ABL Agent will be similarly limited in its ability to seek adequate protection with respect to its security interests in the Non-ABL Priority Collateral without the prior written consent of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will also limit the right of the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent and the other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties to seek relief from or modification of the “automatic stay” in respect of the ABL Priority Collateral. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent may not assert any right of marshalling, appraisal, valuation or other similar right that may be available under applicable law with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral. Until the Discharge of ABL Facility Obligations has occurred, in the event of any bankruptcy or liquidation proceeding, the Designated Term Loan/ Notes Agent and the other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties will not be permitted to object or oppose (or support any Person in objecting or opposing) a motion with respect to any sale, lease, license, exchange, transfer or other disposition of any ABL Priority Collateral free and clear of the Liens of the Designated Term Loan/ Notes Agent and the other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties or other claims under Section 363 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”), or any comparable provision of any bankruptcy law and shall be deemed to have consented to any such sale, lease, license, exchange, transfer or other disposition of any ABL Priority Collateral under Section 363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code that has been consented to by the ABL Agent; provided, that the proceeds of such sale, lease, license, exchange, transfer or other disposition of any ABL Priority Collateral shall be applied to the ABL Facility Obligations or the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations in accordance with the provisions governing the application of proceeds in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement or, if not so applied, the Liens of the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent or ABL Agent, as applicable, shall attach to the proceeds of such disposition subject to the relative priorities set forth in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will also limit the right of the ABL Agent and the other ABL Facility Secured Parties to seek relief from or modification of the “automatic stay” in respect of the Non-ABL Priority Collateral. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides that the ABL Agent may not assert any right of marshalling, appraisal, valuation or other similar right that may be available under applicable law with respect to the Non-ABL Priority Collateral. Until the Discharge of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations has occurred, in the event of any bankruptcy or liquidation proceeding, the ABL Agent and the other ABL Facility Secured Parties will not be permitted to object or oppose (or support any Person in objecting or opposing) a motion with respect to any sale, lease, license, exchange, transfer or other disposition of any Non-ABL Priority Collateral free and clear of the Liens of the ABL Agent and the other ABL Facility Secured Parties or other claims under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, or any comparable provision of any bankruptcy law and shall be deemed to have consented to any such sale, lease, license, exchange, transfer or other disposition of any Non-ABL Priority Collateral under Section 363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code that has been consented to by the Designated Term Loan/ Notes Agent; provided, that the proceeds of such sale, lease, license, exchange, transfer or other disposition of any Non-ABL Priority Collateral shall be applied to the ABL Facility Obligations or the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations in accordance with the provisions governing the application of proceeds in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement or, if not so applied, the Liens of the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent or ABL Agent, as applicable, shall attach to the proceeds of such disposition subject to the relative priorities set forth in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement. 62 ----- Under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, each of the Term Loan Agent, 2026 Secured Notes Collateral Agent and Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the other applicable Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties, waives any claim any such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party may hereafter have against any ABL Facility Secured Party arising out of the election by any ABL Facility Secured Party of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, or any comparable provision of any other bankruptcy law, with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral. The ABL Agent, for itself and on behalf of the ABL Facility Secured Parties with respect to which the ABL Agent is acting as agent, will make a corresponding waiver with respect to any claim the ABL Facility Secured Parties may have had arising out of any such election by any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party with respect to the Non-ABL Priority Collateral. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will also provide that neither the ABL Agent nor any other ABL Facility Secured Party will oppose or seek to challenge any claim by the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent or any other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party for allowance in any Insolvency Proceeding of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations consisting of Post-Petition Interest to the extent of the value of any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party’s Lien. In addition, neither the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent nor any other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party will oppose or seek to challenge any claim by the ABL Agent or any other ABL Facility Secured Party for allowance in any Insolvency Proceeding of ABL Facility Obligations consisting of Post-Petition Interest to the extent of the value of any ABL Facility Secured Party’s Lien. Under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, on or after the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the Senior ABL Agreement and the acceleration of all ABL Facility Obligations, including the commencement of an Insolvency Proceeding as to the Grantors that constitute such event of default (each a “Non-ABL Loan/Notes Purchase Event”), one or more of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties will have the option, for a period of ten Business Days after the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Purchase Event, to purchase all (but not less than all) of the ABL Facility Obligations from the ABL Facility Secured Parties. Any such purchasing Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties will be required on the date of purchase to (i) pay to the ABL Agent for the account of the ABL Facility Secured Parties as the purchase price therefor, the full amount of all ABL Facility Obligations then outstanding and unpaid (including principal at par and interest) and (ii) furnish cash collateral to the ABL Agent in such amounts as are required by the Senior ABL Agreement in connection with any issued and outstanding letters of credit, banker’s acceptances or similar or related instruments (but not in any event in an amount greater than one hundred five percent (105%) of the aggregate undrawn face amount of such letters of credit, banker’s acceptances and similar or related instruments). The ABL Facility Secured Parties will have a corresponding purchase option in respect of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations. Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement The rights and obligations of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement described below will be subject to the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement to the extent applicable. Generally, “Shared Collateral” means, at any time, Collateral in which the holders of two or more classes of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations (or their authorized Representatives) hold a valid and perfected security interest. Under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders of the Notes will be represented by the Trustee, the Term Loan Secured Parties will be represented by the Term Loan Agent, the 2026 Secured Notes Secured Parties will be represented by the 2026 Secured Notes Trustee and the holders of each class of Additional Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations will be represented by their respective Representative(s). The Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the priorities and other relative rights among the Holders and the holders of other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations (including the Term Loan Secured Parties and 2026 Secured Notes Secured Parties), including, among other things, that: (1) notwithstanding the date, time, method, manner or order of grant, attachment or perfection of any Liens on the Shared Collateral securing any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, the Liens securing all such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations shall be of equal priority; and 63 ----- (2) any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations may be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended or modified from time to time, in each case, to the extent permitted by the Indenture, the Senior Term Agreement, the 2026 Secured Notes Indenture and any other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Debt Documents, without affecting the relative priority with respect to other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations or the relative rights under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. The Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will also provide that only the “Applicable Authorized Representative” has the right to direct foreclosures and take other actions with respect to the Shared Collateral and that none of the other holders of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations or representatives in respect thereof will have any right to direct foreclosures or take such other actions. The Term Loan Agent will be the Applicable Authorized Representative until the earlier of (i) the date that all Obligations in respect of the Senior Term Agreement are no longer secured by the Shared Collateral and (ii) the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date (such earlier date, the “Applicable Authorized Agent Date”). At all times following the Applicable Authorized Agent Date, the Applicable Authorized Representative will be the Representative of the series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations (other than the Term Loan Obligations) that at such time constitutes the largest outstanding principal amount of any then-outstanding series of Non-ABL Loan/ Notes Obligations. The “Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date” is the date that is 180 days (throughout which 180-day period the Representative that is to replace the Applicable Authorized Representative was the Representative of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations that constitute the largest outstanding principal amount of any then-outstanding series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations (other than the Term Loan Obligations) (the “Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative”)) after the occurrence of both (a) an event of default under the terms of that class of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations and (b) the Trustee’s and each other Representative’s receipt of written notice from that Representative certifying that (i) such Representative is the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative and that an event of default with respect to such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations has occurred and is continuing and (ii) such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of the agreement governing those Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations; provided, however, that the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be stayed and shall not occur and shall be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Shared Collateral (1) at any time the Applicable Collateral Agent or the Applicable Authorized Representative has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to such Shared Collateral or (2) at any time the Issuer or any other Grantor that has granted a security interest in such Shared Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. “Applicable Collateral Agent” means (i) prior to the Applicable Authorized Agent Date, the Term Loan Agent, (ii) following the Applicable Authorized Agent Date, at any time the Trustee is the Applicable Authorized Representative, the Collateral Agent and (iii) following the Applicable Authorized Agent Date, at any time the Trustee is not the Applicable Authorized Representative, the collateral agent designated by the Applicable Authorized Representative. The Applicable Authorized Representative under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will have the sole right to instruct the Applicable Collateral Agent to act or refrain from acting with respect to the Shared Collateral, and the Applicable Collateral Agent will not follow any instructions with respect to such Shared Collateral from any other Person. No Representative of any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations or other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party (other than the Applicable Authorized Representative) will be entitled to instruct the Applicable Collateral Agent to commence any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its security interests in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, the Shared Collateral. 64 ----- Subject to the foregoing, notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens, the Applicable Collateral Agent, acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative, may deal with the Shared Collateral as if such Applicable Collateral Agent had a senior Lien on such Shared Collateral. No Representative of any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations or Non-Controlling Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party (other than the Applicable Authorized Representative) may contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Applicable Authorized Representative, a Controlling Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party or the Applicable Collateral Agent (acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative). The Trustee and each other Representative will agree that it will not accept any Lien on any Collateral for the benefit of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties (other than funds deposited for the discharge or defeasance of any Non-ABL Loan/ Notes Obligation or cash collateral in connection with a letter of credit or in connection with the obligations of a defaulting lender) other than pursuant to the Collateral Documents. Each holder of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, including the Holders by acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have agreed that it will not contest or support any other Person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any other holder of such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations in all or any part of the Collateral, or any of the provisions of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. If an event of default has occurred and is continuing under any documentation evidencing or governing any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations and the Applicable Collateral Agent or any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Shared Collateral, any distribution is made with respect to any Shared Collateral in any bankruptcy case of the Issuer or any Grantor and any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party receives any payment pursuant to any Intercreditor Agreement (other than the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Shared Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Collateral by the Applicable Collateral Agent or any other holder of such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations and proceeds of any such distribution, as applicable, will be applied among the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations to the payment in full of such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations on a ratable basis, after payment of all amounts owing to the Applicable Collateral Agent and the other Representatives, in their capacities as such. None of the holders of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations may institute any suit or assert in any suit, bankruptcy, insolvency or other proceeding any claim against the Applicable Collateral Agent or any other holder of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Collateral. In addition, none of the holders of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations may seek to have any Shared Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. None of the Applicable Collateral Agent, any Applicable Authorized Representative or any other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Applicable Collateral Agent, such Applicable Authorized Representative or other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party with respect to any Shared Collateral in accordance with the provisions of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. If any holder of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations obtains possession of any Shared Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof, in each case, as a result of the enforcement of remedies, at any time prior to the discharge of each of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, then it must hold such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other holders of Non-ABL Loan/ Notes Obligations and promptly transfer such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Applicable Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the Collateral Documents. If, at any time the Applicable Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Shared Collateral, then (whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of each series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released and discharged; provided that any proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom shall be allocated and applied pursuant to and in accordance with the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. The Applicable Collateral Agent and each Representative will agree to execute and deliver (at the sole cost and expense of the Grantors) all such authorizations and other instruments as shall reasonably be requested by the Applicable 65 ----- Authorized Representative to evidence and confirm any release of Shared Collateral provided for in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. If the Issuer or any Grantor becomes subject to any bankruptcy case, the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement provides that if the Issuer or any Grantor, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of DIP Financing to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties agree that they will not object to any such financing or to the DIP Financing Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the same or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Shared Collateral, unless the Applicable Authorized Representative opposes or objects to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or such use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Shared Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party will subordinate its Liens with respect to such Shared Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any such Shared Collateral granted to secure the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations of the Controlling Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to such Shared Collateral as set forth in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement), in each case so long as: (A) each series of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties retain the benefit of their Liens on all such Shared Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-a-vis all the other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of the bankruptcy case; (B) each series of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties are granted Liens on any additional collateral pledged to any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, with the same priority vis-a-vis the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties as set forth in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement; (C) if any amount of such DIP Financing or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to and in accordance with the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement; and (D) if any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection are applied pursuant to and in accordance with the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement; provided that each series of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties will have a right to object to the grant of a Lien to secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties of such series or its Representative that do not constitute Shared Collateral; and provided, however, that the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties receiving adequate protection shall not object to any other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties in connection with a DIP Financing or use of cash collateral. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holders of each series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations (and not the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties of any other series) will bear the risk of (i) any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (x) any of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations of such series are unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other than another series of Non-ABL Loan/ Notes Obligations), (y) any of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations of such series do not have an enforceable security interest in any of the Collateral securing any other series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations and/or (z) any intervening security interest that may exist securing other obligations (other than another series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the security interest of such series of Non-ABL 66 ----- Loan/Notes Obligations but junior to the security interest of any other series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, (ii) all or any portion of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations of such series constituting Excess Obligations and (iii) the existence of any Collateral for any other series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations that is not Shared Collateral (any such condition referred to in the foregoing clause (i), (ii) or (iii) with respect to any series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, an “Impairment” of such series). In the event of any Impairment with respect to any series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, the results of such Impairment will be borne solely by the holders of such series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations (including the right to receive distributions in respect of such series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations pursuant to the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement) set forth in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will be modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the series of such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations subject to such Impairment. Accordingly, with respect to any Shared Collateral for which a third party (other than a Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party) has a lien or security interest that is junior in priority to the security interest of any series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations but senior (as determined by appropriate legal proceedings in the case of any dispute) to the security interest of any other series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations (such third party, an “Intervening Creditor”), the value of any Shared Collateral or proceeds which are allocated to such Intervening Creditor shall be deducted on a ratable basis solely from the proceeds distributed in respect of the series of such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations subject to such impairment from the Shared Collateral. Additionally, in the event the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations of any series are modified pursuant to applicable law (including pursuant to Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code), any reference to such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations or the Collateral Documents governing such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations will refer to such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations or such documents as so modified.",,as_expected,2023,160,,,,
1108_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,238,DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS,238.16,Collateral,238.16.6,Certain Limitations on the Collateral,"No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer or any other Grantor in connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes. The value of the Collateral in the event of liquidation will depend on many factors. Consequently, liquidating the Collateral may not produce proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due on the Notes. Proceeds from the sale of certain Collateral will be required to be applied to repay obligations secured by a prior ranking lien on such Collateral before any funds will be available to satisfy claims with respect to the Notes or the other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations. See “Risk Factors— Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—The Collateral may not be valuable enough to satisfy all the obligations secured by such Collateral and, in certain circumstances, can be released without the consent of the trustee or the holders of the notes.” The fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on a number of factors, including, among others, prevailing interest rates, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers and similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral will be dependent on numerous factors, including the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time, the timing and the manner of the sale and the availability of buyers. By its nature, some of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value or market. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, we cannot assure you that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral that remain after any required repayment of obligations with a prior ranking lien will be sufficient to pay the Issuer’s and each other Grantor’s Obligations in respect of the Notes, the Subsidiary Guarantees and the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by Holders from the sale of Collateral securing the Notes and the Obligations in respect of the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s and each other Grantor’s other unsecured senior debt and other unsubordinated obligations, including trade payables. To the extent that third parties establish Liens on the Collateral, such third parties could have rights and remedies with respect to the assets subject to such Liens that, if exercised, could adversely affect the value of the Collateral or the ability of the Collateral Agent or the Holders to realize or foreclose on the Collateral. The Issuer may also issue Additional Notes after the Issue Date as described above or otherwise incur Obligations which would be secured by the 67 ----- Collateral, the effect of which would be to increase the amount of Indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The ability of the Holders to realize on the Collateral may also be subject to certain bankruptcy law limitations in the event of a bankruptcy. See “—Collateral—Certain Bankruptcy Limitations.”",,as_expected,2023,160,,,,
1108_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,238,DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS,238.16,Collateral,238.16.7,Certain Bankruptcy Limitations,"In addition to the limitations described above, the right of a Priority Agent, including the Collateral Agent, as applicable, to obtain possession, exercise control over or dispose of the Collateral following an Event of Default is likely to be significantly impaired by applicable bankruptcy law if the Issuer or any other Grantor were to have become a debtor under the Bankruptcy Code prior to such Priority Agent having obtained possession, exercised control over or disposed of the Collateral. Upon the commencement of a case for relief under the Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor is prohibited by the automatic stay from obtaining possession of its collateral from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from exercising control over or disposing of collateral taken from such debtor, without bankruptcy court approval. Moreover, the Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor in certain circumstances to continue to retain and to use collateral owned as of the date of the bankruptcy filing (and the proceeds, products, offspring, rents or profits of such collateral) even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments; provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The term “adequate protection” is not defined in the Bankruptcy Code, but it can include making periodic cash payments, providing an additional or replacement Lien or granting other relief, in each case to the extent that the collateral decreases in value during the pendency of the bankruptcy case as a result of, among other things, the imposition of the automatic stay, the use, sale or lease of such collateral or any grant of a “priming lien” in connection with DIP Financing. The type of adequate protection provided to a secured creditor will vary according to the circumstances. In view of the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict whether or when the Collateral Agent could repossess or dispose of the Collateral, or whether or to what extent Holders would be compensated for any delay in payment or decrease in value of the Collateral through the requirement of “adequate protection.” In addition, as described under “—Collateral—Intercreditor Agreements,” pursuant to the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, Holders and the Collateral Agent are restricted on the type of adequate protection provided to such Holders and the Collateral Agent. Furthermore, in the event a bankruptcy court determines the value of the Collateral (after giving effect to any prior or pari passu Liens) is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the Holders would hold secured claims only to the extent of the value of the Collateral (after giving effect to any prior or pari passu Liens) and would hold unsecured claims with respect to any shortfall. Under the Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor’s claim includes Post-Petition Interest, costs or charges provided for under the agreement under which such claim arose only if and to the extent the claims are oversecured. In addition, if the Issuer or any other Grantor were to become the subject of a bankruptcy case, the bankruptcy court, among other things, may void certain prepetition transfers made by the entity that is the subject of the bankruptcy filing, including, without limitation, transfers held to be preferences or fraudulent conveyances. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Federal and state statutes may allow courts, under specific circumstances, to void the notes, the guarantees or the security interests, subordinate claims in respect of the notes, the guarantees or the security interests and/or require noteholders to return payments received from us or the guarantors.” In the event the Issuer or any other Grantor becomes a debtor in a bankruptcy case, the Issuer or such other Grantor may enter into DIP Financing in such case. As a result of such DIP Financing, the Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees may, without any further action or consent by the Trustee, the Collateral Agent or the Holders, be made junior and subordinated to such DIP Financing Liens so long as the Issuer or the applicable other Grantor can show that (i) it could not obtain credit otherwise and (ii) there is adequate protection of the interest of the holder of the Lien on the assets on which such priming Lien is proposed to be granted. In addition, as described under “—Collateral—Intercreditor Agreements,” pursuant to the 68 ----- Intercreditor Agreements, Holders will not be permitted to object to certain DIP Financings and may be required to subordinate their Liens in connection with certain DIP Financings.

1108_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,238,DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS,238.17,"We do not intend to qualify the Indenture under the TIA and, therefore, the Issuer will not need to comply with TIA Section 313(b), relating to reports, and TIA Section 314(d), relating to the release of property or securities or relating to the substitution therefor of any property or securities to be subjected to the Lien of the Notes Collateral Documents. Change of Control",238.17.1,,"Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below), unless the Issuer has prior to or substantially concurrent with the time the Issuer is required to make a Change of Control Offer (as defined below) pursuant to the third paragraph of this covenant delivered a redemption notice with respect to all of the outstanding Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption”, each Holder of Notes will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part of such Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101.0% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), in accordance with the terms contemplated by the third paragraph of this covenant. The term “Change of Control” means the occurrence of any of the following: (i) any “person” or “group” (as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) becomes the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50.0% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of Beacon; or (ii) Beacon merges or consolidates with or into, or sells or transfers (in one or a series of related transactions) all or substantially all of the assets of Beacon and its Restricted Subsidiaries to, another Person and any “person” or “group” (as defined in clause (i) above) is or becomes the “beneficial owner” (as so defined), directly or indirectly, of more than 50.0% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the surviving Person in such merger or consolidation, or the transferee Person in such sale or transfer of assets, as the case may be. Unless the Issuer has prior to or substantially concurrent with the time the Issuer is required to make a Change of Control Offer pursuant to this paragraph delivered a redemption notice with respect to all of the outstanding Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Issuer shall, not later than 30 days following the date the Issuer obtains actual knowledge of any Change of Control having occurred, mail or otherwise deliver in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC a notice (a “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder with a copy to the Trustee stating: (1) that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has, or upon such occurrence will have, the right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101.0% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); (2) the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed or otherwise delivered); (3) the instructions determined by the Issuer, consistent with this covenant, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and (4) if such notice is mailed or otherwise delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, that such offer is conditioned on the occurrence of such Change of Control. No Note will be repurchased in part if less than the Minimum Denomination in principal amount of such Note would be left outstanding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, the Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. The Change of Control provisions described above may deter certain mergers, tender offers and other takeover attempts involving Beacon by increasing the capital required to effectuate such transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement that if fully performed would result in a Change of Control is in effect at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. 70 ----- If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Company, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Company as described in the second preceding paragraph, repurchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Company or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice; provided that such notice is given not more than 30 days following such repurchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such repurchase at a price in cash equal to 101.0% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Redemption Date. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this covenant by virtue of its compliance with such securities laws or regulations. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between Beacon and the initial purchasers. Beacon has no present plans to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that Beacon could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, Beacon could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect Beacon’s capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on the ability of Beacon to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions can only be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The occurrence of a Change of Control would constitute a default under each Senior Credit Agreement. Agreements governing Indebtedness of the Company may contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased or repaid upon a Change of Control. Each Senior Credit Agreement prohibits, and agreements governing Indebtedness of the Company Incurred after the Issue Date may also prohibit, the Company from repurchasing the Notes upon a Change of Control unless such Indebtedness has been repurchased or repaid (or an offer made to effect such repurchase or repayment has been made and the Indebtedness of the holders of such Indebtedness accepting such offer has been repurchased or repaid) and/or other specified requirements have been met. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Company to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such agreements, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Company and its Subsidiaries. If the Company experiences a Change of Control that triggers a default under such agreements, the Company could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance such Indebtedness. In the event the Company does not obtain such a waiver or does not refinance such Indebtedness, such default could result in such Indebtedness being declared due and payable. Finally, the Company’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Company’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—We may not be able to finance a change of control offer required by the New Indenture or the Existing Indentures.” The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes. As described above under “—Optional Redemption,” the Company also has the right to redeem the Notes at specified prices, in whole or in part, upon a Change of Control or otherwise. The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the sale or other transfer of “all or substantially all” of the assets of Beacon and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Although there is a developing body of 71 ----- case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of Beacon and its Restricted Subsidiaries and therefore it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether the Holders of the Notes have the right to require the Company to repurchase such Notes.",,as_expected,2023,160,,,,

If on any date subsequent to a date on which any covenants have been suspended pursuant to the first paragraph under “—Suspension of Covenants” one or more of the Rating Agencies downgrade the ratings assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating resulting in the Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Rating from at least two of the three Rating Agencies, all of the Suspended Covenants will be reinstated as of and from the date of such rating decline (any such date, a “Reversion Date”), subject to the Company obtaining the requisite ratings set forth in the first paragraph above under “—Suspension of Covenants” at a subsequent date. The period of time between the suspension of covenants pursuant to the first paragraph under “—Suspension of Covenants” and the Reversion Date is referred to as the “Suspension Period”. Upon such reinstatement, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been Incurred under the exception provided by clause (b)(iii) of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Indebtedness.” With respect to Restricted Payments made after any such reinstatement, the amount of Restricted Payments will be calculated as if the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period. For purposes of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock,” on a Reversion Date the amount of Net Available Cash not applied in accordance with such covenant will be deemed to be reset to zero. In addition, for purposes of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates,” all agreements and arrangements entered into by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary with an Affiliate of the Company during the Suspension Period prior to such Reversion Date will be deemed to have been entered into on or prior to the Issue Date, and for purposes of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restrictions and Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries,” all contracts entered into during the Suspension Period prior to such Reversion Date that contain any of the encumbrances or restrictions subject to such covenant will be deemed to have been existing on the Issue Date. 72 ----- During the Suspension Period, any reference in the definitions of “Permitted Liens” and “Unrestricted Subsidiary” to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or any provision thereof shall be construed as if such covenant were in effect during the Suspension Period. Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated, no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred as a result of any actions taken by the Company or any Subsidiary (including for the avoidance of doubt any failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants) or other events that occurred during any Suspension Period (or upon termination of the Suspension Period or after that time arising out of events that occurred or actions taken during the Suspension Period) and the Company and any Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default or breach of any kind under the Indenture, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations entered into during a Suspension Period following a Reversion Date and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Rating.

(xiii) payments by the Company pursuant to the CD&R Preferred Stock Repurchase Agreement; and (xiv) the declaration and payment of additional Restricted Payments; provided that both before and after giving pro forma effect to any such Restricted Payment and the incurrence of any Indebtedness in connection therewith, the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio is less than or equal to 4.00:1.00. provided that (A) in the case of clauses (ii), (v), (vi) and (xiv), the net amount of any such Permitted Payment shall be included in subsequent calculations of the amount of Restricted Payments, (B) in the case of clause (iv), at the time of any calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments, the net amount of Permitted Payments that have then actually been made under clause (iv) that is in excess of 50.0% of the total amount of Permitted Payments then permitted under clause (iv) shall be included in such calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments, (C) in all cases other than pursuant to clauses (A) and (B) of this proviso, the net amount of any such Permitted Payment shall be excluded in subsequent calculations of the amount of Restricted Payments, and (D) solely with respect to clauses (v), (xiii) and (xiv), no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of any such Permitted Payment after giving effect thereto.

provided that for purposes of this clause (2), if a Person other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary is the successor company with respect thereto, any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed, as the case may be, by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, when such Person becomes such successor company; (3) pursuant to an agreement or instrument (a “Refinancing Agreement”) effecting a refinancing of Indebtedness Incurred or outstanding pursuant or relating to, or that otherwise extends, renews, refunds, modifies or replaces, any agreement or instrument referred to in clauses (1) or (2) of this covenant or this clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or that is, or is contained in, any amendment, supplement or other modification to an Initial Agreement or Refinancing Agreement (an “Amendment”); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such Refinancing Agreement or Amendment taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders of the Notes than encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such Refinancing Agreement or Amendment relates (as determined in good faith by the Company); (4) (A) pursuant to any agreement or instrument that restricts in a customary manner the assignment or transfer thereof, or the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or asset subject thereto, (B) by virtue of any transfer of, agreement to transfer, option or right with respect to, or Lien on, any property or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture, (C) contained in mortgages, pledges or other security agreements securing Indebtedness or other obligations of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary to the extent restricting the transfer of the property or assets subject thereto, (D) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, (E) pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations that impose encumbrances or restrictions on the property or assets so acquired, (F) on cash or other deposits, net worth or inventory imposed by customers or suppliers under agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business, (G) pursuant to customary provisions contained in agreements and instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business (including leases and licenses) in joint venture and other similar agreements or in shareholder, partnership, limited liability company and other similar agreements in respect of non-wholly owned Restricted Subsidiaries, (H) that arises or is agreed to in the ordinary course of business and does not detract from the value of property or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in any manner material to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, (I) pursuant to Hedging Obligations or Bank Products Obligations, (J) customary net worth provisions contained in real property leases entered into by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, so long as the Company has determined in good faith that such net worth provisions could not reasonably be expected to impair the ability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries to meet their ongoing obligations and (K) pursuant to any agreement providing for the subordination of Subordinated Obligations pursuant to the definition thereof;

Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock. The Indenture will provide as follows: (a) The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, make any Asset Disposition unless: (i) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary receives consideration (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at the time of such Asset Disposition at least equal to the fair market value of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition, as such fair market value may be determined (and shall be determined, to the extent such Asset Disposition or any series of related Asset Dispositions involves aggregate consideration in excess of the greater of $50 million and 1.0% of Consolidated Total Assets) in good faith by the Company, whose determination shall be conclusive (including as to the value of all non-cash consideration), such determination being made on the date of contractual agreement to such Asset Disposition; (ii) in the case of any Asset Disposition (or series of related Asset Dispositions) having a fair market value of $50 million or more, at least 75.0% of the consideration therefor (excluding, in the case of an Asset Disposition (or series of related Asset Dispositions), any consideration by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, that are not Indebtedness) received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash; and (iii) an amount equal to 100.0% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied by the Company (or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) as follows: (A) first, either (x) to the extent the Company elects (or is required by the terms of any Senior-Priority Obligations (including Credit Facility Indebtedness), any Senior Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor or any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor), to prepay, repay or purchase any such Indebtedness or (in the case of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments) cash collateralize any such Indebtedness (in each case other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) within 365 days after the later of the date of such Asset Disposition and the date of receipt of such Net Available Cash, provided that in addition to the foregoing, the Net Available 81 ----- Cash from an Asset Disposition of Collateral may not be applied to prepay or repay or purchase any Indebtedness other than Senior-Priority Obligations, or (y) to the extent the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary with an amount equal to Net Available Cash received by the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary) within 365 days from the later of the date of such Asset Disposition and the date of receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided that the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will be deemed to have complied with the provisions described in subclause (y) of this paragraph if and to the extent that, within 365 days after the later of the Asset Disposition that generated such Net Available Cash and the date of receipt of such Net Available Cash, the Company has entered into a binding agreement to invest in such Additional Assets with the good faith expectation that such Net Available Cash will be applied to satisfy such provisions (an “Acceptable Commitment”), and that investment is thereafter completed within 180 days after the end of such 365-day period, or in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Net Available Cash is applied in connection therewith, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary has entered into another Acceptable Commitment (a “Second Commitment”) within 180 days of such cancellation or termination and such Net Available Cash is actually applied in such manner within 180 days from the date of the Second Commitment, it being understood that if a Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Available Cash is applied, then such Net Available Cash shall constitute Excess Proceeds (as defined below); (B) second, to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with clause (A) above (such balance, the “Excess Proceeds”), to make an offer to purchase Notes and (to the extent the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, or is required by the terms thereof) to purchase, redeem, prepay or repay any other Senior-Priority Obligations and any other Senior Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (provided that the Excess Proceeds from an Asset Disposition of Collateral may only be applied to purchase, redeem, prepay or repay any Senior Indebtedness other than Senior-Priority Obligations after all such Senior-Priority Obligations have been paid in full), pursuant and subject to the conditions of the Indenture and the agreements governing such other Indebtedness; and (C) third, to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with clauses (A) and (B) above, to fund (to the extent consistent with any other applicable provision of the Indenture) any general corporate purpose (including the repurchase, repayment or other acquisition or retirement of any Subordinated Obligations); provided, however, that in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to clauses (A)(x) or (B) above, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the related loan commitment (if any) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased; provided further, however, that pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with clauses (A) or (B) above, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary may temporarily invest such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture; and (iv) if such Asset Disposition involves the disposition of Collateral, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary has complied with the applicable provisions of the Indenture and the Notes Collateral Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this covenant, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries shall not be required to apply any Net Available Cash or equivalent amount in accordance with this covenant except to the extent that the aggregate Net Available Cash from all Asset Dispositions or equivalent amount that is not applied in accordance with this covenant exceeds $25 million. Subject in all respects to the requirements of clause (iii)(B) of paragraph (a) of this covenant, if the aggregate principal amount of Notes and/or other Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary validly tendered and not withdrawn (or otherwise 82 ----- subject to purchase, redemption or repayment) in connection with an offer pursuant to and in accordance with clause (iii)(B) of paragraph (a) of this covenant exceeds the Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds will be apportioned between such Notes and such other Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, with the portion of the Excess Proceeds payable in respect of such Notes to equal the lesser of (x) the Excess Proceeds amount multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the outstanding principal amount of such Notes and the denominator of which is the sum of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes and the outstanding principal amount of the relevant other Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, and (y) the aggregate principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn. For the purposes of clause (ii) of paragraph (a) of this covenant, the following are deemed to be cash: (1) Temporary Cash Investments and Cash Equivalents; (2) the assumption of Indebtedness of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock of the Company) or any Restricted Subsidiary and the release of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on payment of the principal amount of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; (3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of the principal amount of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; (4) securities received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition; (5) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; (6) Additional Assets; and (7) any Designated Noncash Consideration received by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in an Asset Disposition having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated Noncash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (7), not to exceed an aggregate amount at any time outstanding equal to the greater of $175 million and 2.5% of Consolidated Total Assets (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Noncash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value). (b) In the event of an Asset Disposition that requires the purchase of Notes pursuant to and in accordance with clause (iii)(B) of paragraph (a) of this covenant, the Company will be required to purchase Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to an offer by the Company for the Notes (the “Offer”) at a purchase price of 100.0% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of purchase in accordance with the procedures (including prorating in the event of oversubscription) set forth in the Indenture. If the aggregate purchase price of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer is less than the Net Available Cash allotted to the purchase of Notes, the remaining Net Available Cash will be available to the Company for use in accordance with clause (iii)(B) of paragraph (a) of this covenant (to repay other Senior Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) or clause (iii)(C) of paragraph (a) of this covenant, and the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. The Company will not be required to make an Offer for Notes pursuant to this covenant if the Net Available Cash available therefor (after application of the proceeds as provided in clause (iii)(A) of paragraph (a) of this covenant) is less than $50 million for any particular Asset Disposition (which lesser amounts shall be carried forward for purposes of determining whether an Offer is required with respect to the Net Available Cash from any subsequent Asset Disposition), and the Company will commence such Offer within 20 days after such Net Available Cash equals or exceeds $50 million. No Note will be purchased in part if less than the Minimum Denomination in principal amount of such Note would be left outstanding. (c) The Company will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the purchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this covenant, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this covenant by virtue of its compliance with such securities laws or regulations. Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates. The Indenture will provide as follows: 83 ----- (a) The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Company (an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate consideration in excess of $15 million unless (i) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction are not materially less favorable to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained at the time in a transaction with a Person who is not an Affiliate of the Company and (ii) if such Affiliate Transaction involves aggregate consideration in excess of $75 million, the terms of such Affiliate Transaction have been approved by a majority of the Board of Directors. Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in this paragraph (a) if (x) such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors or (y) in the event there are no Disinterested Directors, a fairness opinion is provided by a nationally recognized appraisal or investment banking firm with respect to such Affiliate Transaction. (b) The provisions of the preceding paragraph (a) will not apply to: (i) any Restricted Payment Transaction; (ii) (1) the entering into, maintaining or performance of any employment or consulting contract, collective bargaining agreement, benefit plan, program or arrangement, related trust agreement or any other similar arrangement for or with any current or former employee, officer, director, manager or consultant of or to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary heretofore or hereafter entered into in the ordinary course of business, including vacation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or other similar plans, programs or arrangements, (2) payments, compensation, performance of indemnification or contribution obligations, the making or cancellation of loans in the ordinary course of business to any such employees, officers, directors, managers or consultants, (3) any issuance, grant or award of stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, to any such employees, officers, directors, managers or consultants, (4) the payment of reasonable fees to directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as determined in good faith by the Company or such Subsidiary) or (5) Management Advances and payments in respect thereof (or in reimbursement of any expenses referred to in the definition of such term); (iii) any transaction between or among any of the Company, one or more Restricted Subsidiaries or one or more Special Purpose Entities; (iv) any transaction arising out of agreements or instruments in existence on the Issue Date, as such agreements or instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended or renewed from time to time (provided that any such amendment, modification, supplement, extension or renewal taken as a whole is not materially less favorable to the Holders of the Notes than the terms of such agreement or instrument in existence on the Issue Date (as determined in good faith by the Company)), and any payments made pursuant thereto; (v) any transaction in the ordinary course of business on terms that are fair to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or senior management of the Company, or are not materially less favorable to the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that could be obtained at the time in a transaction with a Person who is not an Affiliate of the Company; (vi) any transaction in the ordinary course of business, or approved by a majority of the Board of Directors, between the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Company controlled by the Company that is a joint venture or similar entity; (vii) the performance of the CD&R Preferred Stock Repurchase Agreement; (viii) the performance of the CD&R Investment Agreement and the CD&R Registration Rights Agreement; and 84 ----- (ix) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company or any capital contribution to the Company. Limitation on Liens. The Indenture will provide that the Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create or permit to exist any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) on any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of any other Person), whether owned on the Issue Date or thereafter acquired, securing any Indebtedness (the “Initial Lien”), other than in the case of any Initial Lien on any asset or property not constituting or required to become Collateral, such Initial Lien if contemporaneously therewith effective provision is made to secure the Indebtedness due under the Indenture and the Notes or, in respect of Liens on any Restricted Subsidiary’s property or assets, any Subsidiary Guarantee of such Restricted Subsidiary, equally and ratably with (or on a senior basis to, in the case of Subordinated Obligations) such obligation for so long as such obligation is so secured by such Initial Lien. Any such Lien thereby created in favor of the Notes or any such Subsidiary Guarantee pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates, (ii) in the case of any such Lien in favor of any such Subsidiary Guarantee, upon the termination and discharge of such Subsidiary Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or (iii) any sale, exchange or transfer (other than a transfer constituting a transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor that is governed by the provisions of the covenant described under “—Merger and Consolidation”) to any Person not an Affiliate of the Company of the property or assets secured by such Initial Lien, or of all of the Capital Stock held by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in, or all or substantially all the assets of, any Restricted Subsidiary creating such Initial Lien, in each case, which release and discharge in the case of any sale of such asset or property shall not affect any Lien that the Collateral Agent, Trustee or any other authorized representative may have on the proceeds from such sale.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or, subject to the second paragraph under “—Concerning the Trustee”, that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability; provided, however, that the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification or security by the Holders satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and is known to the Trustee, subject to the following sentence, the Trustee will mail or otherwise deliver to each Holder in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC notice of the Default within 90 days after it occurs.

In addition, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether, to the best knowledge of the signer, the Company is in Default.

Notes sold in the secondary market to institutional accredited investors, as described under “Notice to Investors”, will be represented by an institutional accredited investor global note. Upon issuance, each of the global notes will be deposited with the Trustee as custodian for DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. Ownership of beneficial interests in each global note will be limited to Persons who have accounts with DTC, which we refer to as DTC participants, or Persons who hold beneficial interests through DTC participants. We expect that under procedures established by DTC: - upon deposit of each global note with DTC’s custodian, DTC will credit portions of the principal amount of the global note to the accounts of the DTC participants designated by the initial purchasers of the Notes; and - ownership of beneficial interests in each global note will be shown on, and transfer of ownership of those interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to interests of DTC participants) and the records of DTC participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in the global note). Beneficial interests in the Regulation S global notes will initially be credited within DTC to Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking S.A. (“Clearstream”), on behalf of the owners of these interests. Investors may hold their interests in the Regulation S global notes directly through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in those systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in those systems. Investors may also hold their interests in the Regulation S global notes through organizations other than Euroclear or Clearstream that are DTC participants. 129 ----- Each of Euroclear and Clearstream will appoint a DTC participant to act as its depositary for the interests in the Regulation S global note that are held within DTC for the account of each settlement system on behalf of its participants. Beneficial interests in the global notes may not be exchanged for notes in physical, certificated form except in the limited circumstances described below. Each global note and beneficial interests in each global note will be subject to restrictions on transfer as described under “Notice to Investors.” These restrictions on transfer will apply from the Issue Date until the date that is one year, in the case of Rule 144A notes, or 40 days, in the case of Regulation S notes, after the later of the Issue Date and the last date on which we or any of our affiliates were the owner of the Notes or any predecessor of the Notes (such period being the “Resale Restriction Period”), and will not apply after the Resale Restriction Period ends.",,as_expected,2023,160,,,,

Depending on whether the transfer is being made during or after the Resale Restriction Period, and to which global note the transfer is being made, the Trustee may require the seller to provide certain written certifications in the form provided in the Indenture.

1108_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,238,DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS,238.32,Book-Entry; Delivery and Form,238.32.3,Book-Entry Procedures for the Global Notes,"All interests in the global notes will be subject to the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Company, the Trustee or the initial purchasers of the Notes are responsible for those operations or procedures. DTC has advised us that it is: - a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York; - a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York State Banking Law; - a member of the Federal Reserve System; - a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code; and - a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between its participants through electronic book-entry changes to the accounts of its participants. DTC’s participants include securities brokers and dealers, including the initial purchasers of the Notes, banks and trust companies, clearing corporations and other organizations. Indirect access to DTC’s system is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies; these indirect participants clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC participant, either directly or indirectly. Investors who are not DTC participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through DTC participants or indirect participants in DTC. 130 ----- So long as DTC’s nominee is the registered owner of a global note, that nominee will be considered the sole owner or holder of the Notes represented by that global note for all purposes under the Indenture. Except as provided below, owners of beneficial interests in a global note: - will not be entitled to have Notes represented by the global note registered in their names; - will not receive or be entitled to receive physical, certificated notes; and - will not be considered the owners or holders of the Notes under the Indenture for any purpose, including with respect to the giving of any direction, instruction or approval to the Trustee. As a result, each investor who owns a beneficial interest in a global note must rely on the procedures of DTC to exercise any rights of a holder of Notes under the Indenture (and, if the investor is not a participant or an indirect participant in DTC, on the procedures of the DTC participant through which the investor owns its interest). Payments of principal, premium (if any) and interest with respect to the Notes represented by a global note will be made by the paying agent to DTC’s nominee as the registered holder of the global note. Neither we nor the Trustee will have any responsibility or liability for the payment of amounts to owners of beneficial interests in a global note, for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of those interests by DTC, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records of DTC relating to those interests. Payments by participants and indirect participants in DTC to the owners of beneficial interests in a global note will be governed by standing instructions and customary industry practice and will be the responsibility of those participants or indirect participants and DTC. Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected under DTC’s procedures and will be settled in same-day funds. Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way under the rules and operating procedures of those systems. Cross market transfers between DTC participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected within DTC through the DTC participants that are acting as depositaries for Euroclear and Clearstream. To deliver or receive an interest in a global note held in a Euroclear or Clearstream account, an investor must send transfer instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, under the rules and procedures of that system and within the established deadlines of that system. If the transaction meets its settlement requirements, Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will send instructions to its DTC depositary to take action to effect final settlement by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant global notes in DTC, and making or receiving payment under normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the DTC depositaries that are acting for Euroclear or Clearstream. Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant that purchases an interest in a global note from a DTC participant will be credited on the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream immediately following the DTC settlement date. Cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream from the sale of an interest in a global note to a DTC participant will be received with value on the DTC settlement date but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following the DTC settlement date. DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the above procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the global notes among participants in those settlement systems. However, the settlement systems are not obligated to perform these procedures and may discontinue or change these procedures at any time. Neither we nor the Trustee will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations. 131 -----",,as_expected,2023,160,,,,

Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility of payment of such additional amounts does not result in the notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under applicable Treasury regulations. This position will be based in part on our determination that, as of the initial issuance date of the notes, the possibility that such additional amounts will have to be paid, in the aggregate, is a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of applicable Treasury regulations. Our determination that these contingencies are, in the aggregate, remote or incidental is binding on a holder, unless such holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which it acquires the notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above, then the notes may be treated as contingent payment debt instruments and a holder subject to U.S. federal income taxation may be required to accrue interest income on the notes at a rate in excess of the stated interest based upon a comparable yield. The “comparable yield” is the yield at which we would issue a fixed rate debt instrument with no contingent payments, but with terms and conditions similar to those of the notes. In addition, any gain on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the notes would be recharacterized as ordinary income. Holders of notes should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments.",,as_expected,2023,160,,,,

The initial purchasers have advised us that they currently intend to make a market in the notes. However, they are not obligated to do so and may discontinue any market-making activities at any time without any notice. The ability of the initial purchasers to make a market in the notes may be impacted by changes in any regulatory requirements (including as a result of regulatory developments such as the SEC’s interpretation of Rule 15c2-11 and its application to debt securities) applicable to the marketing, holding and trading of, and issuing quotations with respect to, the notes.

You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp taxes and other charges in connection with purchases of securities. In connection with the offering of the notes, the initial purchasers may engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the initial purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Overallotments, stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may cause the price of the notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If the initial purchasers engage in overallotment, stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions, they may discontinue them at any time without notice. Neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transaction described above may have on the price of the notes.

Certain of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates that we have a lending relationship with routinely hedge, and certain other of those initial purchasers or their respective affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes offered hereby. In addition, from time to time, the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may effect transactions for their own accounts or the accounts of customers, and hold on behalf of themselves or their customers, long or short positions in our debt or equity securities or loans, and may do so in the future. In the ordinary course of their 144 ----- various business activities, the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and securities activities may involve our securities and/or instruments or those of our subsidiaries. The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. It is expected that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about, 2023, which is the business day following the date hereof (such settlement cycle being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will settle in T+, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding business days should consult their own advisors.",,as_expected,2023,160,,,,
