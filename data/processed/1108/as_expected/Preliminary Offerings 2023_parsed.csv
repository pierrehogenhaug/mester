1108,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,271,NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES,271.1,,271.1.1,,"We have included and incorporated by reference certain financial measures in this offering memorandum that have not been prepared in a manner that complies with GAAP, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and net debt. We define EBITDA as net income (loss) from continuing operations, excluding the impact of interest expense (net of interest income), income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding stock-based compensation and certain other adjusting items (as described below). EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are measures commonly used in the distribution industry, and we present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to enhance your understanding of our operating performance. An Adjusted EBITDA-based metric is also used in our debt financing covenants. We present net debt to enhance your understanding of our financial position and define net debt as total debt less cash and cash equivalents. We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate financial performance, analyze the underlying trends in our business and establish operational goals and forecasts that are used when allocating resources. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful measures because they permit investors to better understand changes in underlying operating performance over comparative periods by providing investors with financial results that are unaffected by certain items that are not indicative of ongoing operating performance. While we believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors when evaluating our business, they are not prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and therefore should be considered supplemental in nature. You should not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for other financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may have material limitations including, but not limited to, the exclusion of certain costs without a corresponding reduction of net income for the income generated by the assets to which the excluded costs are related. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

Acquisition costs are impacted by the timing and size of the acquisitions. We exclude acquisition costs from our non-GAAP financial measures to provide a useful comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies because such amounts vary significantly based on the magnitude of the acquisition and do not reflect our core operations. - _Restructuring costs. Represent costs stemming from headcount rationalization efforts and certain rebranding costs; impact of divestitures; costs related to changing our fiscal year end; amortization of debt issuance costs; debt refinancing and extinguishment costs; and abandoned lease costs. We exclude restructuring costs from our non-GAAP financial measures, as such items vary significantly based on the magnitude of the restructuring activity and also do not reflect expected future operating expenses. Additionally, these costs do not necessarily provide meaningful insight into the current or past core operations of our business. - _COVID-19 impacts.

We define EBITDA as net income (loss) from continuing operations, excluding the impact of interest expense (net of interest income), income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding stock-based compensation and certain other adjusting items (as described below). EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are measures commonly used in the distribution industry, and we present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to enhance your understanding of our operating performance. An Adjusted EBITDA-based metric is also used in our debt financing covenants. We present net debt to enhance your understanding of our financial position and define net debt as total debt less cash and cash equivalents. We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate financial performance, analyze the underlying trends in our business and establish operational goals and forecasts that are used when allocating resources. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful measures because they permit investors to better understand changes in underlying operating performance over comparative periods by providing investors with financial results that are unaffected by certain items that are not indicative of ongoing operating performance. While we believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors when evaluating our business, they are not prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and therefore should be considered supplemental in nature. You should not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for other financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may have material limitations including, but not limited to, the exclusion of certain costs without a corresponding reduction of net income for the income generated by the assets to which the excluded costs are related. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Please see note (2) to \u201cSummary\u2014Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information\u201d for a discussion of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, including reconciliations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss). iv ----- The impact of the following expense (income) items is excluded from EBITDA in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA (the \u201cadjusting items\u201d): - _Acquisition costs. Represent certain direct and incremental costs related to acquisitions, including: amortization of intangible assets; professional fees, branch integration expenses, travel expenses, employee severance and retention costs, and other personnel expenses classified as selling, general and administrative; gains/losses related to changes in fair value of contingent consideration or holdback liabilities; and amortization of debt issuance costs. Acquisition costs are impacted by the timing and size of the acquisitions. We exclude acquisition costs from our non-GAAP financial measures to provide a useful comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies because such amounts vary significantly based on the magnitude of the acquisition and do not reflect our core operations. - _Restructuring costs. Represent costs stemming from headcount rationalization efforts and certain rebranding costs; impact of divestitures; costs related to changing our fiscal year end; amortization of debt issuance costs; debt refinancing and extinguishment costs; and abandoned lease costs. We exclude restructuring costs from our non-GAAP financial measures, as such items vary significantly based on the magnitude of the restructuring activity and also do not reflect expected future operating expenses. Additionally, these costs do not necessarily provide meaningful insight into the current or past core operations of our business. - _COVID-19 impacts. Represent costs directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning January 1, 2023, the Issuer determined COVID-19 impacts should no longer be considered an adjusting item.

1108,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Our Company,9.1.3,,"We are the largest publicly traded distributor of roofing materials and complementary building products, such as siding and waterproofing, in North America. We have served the building industry for over 90 years and as of as of June 30, 2023, we operated over 500 branches throughout all 50 states in the U.S. and six provinces in Canada. We believe we offer one of the most extensive ranges of high-quality professional grade exterior products comprising over 130,000 SKUs, and we serve nearly 100,000 residential and non-residential customers who trust us to help them save time, work more efficiently and enhance their businesses. We are strategically focused on two core markets, residential and non-residential roofing, as well as complementary building products like siding and waterproofing that are often utilized by the roofing and other specialty contractors we serve. As a distributor, our national scale, networked model, and specialized capabilities are competitive advantages, providing strong value for both customers and suppliers. We intend to grow faster than the market by enhancing our customers’ experience, activating a complete go-to-market strategy, and expanding our footprint organically and through acquisitions while also driving margin-enhancing initiatives. Our differentiated service model is designed to solve customer needs. The scale of our business provides branch coverage, technology enablement, and investment in our team that is the foundation of customer service excellence. In addition, service is further enhanced by our On Time and Complete network (Beacon OTC[®]), market-based sales teams, and national call center. We believe we also provide the most complete digital commerce platform in roofing distribution, creating value for customers who are able to operate their businesses more effectively and efficiently. Based on management’s estimates, we believe the roofing distribution market in the United States and Canada represents more than $30 billion in annual sales with roughly 70% of the market in residential roofing and 30% in non-residential. Additionally, we believe the distribution market for complementary building products, including siding, waterproofing, plywood/oriented strand board (OSB), and windows and doors, represents approximately $24 billion in annual sales with roughly 80% of the market in residential and 20% in non-residential. We believe our position in a collective addressable market of roughly $54 billion provides multiple paths to growth. We believe the majority of roofing demand is driven by re-roofing activity (estimated at 80% of total roofing demand) with the remaining demand tied to new construction. Re-roofing projects are typically related to necessary maintenance and repairs and are therefore less likely to be postponed during periods of recession or slower economic growth. As a result, demand for roofing products historically has been less volatile than overall demand for construction products. Our complementary building products demand comes from both the residential and non-residential sectors. These products allow us to be a supplier of choice to exteriors-focused customers and possess relatively greater end-market exposure to new construction compared to roofing products. 1 ----- 2 ----- the Issuer’s common stock or to sell, transfer, assign, or otherwise dispose of the Shares prior to the Repurchase Date.

Although we do not believe our lost revenues were material, these trends and future product shortages as a result of any market conditions that arise may be so severe as to result in material reductions in revenues.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

Our IT systems include third party applications and proprietary applications developed and maintained by us. We rely heavily on information technology both in serving our customers and in our enterprise infrastructure to achieve our objectives. In certain instances, we also rely on the systems of third parties to assist with conducting our business, which includes, among other things, marketing and distributing products, developing new products and services, operating our website, hosting and managing our services, securely storing Data, processing transactions, responding to customer inquiries, and managing inventory and our supply chain. As a result, the secure operation of our systems (including its function of securing Data), and those of third parties upon whom we depend, are critical to the successful operation of our business. Although our IT systems and Data are protected through security measures and business continuity plans, our systems and those of third parties upon whom we depend may be vulnerable to: natural disasters; power outages; telecommunication or utility failures; terrorist acts; breaches due to employee error or malfeasance; disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware; terminations of business relationships by us or third party service providers; and disinformation campaigns, damage or intrusion from a variety of deliberate cyber-attacks carried out by insiders or third parties, which are becoming more sophisticated and include computer viruses, worms, gaining unauthorized access to systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information either directly or through our vendors and customers, denial of service attacks, ransomware, supply chain attacks, data corruption, malicious distribution of inaccurate information or other malicious software programs that may impact such systems and cause operational disruption. For these IT systems and related business processes to operate effectively, we or our service providers must continually maintain and update them. Delays in the maintenance, updates, upgrading, or patching of these systems and related business processes could impair their effectiveness or expose us to security risks. Even with our policies, procedures and programs designed to ensure the integrity of our IT systems and the security of Data, we may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to which we are exposed. In some instances, we may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities, which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. Despite the precautions we take to mitigate the risks of such events, any attack on our IT systems or breach of our Data, or the IT systems and Data of third parties upon whom we depend, could result in, but are not limited to, the following: business disruption, misstated or misappropriated financial data, product shortages and/ or an increase in accounts receivable aging, an adverse impact on our ability to attract and serve customers, delays in the execution of our business plan, theft of our intellectual property or other non-public confidential information and Data, including that of our customers, suppliers, and employees, liability for stolen assets or information, and higher operating costs including increased cybersecurity protection costs. Such events could harm our reputation and have an adverse impact on our financial results, including the impact of related legal, regulatory, and remediation costs.

On July 6, 2023, we reached agreement with CD&R to Repurchase all of the issued and outstanding Series A Preferred Stock. Even if the Repurchase had occurred on June 30, 2023, the CD&R Stockholder would still have beneficially owned shares of our common stock which represent approximately 23.9%. As a result, the CD&R Stockholder may have the indirect ability to significantly influence our policies and operations.

1108,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.8,Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes,13.8.1,"Our level and terms of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, take advantage of new business opportunities and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our debt instruments, including the notes.","As disclosed under the heading “Use of Proceeds,” we intend to use the net proceeds from this offering of notes, together with cash on hand and a portion of the $1.04 billion in net available borrowings under the 2026 ABL, to (i) repurchase in full, for an aggregate cash amount equal to $804.5 million, all 400,000 issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the CD&R Stockholder, (ii) pay all accrued but unpaid dividends on such shares of Series A Preferred Stock as of the Repurchase Date, and (iii) pay all related transaction fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing. The proceeds from the offering of notes may therefore not be available to service our outstanding indebtedness, including the notes offered hereby. As of 21 ----- March 31, 2023, after giving effect to the Repurchase Transactions, we would have had approximately $552.0 million outstanding balance on our asset-based revolving line of credit due in 2026, $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.50% senior secured notes due in 2026 outstanding, $350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.125% senior notes due in 2029 outstanding, and $982.5 million outstanding under our senior secured term loan due in 2028. Our debt levels could have important consequences to us, including: - increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions; - requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow used in operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our liquidity and our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities; - exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates, and corresponding increased interest expense, because future borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities would be at variable rates of interest; - reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, due to the costs and expenses associated with such debt; - making it more difficult to satisfy our obligations under the terms of our indebtedness; - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes; and - limiting our ability to adjust to changing marketplace conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may have less debt. In addition, the debt agreements that currently govern our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Existing Indentures impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including limitations on our ability to, among other things, pay dividends and make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock; make certain investments; incur certain liens; enter into transactions with affiliates; merge or consolidate; enter into agreements that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments to the Issuer; and transfer or sell assets. The New Indenture will have similar restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, we will be limited as to how we conduct our business, and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to capitalize on available business opportunities. Our liquidity at March 31, 2023, after giving effect to the Repurchase Transactions, would have included $723.0 million in net borrowing availability under the 2026 ABL (subject to availability under a borrowing base and after giving effect to approximately $15.7 million of letters of credit which were outstanding as of March 31, 2023) and $74.2 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand. See “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness— Senior Secured Credit Facilities.” We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of liquidity sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium and interest on our indebtedness. In addition to competitive conditions in the industry in which we operate, our financial condition and operating performance are also subject to prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations, which could cause us to default on our debt obligations and impair our liquidity. In the event of a default under any of our indebtedness, the holders of the defaulted debt could elect to declare all the funds borrowed to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, which in turn could result in cross-defaults under our other indebtedness. The lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities could also elect to terminate their commitments thereunder and cease making further loans, and such lenders could institute foreclosure proceedings against their collateral, which could potentially force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. 22 -----",,as_expected,2023,160,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions; ... our financial condition and operating performance are also subject to prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control.\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""Yes"", ""evidence"": ""increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions; ... our financial condition and operating performance are also subject to prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control.""}, ""answer"": ""Yes"", ""evidence"": ""increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions; ... our financial condition and operating performance are also subject to prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control."", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: Our level and terms of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, take advantage of new business opportunities and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our debt instruments, including the notes.\nText: As disclosed under the heading \u201cUse of Proceeds,\u201d we intend to use the net proceeds from this offering of notes, together with cash on hand and a portion of the $1.04 billion in net available borrowings under the 2026 ABL, to (i) repurchase in full, for an aggregate cash amount equal to $804.5 million, all 400,000 issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the CD&R Stockholder, (ii) pay all accrued but unpaid dividends on such shares of Series A Preferred Stock as of the Repurchase Date, and (iii) pay all related transaction fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing.

If we or one of the subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the notes becomes the subject of a bankruptcy case or a lawsuit filed by creditors of us or any such guarantor, the issuance of such notes, the guarantees entered into by these guarantors or the grant of the security interests in favor of such notes may be reviewed under the federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws. Under these laws, such notes, a guarantee and/or a grant of security could be voided, or claims in respect of such notes, a guarantee and/or a security interest could be subordinated to other obligations of us or the applicable guarantor if, among other things, we or the applicable guarantor, at the time the indebtedness evidenced by such notes or a guarantee, as applicable, was incurred or a security interest was granted: - received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for issuing the notes, entering into the guarantee or granting the security interest; and - either: - were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of issuing the notes, entering into such guarantee or grant; - were left with inadequate capital to conduct our business; - believed or reasonably should have believed that we would incur debts or contingent liabilities beyond our ability to pay such debts or contingent liabilities as they become due; or - were a defendant in an action for money damages or had a judgment for money damages docketed against us if, in either case, the judgment is unsatisfied after final judgment. 28 ----- The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, however, we, a guarantor or a grantor would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all of its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - we or such guarantor could not pay its debts or contingent liabilities as they become due. We cannot assure you as to what standard a court would use to determine whether or not we or a guarantor would be solvent at the relevant time, or regardless of the standard used, that any guarantee or grant of security would not be subordinated to any guarantor’s or grantor’s other debt. A court might also void the notes, a guarantee or a grant of security, without regard to the above factors, if the court found that we issued such notes or the applicable guarantor entered into the applicable guaranty or security agreements with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud our or their respective creditors. If a court were to void the notes, a guarantee or a grant of security, a holder of such notes would no longer have a claim against us or the applicable guarantor, or, in the case of the security interest, a claim with respect to the related Collateral. In such event, any payment by a guarantor pursuant to its guarantee of such notes or claim on the Collateral securing such notes or a guarantee of such notes could be voided and required to be returned to the applicable guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of other creditors under those circumstances. If a guarantee and/or a security interest were voided as a fraudulent transfer or held unenforceable for any other reason, in all likelihood holders of the notes would be creditors solely of the Issuer and those guarantors whose guarantees and grants of security had not been voided, and holders of the notes would not get the benefit of a security interest in respect of the security interests that had been voided. The notes then would in effect be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of any guarantor whose guarantee was voided and, as a result of such voided security interest, effectively subordinated to obligations with a valid security interest in such Collateral. Sufficient funds to repay such notes may not be available from other sources. Moreover, the invalidation of a guarantee could result in acceleration of such debt. Each guarantee contains a provision intended to limit the guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer. This provision may not be effective to protect the guarantees from being voided under fraudulent transfer law or may reduce or eliminate the guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes the guarantee worthless.

If we or one of the subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the notes becomes the subject of a bankruptcy case or a lawsuit filed by creditors of us or any such guarantor, the issuance of such notes, the guarantees entered into by these guarantors or the grant of the security interests in favor of such notes may be reviewed under the federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws. Under these laws, such notes, a guarantee and/or a grant of security could be voided, or claims in respect of such notes, a guarantee and/or a security interest could be subordinated to other obligations of us or the applicable guarantor if, among other things, we or the applicable guarantor, at the time the indebtedness evidenced by such notes or a guarantee, as applicable, was incurred or a security interest was granted: - received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for issuing the notes, entering into the guarantee or granting the security interest; and - either: - were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of issuing the notes, entering into such guarantee or grant; - were left with inadequate capital to conduct our business; - believed or reasonably should have believed that we would incur debts or contingent liabilities beyond our ability to pay such debts or contingent liabilities as they become due; or - were a defendant in an action for money damages or had a judgment for money damages docketed against us if, in either case, the judgment is unsatisfied after final judgment. 28 ----- The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, however, we, a guarantor or a grantor would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all of its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - we or such guarantor could not pay its debts or contingent liabilities as they become due. We cannot assure you as to what standard a court would use to determine whether or not we or a guarantor would be solvent at the relevant time, or regardless of the standard used, that any guarantee or grant of security would not be subordinated to any guarantor\u2019s or grantor\u2019s other debt. A court might also void the notes, a guarantee or a grant of security, without regard to the above factors, if the court found that we issued such notes or the applicable guarantor entered into the applicable guaranty or security agreements with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud our or their respective creditors. If a court were to void the notes, a guarantee or a grant of security, a holder of such notes would no longer have a claim against us or the applicable guarantor, or, in the case of the security interest, a claim with respect to the related Collateral. In such event, any payment by a guarantor pursuant to its guarantee of such notes or claim on the Collateral securing such notes or a guarantee of such notes could be voided and required to be returned to the applicable guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of other creditors under those circumstances. If a guarantee and/or a security interest were voided as a fraudulent transfer or held unenforceable for any other reason, in all likelihood holders of the notes would be creditors solely of the Issuer and those guarantors whose guarantees and grants of security had not been voided, and holders of the notes would not get the benefit of a security interest in respect of the security interests that had been voided. The notes then would in effect be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of any guarantor whose guarantee was voided and, as a result of such voided security interest, effectively subordinated to obligations with a valid security interest in such Collateral. Sufficient funds to repay such notes may not be available from other sources. Moreover, the invalidation of a guarantee could result in acceleration of such debt. Each guarantee contains a provision intended to limit the guarantor\u2019s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer. This provision may not be effective to protect the guarantees from being voided under fraudulent transfer law or may reduce or eliminate the guarantor\u2019s obligation to an amount that effectively makes the guarantee worthless.

For example, under the Bankruptcy Code, pursuant to the automatic stay imposed upon the bankruptcy filing, a secured creditor is prohibited from repossessing its Collateral from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of Collateral repossessed from such debtor, or from taking other actions to levy against a debtor, without bankruptcy court approval after notice and a hearing. Moreover, the Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use Collateral even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” is undefined in the Bankruptcy Code and may vary according to circumstances (and is within the discretion of the bankruptcy court), but it is intended in general to protect the secured creditor’s interest in the Collateral from diminishing in value during the pendency of the bankruptcy case and may include periodic payments or the granting of additional security, if and at such times as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of the Collateral as a result of the automatic stay or any sale, use or lease of the Collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court could conclude that the secured creditor’s interest in its Collateral is “adequately protected” against any diminution in value during the bankruptcy case without the need for providing any additional adequate protection, including if the court determines the value of the Collateral exceeds the principal outstanding under the notes. Due to the imposition of the automatic stay, the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict (i) how long payments under such notes could be delayed, or, if made at all, following commencement of a bankruptcy case, (ii) whether or when the controlling collateral agent could repossess or dispose of the Collateral or (iii) whether or to what extent holders of the notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral through the requirement of “adequate protection.” Furthermore, any future pledge of Collateral or guarantee in favor of the collateral agent for its benefit, or for the benefit of the trustee and the holders of the notes, might be voidable in a bankruptcy case of the relevant pledgor or guarantor if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including if the pledgor or guarantor is insolvent at the time of the pledge or guarantee; the pledge or guarantee enables the holders of the notes to receive more than they would if the pledge or guarantee had not been made and the debtor were liquidated under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code; and a bankruptcy case in respect of the pledgor or guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge or guarantee (or within one year following the pledge or guarantee if the creditor that benefited therefrom is an insider under the Bankruptcy Code), any of which could result in a material adverse effect on the ability of the collateral agent or the holders of notes to realize value from the Collateral.",,as_expected,2023,160,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: Bankruptcy laws may limit the ability of holders of the notes to realize value from the Collateral.\nText: The right of the controlling collateral agent under the Intercreditor Agreements to repossess and dispose of the Collateral is likely to be significantly impaired by applicable bankruptcy law if a bankruptcy case were to be 32 ----- commenced by or against the Issuer or any of the guarantors before such collateral agent repossessed and disposed of the Collateral.

Such redemption may be made upon notice mailed or otherwise delivered to each Holder in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC (or, if the Notes are then certificated, to each Holder’s registered address), not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date (but in no event more than 180 days after the completion of the related Equity Offering). The Company may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and the performance of the Company’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person. Any such notice may, in the Company’s discretion, be given prior to the completion of the related Equity Offering, and any such redemption and notice may, in the Company’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, including the completion of the related Equity Offering. “Equity Offering” means a sale after the Issue Date of Capital Stock (i) that is a sale of Capital Stock of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock or sales to Subsidiaries of the Company or sales the proceeds of which constitute an Excluded Contribution) or (ii) the proceeds of which in an amount equal to or exceeding the amount used to redeem the Notes are contributed to the equity capital of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than proceeds from a sale to Subsidiaries of Capital Stock of the Company or proceeds that constitute an Excluded Contribution). 48 ----- At any time and from time to time from and after the Issue Date and prior to, 2026, Notes may also be redeemed in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at the Company’s option, at a price (the “Redemption Price”) equal to 100.0% of the principal amount thereof plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the Redemption Date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes (including any offer to purchase the Notes as described under “—Change of Control” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”), if Holders of not less than 90% in the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Company, or any other Person making such tender offer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Company or such other Person will have the right, upon notice given not more than 10 days following such purchase pursuant to such tender offer, to redeem all of the Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to the price offered to each Holder in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the Redemption Date. Such redemption may be made upon notice mailed or otherwise delivered to each Holder in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC (or, if the Notes are then certificated, to each Holder’s registered address), not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date.

The security interests on the ABL Priority Collateral securing the Notes, the Subsidiary Guarantees and the other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations will be junior in priority to any and all security interests on the ABL Priority Collateral at any time granted to secure the ABL Facility Obligations. The security interests on the Non-ABL Priority Collateral securing the Notes, the Subsidiary Guarantees and the other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations will be senior in priority to any and all security interests on the Non-ABL Priority Collateral at any time granted to secure the ABL Facility Obligations. The security interests on the Collateral securing the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees will be equal in priority to any and all security interests on the Collateral at any time granted to secure the other Non-ABL Loan/ Notes Obligations (including the Term Loan Obligations and the 2026 Secured Notes Obligations). A Person holding a prior ranking Lien on any Collateral will have rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to such Liens that, if exercised, could adversely affect the value of the Collateral or the ability of the Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose on the Collateral on behalf of Holders of the Notes. The “ABL Priority Collateral” will consist of the following assets of the Issuer and the other Grantors, whether owned on the Issue Date or thereafter acquired (in each case to the extent not constituting Excluded Assets) (i) accounts and other receivables, (ii) chattel paper, (iii) deposit accounts (and all cash, checks and other negotiable instruments, funds and other evidences of payment held therein, but excluding the Non-ABL Priority Collateral Pledged Account) and all securities accounts, security entitlements and securities (other than equity interests in any Subsidiary of the Issuer), (iv) inventory, (v) to the extent evidencing, governing, securing or otherwise related to any of the foregoing and the other ABL Priority Collateral, all documents, general intangibles (excluding equity interests in any Subsidiary of the Issuer and all intellectual property but including loans or advances payable by a Grantor to any other Grantor), instruments, investment property (but not equity interests in any Subsidiary of the Issuer), commercial tort claims, letters of credit, supporting obligations and letter of credit rights, (vi) all books, records and documents related to the foregoing (including databases, customer lists and other records, whether tangible or electronic, which contain any information relating to any of the foregoing) and (vii) all proceeds and products of any or all of the foregoing in whatever form received, including proceeds of business interruption and other insurance and claims against third parties. In addition, extraordinary receipts solely to the extent constituting proceeds of judgments relating to any of the ABL Priority Collateral, insurance proceeds and condemnation awards in respect of any ABL Priority Collateral, indemnity payments in respect of any ABL Priority Collateral and purchase price adjustments in connection with any ABL 52 ----- Priority Collateral will also constitute ABL Priority Collateral; provided that to the extent such receipts constitute proceeds of both ABL Priority Collateral and Non-ABL Priority Collateral, only that portion attributable to ABL Priority Collateral shall constitute ABL Priority Collateral. Proceeds of Excluded Assets that would otherwise constitute ABL Priority Collateral will be deemed to be ABL Priority Collateral. The “Non-ABL Priority Collateral” will consist of all Collateral of the Issuer and the other Grantors, whether owned on the Issue Date or thereafter acquired (in each case to the extent not constituting Excluded Assets) other than the ABL Priority Collateral (including identifiable proceeds of ABL Priority Collateral). In addition, extraordinary receipts solely to the extent constituting proceeds of judgments relating to any of the Non-ABL Priority Collateral, insurance proceeds and condemnation awards in respect of any Non-ABL Priority Collateral, indemnity payments in respect of any Non-ABL Priority Collateral and purchase price adjustments in connection with any Non-ABL Priority Collateral will also constitute Non-ABL Priority Collateral; provided that to the extent such receipts constitute proceeds of both Non-ABL Priority Collateral and ABL Priority Collateral, only that portion attributable to Non-ABL Priority Collateral shall constitute Non-ABL Priority Collateral. Proceeds of Excluded Assets that would otherwise constitute Non-ABL Priority Collateral will be deemed to be Non-ABL Priority Collateral. Subject to the terms described below under “—Collateral—Release”, the Collateral will consist of substantially the same assets that secure the Term Loan Obligations, the 2026 Secured Notes Obligations and the ABL Facility Obligations (other than the assets of a Foreign Grantor that is a CFC or of a Grantor which is a FSHCO which, in each case, may secure all or any portion of the ABL Facility Obligations, but not the Notes or any Term Loan Obligations or the 2026 Secured Notes Obligations). The Collateral is expected to consist of substantially all of the property and assets of the Issuer and the other Grantors, subject to a variety of exceptions, including those described below. The implementation of certain of the Collateral that will secure the Notes will be delayed, and Holders will not have the benefit of such Collateral during such delay. In addition, the Indenture will require the Issuer to deliver to the Collateral Agent (i) within 120 days of the Issue Date (or such longer period as the Collateral Agent may agree), control agreements (or amendments to existing control agreements), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, duly executed by the applicable Grantor, the Collateral Agent and each depository bank or Securities intermediary, as applicable, at which a Deposit Account that is not a Specified Deposit Account or a Securities Account that is not Specified Investment Property, as the case may be, is maintained, which will be sufficient to establish Control over such Deposit Account or such Securities Account (in each case, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreements) and (ii) within 120 days of the Issue Date (or such longer period as the Collateral Agent may agree), copies of insurance certificates and endorsements of insurance, in each case in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent. For a period of time after the Issue Date until, and subject to the execution and delivery of the aforementioned control agreements, the Holders will not have a validly perfected security interest in the real property and the Deposit Accounts and Securities Accounts pledged to secure the Term Loan Obligations, the 2026 Secured Notes Obligations and the ABL Facility Obligations. See “—Collateral—Collateral Documents” below. The Collateral will not include, among other things, the following property and assets of the Issuer and the other Grantors (collectively, the “Excluded Assets”): (1) Specified Deposit Accounts and Specified Investment Property; (2) any rights or interests in any contract, agreement, lease, permit, license, charter or license agreement, as such, if under the terms of such contract, agreement, lease, permit, license, charter or license agreement, or applicable law with respect thereto, the valid grant of a security interest or lien therein to the Collateral Agent would constitute or result in a breach, termination or default under such contract, agreement, lease, permit, license, charter or license agreement and such breach, termination or default has not been or is not waived or the consent of the other party to such contract, agreement, lease, permit, license, charter or license agreement has not been or is not otherwise obtained or under applicable law such prohibition cannot be waived; provided that the 53 ----- foregoing exclusion will in no way be construed (i) to apply to the extent that any such prohibition is unenforceable under Sections 9-406, 9-407 or 9-408 of the New York UCC or other applicable law or (ii) so as to limit, impair or otherwise affect the Collateral Agent’s unconditional continuing security interests in and Liens upon any rights or interests of a Grantor in or to monies due or to become due under, or other Proceeds for receivables relating to, any such contract, lease, permit, license, charter or license agreement; (3) any United States intent-to-use trademark applications to the extent that, and solely during the period in which, the grant of a security interest therein would impair the validity or enforceability of such intent-to-use trademark applications under applicable federal law or would impair the validity or enforceability or render void or result in the cancellation of any registration issued as a result of such intent to-use trademark application under applicable federal law; provided that upon submission and acceptance by the United States Patent and Trademark Office of an amendment to allege use pursuant to 15 U.S.C. Section 1060(a), such intent-to-use trademark application shall be considered Collateral; (4) any governmental licenses or state or local franchises, charters and authorizations, to the extent security interests in such licenses, franchises, charters or authorizations are prohibited thereby; provided that the foregoing exclusion shall in no way be construed (i) to apply to the extent that any such prohibition is unenforceable under Sections 9-406, 9-407 or 9-408 of the New York UCC or other applicable law or (ii) so as to limit, impair or otherwise affect the Collateral Agent’s unconditional continuing security interests in and Liens upon any Proceeds or receivables thereof; (5) Equipment or any other asset (other than Inventory (as defined in the New York UCC)) owned by any Grantor on the Issue Date or hereafter acquired that is subject to a Lien securing a purchase money obligation or Capitalized Lease Obligation permitted to be incurred pursuant to the Indenture if the contract or other agreement in which such Lien is granted validly prohibits the creation of any other Lien on such Equipment or other asset; (6) more than 65% of the outstanding voting Capital Stock and 100% of the outstanding non-voting Capital Stock (if any) in any Foreign Subsidiary of the Issuer, unless and until a greater percentage of such voting Capital Stock is pledged to secure the Term Loan Obligations; and (7) all real property leasehold interests. The Excluded Assets will not include the Proceeds, products, substitutions or replacements of any Excluded Asset (except to the extent that such Proceeds, products, substitutions or replacements will themselves constitute Excluded Assets). No Grantor will be required to perfect security interests (i) in any vehicle or other asset subject to certificate of title other than by filing UCC financing statements in the appropriate jurisdiction, (ii) in Letter-of-Credit Rights as to any letter of credit with a value of less than $250,000, (iii) in any Commercial Tort Claims with a value of less than $1,000,000, (iv) in any promissory notes in a principal amount of less than $1,500,000 or (v) under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or Canada. The security interests securing the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees will be subject to all existing and future Permitted Liens and other Liens permitted by the Indenture, certain of which, such as Liens arising as a matter of law, will have priority over the security interests securing the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees. The Issuer and the other Grantors will be able to incur additional Indebtedness in the future that could share in the Collateral, including Additional Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, ABL Facility Obligations (or Obligations secured on a pari passu basis with the ABL Facility Obligations) and/or obligations secured by junior liens. The amount of such Indebtedness will be limited by the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” However, the amount of such Indebtedness could be significant. 54 -----",,as_expected,2023,160,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: Description of Collateral\nText: The Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees, will, with certain exceptions, have the benefit of Liens on the Collateral, including after-acquired Collateral, which will consist of (i) first-priority security interests in the Non-ABL Priority Collateral and (ii) second-priority security interests in the ABL Priority Collateral as to which the ABL Facility Secured Parties have a first-priority security interest, in each case, subject to a shared lien of equal priority with the other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, including the Term Loan Obligations, the 2026 Secured Notes Obligations and related guarantees, and subject to existing and future Permitted Liens and other Liens permitted by the Indenture, which may rank prior to the security interests securing the Notes.

A Person holding a prior ranking Lien on any Collateral will have rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to such Liens that, if exercised, could adversely affect the value of the Collateral or the ability of the Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose on the Collateral on behalf of Holders of the Notes. The \u201cABL Priority Collateral\u201d will consist of the following assets of the Issuer and the other Grantors, whether owned on the Issue Date or thereafter acquired (in each case to the extent not constituting Excluded Assets) (i) accounts and other receivables, (ii) chattel paper, (iii) deposit accounts (and all cash, checks and other negotiable instruments, funds and other evidences of payment held therein, but excluding the Non-ABL Priority Collateral Pledged Account) and all securities accounts, security entitlements and securities (other than equity interests in any Subsidiary of the Issuer), (iv) inventory, (v) to the extent evidencing, governing, securing or otherwise related to any of the foregoing and the other ABL Priority Collateral, all documents, general intangibles (excluding equity interests in any Subsidiary of the Issuer and all intellectual property but including loans or advances payable by a Grantor to any other Grantor), instruments, investment property (but not equity interests in any Subsidiary of the Issuer), commercial tort claims, letters of credit, supporting obligations and letter of credit rights, (vi) all books, records and documents related to the foregoing (including databases, customer lists and other records, whether tangible or electronic, which contain any information relating to any of the foregoing) and (vii) all proceeds and products of any or all of the foregoing in whatever form received, including proceeds of business interruption and other insurance and claims against third parties. In addition, extraordinary receipts solely to the extent constituting proceeds of judgments relating to any of the ABL Priority Collateral, insurance proceeds and condemnation awards in respect of any ABL Priority Collateral, indemnity payments in respect of any ABL Priority Collateral and purchase price adjustments in connection with any ABL 52 ----- Priority Collateral will also constitute ABL Priority Collateral; provided that to the extent such receipts constitute proceeds of both ABL Priority Collateral and Non-ABL Priority Collateral, only that portion attributable to ABL Priority Collateral shall constitute ABL Priority Collateral. Proceeds of Excluded Assets that would otherwise constitute ABL Priority Collateral will be deemed to be ABL Priority Collateral. The \u201cNon-ABL Priority Collateral\u201d will consist of all Collateral of the Issuer and the other Grantors, whether owned on the Issue Date or thereafter acquired (in each case to the extent not constituting Excluded Assets) other than the ABL Priority Collateral (including identifiable proceeds of ABL Priority Collateral). In addition, extraordinary receipts solely to the extent constituting proceeds of judgments relating to any of the Non-ABL Priority Collateral, insurance proceeds and condemnation awards in respect of any Non-ABL Priority Collateral, indemnity payments in respect of any Non-ABL Priority Collateral and purchase price adjustments in connection with any Non-ABL Priority Collateral will also constitute Non-ABL Priority Collateral; provided that to the extent such receipts constitute proceeds of both Non-ABL Priority Collateral and ABL Priority Collateral, only that portion attributable to Non-ABL Priority Collateral shall constitute Non-ABL Priority Collateral. Proceeds of Excluded Assets that would otherwise constitute Non-ABL Priority Collateral will be deemed to be Non-ABL Priority Collateral. Subject to the terms described below under \u201c\u2014Collateral\u2014Release\u201d, the Collateral will consist of substantially the same assets that secure the Term Loan Obligations, the 2026 Secured Notes Obligations and the ABL Facility Obligations (other than the assets of a Foreign Grantor that is a CFC or of a Grantor which is a FSHCO which, in each case, may secure all or any portion of the ABL Facility Obligations, but not the Notes or any Term Loan Obligations or the 2026 Secured Notes Obligations). The Collateral is expected to consist of substantially all of the property and assets of the Issuer and the other Grantors, subject to a variety of exceptions, including those described below. The implementation of certain of the Collateral that will secure the Notes will be delayed, and Holders will not have the benefit of such Collateral during such delay. In addition, the Indenture will require the Issuer to deliver to the Collateral Agent (i) within 120 days of the Issue Date (or such longer period as the Collateral Agent may agree), control agreements (or amendments to existing control agreements), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, duly executed by the applicable Grantor, the Collateral Agent and each depository bank or Securities intermediary, as applicable, at which a Deposit Account that is not a Specified Deposit Account or a Securities Account that is not Specified Investment Property, as the case may be, is maintained, which will be sufficient to establish Control over such Deposit Account or such Securities Account (in each case, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreements) and (ii) within 120 days of the Issue Date (or such longer period as the Collateral Agent may agree), copies of insurance certificates and endorsements of insurance, in each case in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent. For a period of time after the Issue Date until, and subject to the execution and delivery of the aforementioned control agreements, the Holders will not have a validly perfected security interest in the real property and the Deposit Accounts and Securities Accounts pledged to secure the Term Loan Obligations, the 2026 Secured Notes Obligations and the ABL Facility Obligations. See \u201c\u2014Collateral\u2014Collateral Documents\u201d below. The Collateral will not include, among other things, the following property and assets of the Issuer and the other Grantors (collectively, the \u201cExcluded Assets\u201d): (1) Specified Deposit Accounts and Specified Investment Property; (2) any rights or interests in any contract, agreement, lease, permit, license, charter or license agreement, as such, if under the terms of such contract, agreement, lease, permit, license, charter or license agreement, or applicable law with respect thereto, the valid grant of a security interest or lien therein to the Collateral Agent would constitute or result in a breach, termination or default under such contract, agreement, lease, permit, license, charter or license agreement and such breach, termination or default has not been or is not waived or the consent of the other party to such contract, agreement, lease, permit, license, charter or license agreement has not been or is not otherwise obtained or under applicable law such prohibition cannot be waived; provided that the 53 ----- foregoing exclusion will in no way be construed (i) to apply to the extent that any such prohibition is unenforceable under Sections 9-406, 9-407 or 9-408 of the New York UCC or other applicable law or (ii) so as to limit, impair or otherwise affect the Collateral Agent\u2019s unconditional continuing security interests in and Liens upon any rights or interests of a Grantor in or to monies due or to become due under, or other Proceeds for receivables relating to, any such contract, lease, permit, license, charter or license agreement; (3) any United States intent-to-use trademark applications to the extent that, and solely during the period in which, the grant of a security interest therein would impair the validity or enforceability of such intent-to-use trademark applications under applicable federal law or would impair the validity or enforceability or render void or result in the cancellation of any registration issued as a result of such intent to-use trademark application under applicable federal law; provided that upon submission and acceptance by the United States Patent and Trademark Office of an amendment to allege use pursuant to 15 U.S.C. Section 1060(a), such intent-to-use trademark application shall be considered Collateral; (4) any governmental licenses or state or local franchises, charters and authorizations, to the extent security interests in such licenses, franchises, charters or authorizations are prohibited thereby; provided that the foregoing exclusion shall in no way be construed (i) to apply to the extent that any such prohibition is unenforceable under Sections 9-406, 9-407 or 9-408 of the New York UCC or other applicable law or (ii) so as to limit, impair or otherwise affect the Collateral Agent\u2019s unconditional continuing security interests in and Liens upon any Proceeds or receivables thereof; (5) Equipment or any other asset (other than Inventory (as defined in the New York UCC)) owned by any Grantor on the Issue Date or hereafter acquired that is subject to a Lien securing a purchase money obligation or Capitalized Lease Obligation permitted to be incurred pursuant to the Indenture if the contract or other agreement in which such Lien is granted validly prohibits the creation of any other Lien on such Equipment or other asset; (6) more than 65% of the outstanding voting Capital Stock and 100% of the outstanding non-voting Capital Stock (if any) in any Foreign Subsidiary of the Issuer, unless and until a greater percentage of such voting Capital Stock is pledged to secure the Term Loan Obligations; and (7) all real property leasehold interests. The Excluded Assets will not include the Proceeds, products, substitutions or replacements of any Excluded Asset (except to the extent that such Proceeds, products, substitutions or replacements will themselves constitute Excluded Assets). No Grantor will be required to perfect security interests (i) in any vehicle or other asset subject to certificate of title other than by filing UCC financing statements in the appropriate jurisdiction, (ii) in Letter-of-Credit Rights as to any letter of credit with a value of less than $250,000, (iii) in any Commercial Tort Claims with a value of less than $1,000,000, (iv) in any promissory notes in a principal amount of less than $1,500,000 or (v) under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or Canada. The security interests securing the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees will be subject to all existing and future Permitted Liens and other Liens permitted by the Indenture, certain of which, such as Liens arising as a matter of law, will have priority over the security interests securing the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees. The Issuer and the other Grantors will be able to incur additional Indebtedness in the future that could share in the Collateral, including Additional Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, ABL Facility Obligations (or Obligations secured on a pari passu basis with the ABL Facility Obligations) and/or obligations secured by junior liens. The amount of such Indebtedness will be limited by the covenants described under \u201c\u2014Certain Covenants\u2014Limitation on Indebtedness\u201d and \u201c\u2014Certain Covenants\u2014Limitation on Liens.\u201d However, the amount of such Indebtedness could be significant. 54 -----\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}",,,

1108,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,238,DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS,238.16,Collateral,238.16.5,Intercreditor Agreements,"On the Issue Date, the Notes will be subject to two intercreditor agreements: (1) the ABL Intercreditor Agreement and (2) the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. Holders of the Notes will be deemed to have agreed and accepted the terms of the Intercreditor Agreements by their acceptance of the Notes. The Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees will, with certain exceptions, have the benefit of Liens on the Collateral, including after-acquired Collateral, which will consist of (i) first-priority security interests in the Non-ABL Priority Collateral and (ii) second-priority security interests in the ABL Priority Collateral as to which the ABL Facility Secured Parties have a first-priority security interest. See “—Collateral—Description of Collateral.” In addition, the Indenture will provide that in the event that the Issuer or any other Grantor Incurs, in compliance with the Indenture, Indebtedness that is secured by any or all of the Collateral (whether on a juniorpriority or pari passu basis with the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees), the Collateral Agent will, at the request of the Issuer, enter into (i) in the case of such Indebtedness so secured on a junior-priority basis, one or more intercreditor agreements reasonably acceptable to the Collateral Agent or (ii) in the case of such Indebtedness so secured on a pari passu basis, an amendment or supplement to each applicable Intercreditor Agreement with terms that are reasonably acceptable to the Collateral Agent, in each case, with the Representative of such Indebtedness and any other applicable Representatives of Obligations. 57 ----- BY ACCEPTING A NOTE EACH HOLDER SHALL BE BOUND BY THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENTS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. ABL Intercreditor Agreement The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will provide, among other things, that: (1) (i) Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral securing the Obligations in respect of the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees will be junior to the Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral securing the ABL Facility Obligations up to the ABL Cap, and consequently, the holders of ABL Facility Obligations will be entitled to receive the proceeds from the disposition of any ABL Priority Collateral prior to the Holders of the Notes and (ii) Liens on the Non-ABL Priority Collateral securing the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations (including the Obligations in respect of Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees) up to the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Cap will be senior to the Liens on the Non-ABL Priority Collateral securing the ABL Facility Obligations, and consequently, holders of the Notes will be entitled to receive the proceeds from the disposition of any Non-ABL Priority Collateral prior to the holders of the ABL Facility Obligations; provided, however, that (x) Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral securing the Obligations in respect of the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees will be senior to the Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral securing any future ABL Facility Obligations in excess of the ABL Cap and (y) Liens on the Non-ABL Priority Collateral securing any future Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Obligations in respect of the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees) in excess of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Cap will be junior to the Liens on the Non-ABL Priority Collateral securing the ABL Facility Obligations (other than any ABL Facility Obligations in excess of the ABL Cap); “ABL Cap” shall mean $2,200,000,000; provided, that, if a DIP Financing is provided by an ABL Facility Secured Party in accordance with the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, as described below, the ABL Cap will be $2,420,000,000. “Non-ABL Loan/Notes Cap” shall mean $1,300,000,000 plus the “Maximum Incremental Amount” as such term is defined in the Senior Term Agreement as of May 19, 2021, except for this purpose substituting “$511,500,000” for the “$465,000,000” set forth in clause (i)(a) therein (or, in the event that the Senior Term Agreement is thereafter amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed, restated, refinanced or otherwise replaced, such other comparable term contained in such Senior Term Agreement, so long as the amount under such comparable term does not exceed the amount that would have been the “Maximum Incremental Amount” (as such term is defined in the Senior Term Agreement as of May 19, 2021 and taking into account the substitution provided for above)); provided, that, if a DIP Financing is provided by any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party in accordance with the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, as described below, the Non-ABL Loan/ Notes Cap will be $181,150,000 greater than the amount otherwise provided above. “Maximum Incremental Amount” as defined in the Senior Term Agreement means, at any time, the greater of (i) the excess, if any, of (a) the greater of (1) $465,000,000 and (2) 100% of Consolidated EBITDA for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters of the Issuer ending on or immediately prior to such time for which internal consolidated financial statements of the Issuer are available, over (b) the aggregate amount of all Incremental Term Loan Commitments (as defined in the Senior Term Agreement) established prior to such time pursuant to the Senior Term Agreement and all Incremental Equivalent Debt (as defined in the Senior Term Agreement) incurred or issued prior to such time in accordance with the Senior Term Agreement and (ii) such other amount, so long as, after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of any such Incremental Term Loans (as defined in the Senior Term Agreement) and/or incurrence or issuance of any Incremental Equivalent Debt, as applicable, and certain pro forma adjustments pursuant to the Senior Term Agreement, the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Senior Term Agreement) (calculated as if any Incremental Term Loan Commitment being established were fully drawn) is equal to or less than 3.75 to 1.00. (2) (x) so long as the Discharge of ABL Facility Obligations (as defined below) has not occurred, if the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent or any Holder of the Notes receives any proceeds from the disposition of 58 ----- any ABL Priority Collateral and (y) so long as the Discharge of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations (as defined below) has not occurred, if the ABL Agent or the holder of any ABL Facility Obligations receives any proceeds from the disposition of any Non-ABL Priority Collateral, such proceeds will be turned over to the Applicable Priority Agent entitled to receive such proceeds in accordance with the foregoing; (3) the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent will not contest or support any other Person in contesting, in any proceedings (including any Insolvency Proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity or enforceability of a Lien held by or for the benefit or on behalf of any ABL Facility Secured Party in any Collateral; (4) the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent and the ABL Agent intend that the Collateral securing the ABL Facility Obligations and Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations to be identical (other than the collateral of a Foreign Grantor that is a CFC or of a Grantor which is a FSHCO which, in each case, may secure all or any portion of the ABL Facility Obligations, but not the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations). In furtherance thereof, the ABL Agent and Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent will cooperate in good faith from time to time to determine the specific items of Collateral of the Grantors included in the ABL Priority Collateral and the Non-ABL Priority Collateral and the steps taken to perfect their respective Liens thereon; and (5) certain procedures for enforcing the Liens on the Collateral shall be followed. “Discharge of ABL Facility Obligations” shall mean, subject to the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement: (a) the payment in full in cash of the principal and interest (including any interest which would accrue and become due but for the commencement of an Insolvency Proceeding, whether or not such amounts are allowed or allowable in whole or in part in such case) constituting ABL Facility Obligations; (b) the payment in full in cash of all other ABL Facility Obligations that is due and payable or otherwise accrued and owing at or prior to the time such principal and interest are paid (including any such amounts which would accrue and become due but for the commencement of an Insolvency Proceeding, whether or not such amounts are allowed or allowable in whole or in part in such case), other than obligations described in clause (c) below; (c)(i) the delivery to the ABL Agent, or at the ABL Agent’s option, each Issuing Bank (as such term is defined in the Senior ABL Agreement) of cash collateral, or at the ABL Agent’s option, the delivery to the ABL Agent (or at its option, each Issuing Bank) of a letter of credit payable to the ABL Agent (or at the ABL Agent’s option, such Issuing Bank) issued by a bank reasonably acceptable to the ABL Agent (or if issued to such Issuing Bank, a bank reasonably acceptable to such Issuing Bank) in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the ABL Agent (or if issued to such Issuing Bank, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such Issuing Bank), in either case in respect of letters of credit, banker’s acceptances or similar or related instruments issued under the Senior ABL Agreement and ABL Facility Collateral Documents (in such amount as required by the Senior ABL Agreement and/or ABL Facility Collateral Documents but not to exceed one hundred five percent (105%) of the amount of such letters of credit, banker’s acceptances or similar or related instruments), (ii) the delivery of cash collateral in respect of ABL Bank Product Obligations (as defined in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement) or ABL Hedge Obligations (as defined in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement) owing to any ABL Facility Secured Party (or, at the option of the ABL Facility Secured Party with respect to such ABL Bank Product Obligations or ABL Hedge Obligations, the termination of the applicable Hedge Agreements, ABL Bank Product Agreement (as defined in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement) or cash management or other arrangements and the payment in full in cash of the ABL Facility Obligations due and payable in connection with such termination or the execution and implementation of alternative arrangements satisfactory to the applicable ABL Facility Secured Party), and (iii) the delivery of cash collateral to the ABL Agent, or at the ABL Agent’s option, the delivery to the ABL Agent of a letter of credit payable to the ABL Agent issued by a bank reasonably acceptable to the ABL Agent in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the ABL Agent, in respect of 59 ----- continuing obligations of the ABL Agent and ABL Facility Secured Parties under control agreements and other contingent ABL Facility Obligations for which a claim or demand for payment has been made at such time or in respect of matters or circumstances known to an ABL Facility Secured Party at the time, of which such ABL Facility Secured Party has informed the ABL Agent and which are reasonably expected to result in any loss, cost, damage or expense (including attorneys’ fees and legal expenses) to any ABL Facility Secured Party for which such ABL Facility Secured Party is entitled to indemnification by any Grantor; and (d) the termination of the commitments of the ABL Facility Secured Parties and the financing arrangements provided by the ABL Agent and the ABL Facility Secured Parties to Grantors under the Senior ABL Agreement and/or ABL Facility Collateral Documents. “Discharge of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations” shall mean, subject to the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement: (a) the payment in full in cash of the principal and interest (including any interest which would accrue and become due but for the commencement of an Insolvency Proceeding, whether or not such amounts are allowed or allowable in whole or in part in such case) constituting Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations; (b) the payment in full in cash of all other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations that is due and payable or otherwise accrued and owing at or prior to the time such principal and interest are paid (including any such amounts which would accrue and become due but for the commencement of an Insolvency Proceeding, whether or not such amounts are allowed or allowable in whole or in part in such case), other than obligations described in clause (c) below; (c) the delivery to the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent of cash collateral, or at the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent’s option, the delivery to Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent of a letter of credit payable to the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent issued by a bank reasonably acceptable to the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent, in either case in respect of contingent Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations for which a claim or demand for payment has been made at such time or in respect of matters or circumstances known to a Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party at the time, of which such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party has informed the Designated Term Loan/ Notes Agent and which are reasonably expected to result in any loss, cost, damage or expense (including attorneys’ fees and legal expenses) to any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party for which such Non-ABL Loan/ Notes Secured Party is entitled to indemnification by any Grantor; and (d) the termination of the commitments of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties and the financing arrangements provided by the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties to Grantors under the Non-ABL Loan/ Notes Debt Documents. Pursuant to the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, (x) so long as the ABL Facility Obligations are secured, the ABL Agent will determine the time and method by which the security interests in the ABL Priority Collateral will be enforced and (y) so long as the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations are secured, the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent will determine the time and method by which the security interests in the Non-ABL Priority Collateral will be enforced. The Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent will not be permitted to enforce the security interests on the ABL Priority Collateral even if an Event of Default under the Indenture has occurred and the Notes have been accelerated, except in any bankruptcy or liquidation proceeding as necessary to file a claim or statement of interest with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee and in certain other limited situations. In addition, the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent will be restricted from contesting any enforcement action or proceeding (or forbearance thereof) pursued by the ABL Agent with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral. After the discharge of the Liens securing the ABL Facility Obligations, the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent, acting at the instruction of the Applicable Authorized Representative, in accordance with the provisions of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, will determine the time and method by which its Liens in the ABL Priority 60 ----- Collateral will be enforced and, if applicable, will distribute proceeds (after payment of the costs of enforcement and collateral administration) of the Collateral received by it to the holders of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations in accordance with the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. Conversely, the ABL Agent will not be permitted to enforce the security interests on the Non-ABL Priority Collateral and will be similarly restricted from contesting any enforcement action or proceeding (or forbearance thereof) pursued by the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent with respect to the Non-ABL Priority Collateral until the discharge of the Liens securing the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations. In the event of any sale or other disposition of any ABL Priority Collateral permitted, or consented to by the ABL Agent, under the terms of the Senior ABL Agreement that results in the release of such ABL Agent’s Liens on any ABL Priority Collateral (including any sale or disposition in connection with the exercise by the ABL Agent of its enforcement remedies in respect of such ABL Priority Collateral, but excluding any other sale or disposition that is not permitted by the Indenture and the applicable Notes Collateral Documents), the Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral securing the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations (including the Obligations in respect of the Notes and Subsidiary Guarantees) will be automatically released to the same extent as such ABL Agent’s Lien; provided that the proceeds of any such sale or disposition shall be applied to the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations in accordance with the provisions governing the application of proceeds in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement and the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent will be required to take such actions (and will be deemed to have authorized such actions) as necessary to effect such release. In the event a bankruptcy proceeding shall be commenced by or against the Issuer or any other Grantor and the Applicable Priority Agent shall desire to permit the Issuer or any other Grantor to use cash collateral which constitutes ABL Priority Collateral or Non-ABL Priority Collateral, as applicable, or to enter into certain debtor-in-possession financings (a “DIP Financing”) in such proceeding, the Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral or Non-ABL Priority Collateral, as applicable, may, without any further action or consent by the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent (in the case of ABL Priority Collateral) or the ABL Agent (in the case of Non-ABL Priority Collateral), be made junior and subordinated to Liens granted to secure such DIP Financings (such Liens, “DIP Financing Liens”), to any adequate protection provided to the ABL Facility Secured Parties or Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties, as applicable, and to any “carve-out” or similar administrative priority expense or claim consented to in writing by the ABL Agent (in the case of ABL Priority Collateral) or the Term Loan Agent, 2026 Secured Notes Collateral Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable (in the case of Non-ABL Priority Collateral), to be paid prior to the Discharge of ABL Facility Obligations or Discharge of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, as applicable, subject to certain conditions. Under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, (x) each of the Term Loan Agent and the Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself and the applicable other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties, will not contest, or support any other Person in contesting (i) any request by the ABL Agent or any of the other ABL Facility Secured Parties for adequate protection with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral or any adequate protection provided to the ABL Agent or any of the other ABL Facility Secured Parties with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral or (ii) any objection by the ABL Agent or any of the other ABL Facility Secured Parties to any motion, relief, action or proceeding based on a claim of a lack of adequate protection with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral; and (y) the ABL Agent will not contest, or support any other Person in contesting (i) any request by the Term Loan Agent, 2026 Secured Notes Collateral Agent, Collateral Agent or any of the other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties for adequate protection with respect to the Non-ABL Priority Collateral or any adequate protection provided to the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent or any of the other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties with respect to the Non-ABL Priority Collateral or (ii) any objection by the Term Loan Agent, 2026 Secured Notes Collateral Agent, Collateral Agent or any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party to any motion, relief, action or proceeding based on a claim of a lack of adequate protection with respect to the Non-ABL Priority Collateral. Under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, the Term Loan Agent, 2026 Secured Notes Collateral Agent and Collateral Agent will only be permitted to seek adequate protection with respect to its security interests in ABL 61 ----- Priority Collateral without the prior written consent of the ABL Facility Secured Parties in limited circumstances. For example, if any or all of the ABL Facility Secured Parties are granted adequate protection in the form of additional collateral or a super-priority claim in connection with the use of cash collateral which constitutes ABL Priority Collateral or a DIP Financing or in connection with any Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral and such additional collateral is the type of asset or property that would constitute ABL Priority Collateral, then (A) each of the Term Loan Agent, 2026 Secured Notes Collateral Agent and the Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself or any of the applicable Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties, may seek or request adequate protection in the form of a Lien or super-priority claim on such additional collateral, which Lien or claim will be subordinated to the Liens securing the ABL Facility Obligations and such use of cash collateral constituting ABL Priority Collateral or DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto) on the same basis as the other Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral securing the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations are so subordinated to the Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral securing the ABL Facility Obligations under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement. The ABL Agent will be similarly limited in its ability to seek adequate protection with respect to its security interests in the Non-ABL Priority Collateral without the prior written consent of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will also limit the right of the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent and the other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties to seek relief from or modification of the “automatic stay” in respect of the ABL Priority Collateral. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent may not assert any right of marshalling, appraisal, valuation or other similar right that may be available under applicable law with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral. Until the Discharge of ABL Facility Obligations has occurred, in the event of any bankruptcy or liquidation proceeding, the Designated Term Loan/ Notes Agent and the other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties will not be permitted to object or oppose (or support any Person in objecting or opposing) a motion with respect to any sale, lease, license, exchange, transfer or other disposition of any ABL Priority Collateral free and clear of the Liens of the Designated Term Loan/ Notes Agent and the other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties or other claims under Section 363 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”), or any comparable provision of any bankruptcy law and shall be deemed to have consented to any such sale, lease, license, exchange, transfer or other disposition of any ABL Priority Collateral under Section 363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code that has been consented to by the ABL Agent; provided, that the proceeds of such sale, lease, license, exchange, transfer or other disposition of any ABL Priority Collateral shall be applied to the ABL Facility Obligations or the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations in accordance with the provisions governing the application of proceeds in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement or, if not so applied, the Liens of the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent or ABL Agent, as applicable, shall attach to the proceeds of such disposition subject to the relative priorities set forth in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will also limit the right of the ABL Agent and the other ABL Facility Secured Parties to seek relief from or modification of the “automatic stay” in respect of the Non-ABL Priority Collateral. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides that the ABL Agent may not assert any right of marshalling, appraisal, valuation or other similar right that may be available under applicable law with respect to the Non-ABL Priority Collateral. Until the Discharge of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations has occurred, in the event of any bankruptcy or liquidation proceeding, the ABL Agent and the other ABL Facility Secured Parties will not be permitted to object or oppose (or support any Person in objecting or opposing) a motion with respect to any sale, lease, license, exchange, transfer or other disposition of any Non-ABL Priority Collateral free and clear of the Liens of the ABL Agent and the other ABL Facility Secured Parties or other claims under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, or any comparable provision of any bankruptcy law and shall be deemed to have consented to any such sale, lease, license, exchange, transfer or other disposition of any Non-ABL Priority Collateral under Section 363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code that has been consented to by the Designated Term Loan/ Notes Agent; provided, that the proceeds of such sale, lease, license, exchange, transfer or other disposition of any Non-ABL Priority Collateral shall be applied to the ABL Facility Obligations or the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations in accordance with the provisions governing the application of proceeds in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement or, if not so applied, the Liens of the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent or ABL Agent, as applicable, shall attach to the proceeds of such disposition subject to the relative priorities set forth in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement. 62 ----- Under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, each of the Term Loan Agent, 2026 Secured Notes Collateral Agent and Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the other applicable Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties, waives any claim any such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party may hereafter have against any ABL Facility Secured Party arising out of the election by any ABL Facility Secured Party of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, or any comparable provision of any other bankruptcy law, with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral. The ABL Agent, for itself and on behalf of the ABL Facility Secured Parties with respect to which the ABL Agent is acting as agent, will make a corresponding waiver with respect to any claim the ABL Facility Secured Parties may have had arising out of any such election by any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party with respect to the Non-ABL Priority Collateral. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will also provide that neither the ABL Agent nor any other ABL Facility Secured Party will oppose or seek to challenge any claim by the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent or any other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party for allowance in any Insolvency Proceeding of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations consisting of Post-Petition Interest to the extent of the value of any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party’s Lien. In addition, neither the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent nor any other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party will oppose or seek to challenge any claim by the ABL Agent or any other ABL Facility Secured Party for allowance in any Insolvency Proceeding of ABL Facility Obligations consisting of Post-Petition Interest to the extent of the value of any ABL Facility Secured Party’s Lien. Under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, on or after the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the Senior ABL Agreement and the acceleration of all ABL Facility Obligations, including the commencement of an Insolvency Proceeding as to the Grantors that constitute such event of default (each a “Non-ABL Loan/Notes Purchase Event”), one or more of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties will have the option, for a period of ten Business Days after the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Purchase Event, to purchase all (but not less than all) of the ABL Facility Obligations from the ABL Facility Secured Parties. Any such purchasing Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties will be required on the date of purchase to (i) pay to the ABL Agent for the account of the ABL Facility Secured Parties as the purchase price therefor, the full amount of all ABL Facility Obligations then outstanding and unpaid (including principal at par and interest) and (ii) furnish cash collateral to the ABL Agent in such amounts as are required by the Senior ABL Agreement in connection with any issued and outstanding letters of credit, banker’s acceptances or similar or related instruments (but not in any event in an amount greater than one hundred five percent (105%) of the aggregate undrawn face amount of such letters of credit, banker’s acceptances and similar or related instruments). The ABL Facility Secured Parties will have a corresponding purchase option in respect of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations. Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement The rights and obligations of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement described below will be subject to the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement to the extent applicable. Generally, “Shared Collateral” means, at any time, Collateral in which the holders of two or more classes of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations (or their authorized Representatives) hold a valid and perfected security interest. Under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders of the Notes will be represented by the Trustee, the Term Loan Secured Parties will be represented by the Term Loan Agent, the 2026 Secured Notes Secured Parties will be represented by the 2026 Secured Notes Trustee and the holders of each class of Additional Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations will be represented by their respective Representative(s). The Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the priorities and other relative rights among the Holders and the holders of other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations (including the Term Loan Secured Parties and 2026 Secured Notes Secured Parties), including, among other things, that: (1) notwithstanding the date, time, method, manner or order of grant, attachment or perfection of any Liens on the Shared Collateral securing any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, the Liens securing all such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations shall be of equal priority; and 63 ----- (2) any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations may be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended or modified from time to time, in each case, to the extent permitted by the Indenture, the Senior Term Agreement, the 2026 Secured Notes Indenture and any other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Debt Documents, without affecting the relative priority with respect to other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations or the relative rights under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. The Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will also provide that only the “Applicable Authorized Representative” has the right to direct foreclosures and take other actions with respect to the Shared Collateral and that none of the other holders of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations or representatives in respect thereof will have any right to direct foreclosures or take such other actions. The Term Loan Agent will be the Applicable Authorized Representative until the earlier of (i) the date that all Obligations in respect of the Senior Term Agreement are no longer secured by the Shared Collateral and (ii) the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date (such earlier date, the “Applicable Authorized Agent Date”). At all times following the Applicable Authorized Agent Date, the Applicable Authorized Representative will be the Representative of the series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations (other than the Term Loan Obligations) that at such time constitutes the largest outstanding principal amount of any then-outstanding series of Non-ABL Loan/ Notes Obligations. The “Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date” is the date that is 180 days (throughout which 180-day period the Representative that is to replace the Applicable Authorized Representative was the Representative of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations that constitute the largest outstanding principal amount of any then-outstanding series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations (other than the Term Loan Obligations) (the “Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative”)) after the occurrence of both (a) an event of default under the terms of that class of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations and (b) the Trustee’s and each other Representative’s receipt of written notice from that Representative certifying that (i) such Representative is the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative and that an event of default with respect to such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations has occurred and is continuing and (ii) such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of the agreement governing those Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations; provided, however, that the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be stayed and shall not occur and shall be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Shared Collateral (1) at any time the Applicable Collateral Agent or the Applicable Authorized Representative has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to such Shared Collateral or (2) at any time the Issuer or any other Grantor that has granted a security interest in such Shared Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. “Applicable Collateral Agent” means (i) prior to the Applicable Authorized Agent Date, the Term Loan Agent, (ii) following the Applicable Authorized Agent Date, at any time the Trustee is the Applicable Authorized Representative, the Collateral Agent and (iii) following the Applicable Authorized Agent Date, at any time the Trustee is not the Applicable Authorized Representative, the collateral agent designated by the Applicable Authorized Representative. The Applicable Authorized Representative under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will have the sole right to instruct the Applicable Collateral Agent to act or refrain from acting with respect to the Shared Collateral, and the Applicable Collateral Agent will not follow any instructions with respect to such Shared Collateral from any other Person. No Representative of any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations or other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party (other than the Applicable Authorized Representative) will be entitled to instruct the Applicable Collateral Agent to commence any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its security interests in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, the Shared Collateral. 64 ----- Subject to the foregoing, notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens, the Applicable Collateral Agent, acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative, may deal with the Shared Collateral as if such Applicable Collateral Agent had a senior Lien on such Shared Collateral. No Representative of any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations or Non-Controlling Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party (other than the Applicable Authorized Representative) may contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Applicable Authorized Representative, a Controlling Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party or the Applicable Collateral Agent (acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative). The Trustee and each other Representative will agree that it will not accept any Lien on any Collateral for the benefit of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties (other than funds deposited for the discharge or defeasance of any Non-ABL Loan/ Notes Obligation or cash collateral in connection with a letter of credit or in connection with the obligations of a defaulting lender) other than pursuant to the Collateral Documents. Each holder of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, including the Holders by acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have agreed that it will not contest or support any other Person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any other holder of such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations in all or any part of the Collateral, or any of the provisions of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. If an event of default has occurred and is continuing under any documentation evidencing or governing any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations and the Applicable Collateral Agent or any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Shared Collateral, any distribution is made with respect to any Shared Collateral in any bankruptcy case of the Issuer or any Grantor and any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party receives any payment pursuant to any Intercreditor Agreement (other than the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Shared Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Collateral by the Applicable Collateral Agent or any other holder of such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations and proceeds of any such distribution, as applicable, will be applied among the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations to the payment in full of such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations on a ratable basis, after payment of all amounts owing to the Applicable Collateral Agent and the other Representatives, in their capacities as such. None of the holders of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations may institute any suit or assert in any suit, bankruptcy, insolvency or other proceeding any claim against the Applicable Collateral Agent or any other holder of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Collateral. In addition, none of the holders of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations may seek to have any Shared Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. None of the Applicable Collateral Agent, any Applicable Authorized Representative or any other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Applicable Collateral Agent, such Applicable Authorized Representative or other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party with respect to any Shared Collateral in accordance with the provisions of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. If any holder of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations obtains possession of any Shared Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof, in each case, as a result of the enforcement of remedies, at any time prior to the discharge of each of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, then it must hold such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other holders of Non-ABL Loan/ Notes Obligations and promptly transfer such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Applicable Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the Collateral Documents. If, at any time the Applicable Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Shared Collateral, then (whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of each series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released and discharged; provided that any proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom shall be allocated and applied pursuant to and in accordance with the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. The Applicable Collateral Agent and each Representative will agree to execute and deliver (at the sole cost and expense of the Grantors) all such authorizations and other instruments as shall reasonably be requested by the Applicable 65 ----- Authorized Representative to evidence and confirm any release of Shared Collateral provided for in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. If the Issuer or any Grantor becomes subject to any bankruptcy case, the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement provides that if the Issuer or any Grantor, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of DIP Financing to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties agree that they will not object to any such financing or to the DIP Financing Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the same or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Shared Collateral, unless the Applicable Authorized Representative opposes or objects to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or such use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Shared Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party will subordinate its Liens with respect to such Shared Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any such Shared Collateral granted to secure the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations of the Controlling Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to such Shared Collateral as set forth in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement), in each case so long as: (A) each series of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties retain the benefit of their Liens on all such Shared Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-a-vis all the other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of the bankruptcy case; (B) each series of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties are granted Liens on any additional collateral pledged to any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, with the same priority vis-a-vis the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties as set forth in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement; (C) if any amount of such DIP Financing or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to and in accordance with the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement; and (D) if any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection are applied pursuant to and in accordance with the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement; provided that each series of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties will have a right to object to the grant of a Lien to secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties of such series or its Representative that do not constitute Shared Collateral; and provided, however, that the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties receiving adequate protection shall not object to any other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties in connection with a DIP Financing or use of cash collateral. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holders of each series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations (and not the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties of any other series) will bear the risk of (i) any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (x) any of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations of such series are unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other than another series of Non-ABL Loan/ Notes Obligations), (y) any of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations of such series do not have an enforceable security interest in any of the Collateral securing any other series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations and/or (z) any intervening security interest that may exist securing other obligations (other than another series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the security interest of such series of Non-ABL 66 ----- Loan/Notes Obligations but junior to the security interest of any other series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, (ii) all or any portion of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations of such series constituting Excess Obligations and (iii) the existence of any Collateral for any other series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations that is not Shared Collateral (any such condition referred to in the foregoing clause (i), (ii) or (iii) with respect to any series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, an “Impairment” of such series). In the event of any Impairment with respect to any series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, the results of such Impairment will be borne solely by the holders of such series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations (including the right to receive distributions in respect of such series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations pursuant to the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement) set forth in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will be modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the series of such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations subject to such Impairment. Accordingly, with respect to any Shared Collateral for which a third party (other than a Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party) has a lien or security interest that is junior in priority to the security interest of any series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations but senior (as determined by appropriate legal proceedings in the case of any dispute) to the security interest of any other series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations (such third party, an “Intervening Creditor”), the value of any Shared Collateral or proceeds which are allocated to such Intervening Creditor shall be deducted on a ratable basis solely from the proceeds distributed in respect of the series of such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations subject to such impairment from the Shared Collateral. Additionally, in the event the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations of any series are modified pursuant to applicable law (including pursuant to Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code), any reference to such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations or the Collateral Documents governing such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations will refer to such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations or such documents as so modified.",,as_expected,2023,160,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: Intercreditor Agreements\nText: On the Issue Date, the Notes will be subject to two intercreditor agreements: (1) the ABL Intercreditor Agreement and (2) the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. Holders of the Notes will be deemed to have agreed and accepted the terms of the Intercreditor Agreements by their acceptance of the Notes. The Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees will, with certain exceptions, have the benefit of Liens on the Collateral, including after-acquired Collateral, which will consist of (i) first-priority security interests in the Non-ABL Priority Collateral and (ii) second-priority security interests in the ABL Priority Collateral as to which the ABL Facility Secured Parties have a first-priority security interest. See \u201c\u2014Collateral\u2014Description of Collateral.\u201d In addition, the Indenture will provide that in the event that the Issuer or any other Grantor Incurs, in compliance with the Indenture, Indebtedness that is secured by any or all of the Collateral (whether on a juniorpriority or pari passu basis with the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees), the Collateral Agent will, at the request of the Issuer, enter into (i) in the case of such Indebtedness so secured on a junior-priority basis, one or more intercreditor agreements reasonably acceptable to the Collateral Agent or (ii) in the case of such Indebtedness so secured on a pari passu basis, an amendment or supplement to each applicable Intercreditor Agreement with terms that are reasonably acceptable to the Collateral Agent, in each case, with the Representative of such Indebtedness and any other applicable Representatives of Obligations. 57 ----- BY ACCEPTING A NOTE EACH HOLDER SHALL BE BOUND BY THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENTS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. ABL Intercreditor Agreement The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will provide, among other things, that: (1) (i) Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral securing the Obligations in respect of the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees will be junior to the Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral securing the ABL Facility Obligations up to the ABL Cap, and consequently, the holders of ABL Facility Obligations will be entitled to receive the proceeds from the disposition of any ABL Priority Collateral prior to the Holders of the Notes and (ii) Liens on the Non-ABL Priority Collateral securing the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations (including the Obligations in respect of Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees) up to the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Cap will be senior to the Liens on the Non-ABL Priority Collateral securing the ABL Facility Obligations, and consequently, holders of the Notes will be entitled to receive the proceeds from the disposition of any Non-ABL Priority Collateral prior to the holders of the ABL Facility Obligations; provided, however, that (x) Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral securing the Obligations in respect of the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees will be senior to the Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral securing any future ABL Facility Obligations in excess of the ABL Cap and (y) Liens on the Non-ABL Priority Collateral securing any future Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Obligations in respect of the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees) in excess of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Cap will be junior to the Liens on the Non-ABL Priority Collateral securing the ABL Facility Obligations (other than any ABL Facility Obligations in excess of the ABL Cap); \u201cABL Cap\u201d shall mean $2,200,000,000; provided, that, if a DIP Financing is provided by an ABL Facility Secured Party in accordance with the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, as described below, the ABL Cap will be $2,420,000,000. \u201cNon-ABL Loan/Notes Cap\u201d shall mean $1,300,000,000 plus the \u201cMaximum Incremental Amount\u201d as such term is defined in the Senior Term Agreement as of May 19, 2021, except for this purpose substituting \u201c$511,500,000\u201d for the \u201c$465,000,000\u201d set forth in clause (i)(a) therein (or, in the event that the Senior Term Agreement is thereafter amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed, restated, refinanced or otherwise replaced, such other comparable term contained in such Senior Term Agreement, so long as the amount under such comparable term does not exceed the amount that would have been the \u201cMaximum Incremental Amount\u201d (as such term is defined in the Senior Term Agreement as of May 19, 2021 and taking into account the substitution provided for above)); provided, that, if a DIP Financing is provided by any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party in accordance with the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, as described below, the Non-ABL Loan/ Notes Cap will be $181,150,000 greater than the amount otherwise provided above. \u201cMaximum Incremental Amount\u201d as defined in the Senior Term Agreement means, at any time, the greater of (i) the excess, if any, of (a) the greater of (1) $465,000,000 and (2) 100% of Consolidated EBITDA for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters of the Issuer ending on or immediately prior to such time for which internal consolidated financial statements of the Issuer are available, over (b) the aggregate amount of all Incremental Term Loan Commitments (as defined in the Senior Term Agreement) established prior to such time pursuant to the Senior Term Agreement and all Incremental Equivalent Debt (as defined in the Senior Term Agreement) incurred or issued prior to such time in accordance with the Senior Term Agreement and (ii) such other amount, so long as, after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of any such Incremental Term Loans (as defined in the Senior Term Agreement) and/or incurrence or issuance of any Incremental Equivalent Debt, as applicable, and certain pro forma adjustments pursuant to the Senior Term Agreement, the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Senior Term Agreement) (calculated as if any Incremental Term Loan Commitment being established were fully drawn) is equal to or less than 3.75 to 1.00. (2) (x) so long as the Discharge of ABL Facility Obligations (as defined below) has not occurred, if the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent or any Holder of the Notes receives any proceeds from the disposition of 58 ----- any ABL Priority Collateral and (y) so long as the Discharge of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations (as defined below) has not occurred, if the ABL Agent or the holder of any ABL Facility Obligations receives any proceeds from the disposition of any Non-ABL Priority Collateral, such proceeds will be turned over to the Applicable Priority Agent entitled to receive such proceeds in accordance with the foregoing; (3) the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent will not contest or support any other Person in contesting, in any proceedings (including any Insolvency Proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity or enforceability of a Lien held by or for the benefit or on behalf of any ABL Facility Secured Party in any Collateral; (4) the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent and the ABL Agent intend that the Collateral securing the ABL Facility Obligations and Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations to be identical (other than the collateral of a Foreign Grantor that is a CFC or of a Grantor which is a FSHCO which, in each case, may secure all or any portion of the ABL Facility Obligations, but not the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations). In furtherance thereof, the ABL Agent and Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent will cooperate in good faith from time to time to determine the specific items of Collateral of the Grantors included in the ABL Priority Collateral and the Non-ABL Priority Collateral and the steps taken to perfect their respective Liens thereon; and (5) certain procedures for enforcing the Liens on the Collateral shall be followed. \u201cDischarge of ABL Facility Obligations\u201d shall mean, subject to the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement: (a) the payment in full in cash of the principal and interest (including any interest which would accrue and become due but for the commencement of an Insolvency Proceeding, whether or not such amounts are allowed or allowable in whole or in part in such case) constituting ABL Facility Obligations; (b) the payment in full in cash of all other ABL Facility Obligations that is due and payable or otherwise accrued and owing at or prior to the time such principal and interest are paid (including any such amounts which would accrue and become due but for the commencement of an Insolvency Proceeding, whether or not such amounts are allowed or allowable in whole or in part in such case), other than obligations described in clause (c) below; (c)(i) the delivery to the ABL Agent, or at the ABL Agent\u2019s option, each Issuing Bank (as such term is defined in the Senior ABL Agreement) of cash collateral, or at the ABL Agent\u2019s option, the delivery to the ABL Agent (or at its option, each Issuing Bank) of a letter of credit payable to the ABL Agent (or at the ABL Agent\u2019s option, such Issuing Bank) issued by a bank reasonably acceptable to the ABL Agent (or if issued to such Issuing Bank, a bank reasonably acceptable to such Issuing Bank) in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the ABL Agent (or if issued to such Issuing Bank, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such Issuing Bank), in either case in respect of letters of credit, banker\u2019s acceptances or similar or related instruments issued under the Senior ABL Agreement and ABL Facility Collateral Documents (in such amount as required by the Senior ABL Agreement and/or ABL Facility Collateral Documents but not to exceed one hundred five percent (105%) of the amount of such letters of credit, banker\u2019s acceptances or similar or related instruments), (ii) the delivery of cash collateral in respect of ABL Bank Product Obligations (as defined in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement) or ABL Hedge Obligations (as defined in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement) owing to any ABL Facility Secured Party (or, at the option of the ABL Facility Secured Party with respect to such ABL Bank Product Obligations or ABL Hedge Obligations, the termination of the applicable Hedge Agreements, ABL Bank Product Agreement (as defined in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement) or cash management or other arrangements and the payment in full in cash of the ABL Facility Obligations due and payable in connection with such termination or the execution and implementation of alternative arrangements satisfactory to the applicable ABL Facility Secured Party), and (iii) the delivery of cash collateral to the ABL Agent, or at the ABL Agent\u2019s option, the delivery to the ABL Agent of a letter of credit payable to the ABL Agent issued by a bank reasonably acceptable to the ABL Agent in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the ABL Agent, in respect of 59 ----- continuing obligations of the ABL Agent and ABL Facility Secured Parties under control agreements and other contingent ABL Facility Obligations for which a claim or demand for payment has been made at such time or in respect of matters or circumstances known to an ABL Facility Secured Party at the time, of which such ABL Facility Secured Party has informed the ABL Agent and which are reasonably expected to result in any loss, cost, damage or expense (including attorneys\u2019 fees and legal expenses) to any ABL Facility Secured Party for which such ABL Facility Secured Party is entitled to indemnification by any Grantor; and (d) the termination of the commitments of the ABL Facility Secured Parties and the financing arrangements provided by the ABL Agent and the ABL Facility Secured Parties to Grantors under the Senior ABL Agreement and/or ABL Facility Collateral Documents. \u201cDischarge of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations\u201d shall mean, subject to the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement: (a) the payment in full in cash of the principal and interest (including any interest which would accrue and become due but for the commencement of an Insolvency Proceeding, whether or not such amounts are allowed or allowable in whole or in part in such case) constituting Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations; (b) the payment in full in cash of all other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations that is due and payable or otherwise accrued and owing at or prior to the time such principal and interest are paid (including any such amounts which would accrue and become due but for the commencement of an Insolvency Proceeding, whether or not such amounts are allowed or allowable in whole or in part in such case), other than obligations described in clause (c) below; (c) the delivery to the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent of cash collateral, or at the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent\u2019s option, the delivery to Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent of a letter of credit payable to the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent issued by a bank reasonably acceptable to the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent, in either case in respect of contingent Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations for which a claim or demand for payment has been made at such time or in respect of matters or circumstances known to a Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party at the time, of which such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party has informed the Designated Term Loan/ Notes Agent and which are reasonably expected to result in any loss, cost, damage or expense (including attorneys\u2019 fees and legal expenses) to any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party for which such Non-ABL Loan/ Notes Secured Party is entitled to indemnification by any Grantor; and (d) the termination of the commitments of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties and the financing arrangements provided by the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties to Grantors under the Non-ABL Loan/ Notes Debt Documents. Pursuant to the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, (x) so long as the ABL Facility Obligations are secured, the ABL Agent will determine the time and method by which the security interests in the ABL Priority Collateral will be enforced and (y) so long as the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations are secured, the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent will determine the time and method by which the security interests in the Non-ABL Priority Collateral will be enforced. The Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent will not be permitted to enforce the security interests on the ABL Priority Collateral even if an Event of Default under the Indenture has occurred and the Notes have been accelerated, except in any bankruptcy or liquidation proceeding as necessary to file a claim or statement of interest with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee and in certain other limited situations. In addition, the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent will be restricted from contesting any enforcement action or proceeding (or forbearance thereof) pursued by the ABL Agent with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral. After the discharge of the Liens securing the ABL Facility Obligations, the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent, acting at the instruction of the Applicable Authorized Representative, in accordance with the provisions of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, will determine the time and method by which its Liens in the ABL Priority 60 ----- Collateral will be enforced and, if applicable, will distribute proceeds (after payment of the costs of enforcement and collateral administration) of the Collateral received by it to the holders of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations in accordance with the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. Conversely, the ABL Agent will not be permitted to enforce the security interests on the Non-ABL Priority Collateral and will be similarly restricted from contesting any enforcement action or proceeding (or forbearance thereof) pursued by the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent with respect to the Non-ABL Priority Collateral until the discharge of the Liens securing the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations. In the event of any sale or other disposition of any ABL Priority Collateral permitted, or consented to by the ABL Agent, under the terms of the Senior ABL Agreement that results in the release of such ABL Agent\u2019s Liens on any ABL Priority Collateral (including any sale or disposition in connection with the exercise by the ABL Agent of its enforcement remedies in respect of such ABL Priority Collateral, but excluding any other sale or disposition that is not permitted by the Indenture and the applicable Notes Collateral Documents), the Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral securing the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations (including the Obligations in respect of the Notes and Subsidiary Guarantees) will be automatically released to the same extent as such ABL Agent\u2019s Lien; provided that the proceeds of any such sale or disposition shall be applied to the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations in accordance with the provisions governing the application of proceeds in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement and the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent will be required to take such actions (and will be deemed to have authorized such actions) as necessary to effect such release. In the event a bankruptcy proceeding shall be commenced by or against the Issuer or any other Grantor and the Applicable Priority Agent shall desire to permit the Issuer or any other Grantor to use cash collateral which constitutes ABL Priority Collateral or Non-ABL Priority Collateral, as applicable, or to enter into certain debtor-in-possession financings (a \u201cDIP Financing\u201d) in such proceeding, the Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral or Non-ABL Priority Collateral, as applicable, may, without any further action or consent by the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent (in the case of ABL Priority Collateral) or the ABL Agent (in the case of Non-ABL Priority Collateral), be made junior and subordinated to Liens granted to secure such DIP Financings (such Liens, \u201cDIP Financing Liens\u201d), to any adequate protection provided to the ABL Facility Secured Parties or Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties, as applicable, and to any \u201ccarve-out\u201d or similar administrative priority expense or claim consented to in writing by the ABL Agent (in the case of ABL Priority Collateral) or the Term Loan Agent, 2026 Secured Notes Collateral Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable (in the case of Non-ABL Priority Collateral), to be paid prior to the Discharge of ABL Facility Obligations or Discharge of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, as applicable, subject to certain conditions. Under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, (x) each of the Term Loan Agent and the Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself and the applicable other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties, will not contest, or support any other Person in contesting (i) any request by the ABL Agent or any of the other ABL Facility Secured Parties for adequate protection with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral or any adequate protection provided to the ABL Agent or any of the other ABL Facility Secured Parties with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral or (ii) any objection by the ABL Agent or any of the other ABL Facility Secured Parties to any motion, relief, action or proceeding based on a claim of a lack of adequate protection with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral; and (y) the ABL Agent will not contest, or support any other Person in contesting (i) any request by the Term Loan Agent, 2026 Secured Notes Collateral Agent, Collateral Agent or any of the other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties for adequate protection with respect to the Non-ABL Priority Collateral or any adequate protection provided to the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent or any of the other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties with respect to the Non-ABL Priority Collateral or (ii) any objection by the Term Loan Agent, 2026 Secured Notes Collateral Agent, Collateral Agent or any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party to any motion, relief, action or proceeding based on a claim of a lack of adequate protection with respect to the Non-ABL Priority Collateral. Under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, the Term Loan Agent, 2026 Secured Notes Collateral Agent and Collateral Agent will only be permitted to seek adequate protection with respect to its security interests in ABL 61 ----- Priority Collateral without the prior written consent of the ABL Facility Secured Parties in limited circumstances. For example, if any or all of the ABL Facility Secured Parties are granted adequate protection in the form of additional collateral or a super-priority claim in connection with the use of cash collateral which constitutes ABL Priority Collateral or a DIP Financing or in connection with any Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral and such additional collateral is the type of asset or property that would constitute ABL Priority Collateral, then (A) each of the Term Loan Agent, 2026 Secured Notes Collateral Agent and the Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself or any of the applicable Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties, may seek or request adequate protection in the form of a Lien or super-priority claim on such additional collateral, which Lien or claim will be subordinated to the Liens securing the ABL Facility Obligations and such use of cash collateral constituting ABL Priority Collateral or DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto) on the same basis as the other Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral securing the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations are so subordinated to the Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral securing the ABL Facility Obligations under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement. The ABL Agent will be similarly limited in its ability to seek adequate protection with respect to its security interests in the Non-ABL Priority Collateral without the prior written consent of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will also limit the right of the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent and the other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties to seek relief from or modification of the \u201cautomatic stay\u201d in respect of the ABL Priority Collateral. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent may not assert any right of marshalling, appraisal, valuation or other similar right that may be available under applicable law with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral. Until the Discharge of ABL Facility Obligations has occurred, in the event of any bankruptcy or liquidation proceeding, the Designated Term Loan/ Notes Agent and the other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties will not be permitted to object or oppose (or support any Person in objecting or opposing) a motion with respect to any sale, lease, license, exchange, transfer or other disposition of any ABL Priority Collateral free and clear of the Liens of the Designated Term Loan/ Notes Agent and the other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties or other claims under Section 363 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the \u201cBankruptcy Code\u201d), or any comparable provision of any bankruptcy law and shall be deemed to have consented to any such sale, lease, license, exchange, transfer or other disposition of any ABL Priority Collateral under Section 363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code that has been consented to by the ABL Agent; provided, that the proceeds of such sale, lease, license, exchange, transfer or other disposition of any ABL Priority Collateral shall be applied to the ABL Facility Obligations or the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations in accordance with the provisions governing the application of proceeds in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement or, if not so applied, the Liens of the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent or ABL Agent, as applicable, shall attach to the proceeds of such disposition subject to the relative priorities set forth in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will also limit the right of the ABL Agent and the other ABL Facility Secured Parties to seek relief from or modification of the \u201cautomatic stay\u201d in respect of the Non-ABL Priority Collateral. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides that the ABL Agent may not assert any right of marshalling, appraisal, valuation or other similar right that may be available under applicable law with respect to the Non-ABL Priority Collateral. Until the Discharge of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations has occurred, in the event of any bankruptcy or liquidation proceeding, the ABL Agent and the other ABL Facility Secured Parties will not be permitted to object or oppose (or support any Person in objecting or opposing) a motion with respect to any sale, lease, license, exchange, transfer or other disposition of any Non-ABL Priority Collateral free and clear of the Liens of the ABL Agent and the other ABL Facility Secured Parties or other claims under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, or any comparable provision of any bankruptcy law and shall be deemed to have consented to any such sale, lease, license, exchange, transfer or other disposition of any Non-ABL Priority Collateral under Section 363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code that has been consented to by the Designated Term Loan/ Notes Agent; provided, that the proceeds of such sale, lease, license, exchange, transfer or other disposition of any Non-ABL Priority Collateral shall be applied to the ABL Facility Obligations or the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations in accordance with the provisions governing the application of proceeds in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement or, if not so applied, the Liens of the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent or ABL Agent, as applicable, shall attach to the proceeds of such disposition subject to the relative priorities set forth in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement. 62 ----- Under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, each of the Term Loan Agent, 2026 Secured Notes Collateral Agent and Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the other applicable Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties, waives any claim any such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party may hereafter have against any ABL Facility Secured Party arising out of the election by any ABL Facility Secured Party of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, or any comparable provision of any other bankruptcy law, with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral. The ABL Agent, for itself and on behalf of the ABL Facility Secured Parties with respect to which the ABL Agent is acting as agent, will make a corresponding waiver with respect to any claim the ABL Facility Secured Parties may have had arising out of any such election by any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party with respect to the Non-ABL Priority Collateral. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will also provide that neither the ABL Agent nor any other ABL Facility Secured Party will oppose or seek to challenge any claim by the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent or any other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party for allowance in any Insolvency Proceeding of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations consisting of Post-Petition Interest to the extent of the value of any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party\u2019s Lien. In addition, neither the Designated Term Loan/Notes Agent nor any other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party will oppose or seek to challenge any claim by the ABL Agent or any other ABL Facility Secured Party for allowance in any Insolvency Proceeding of ABL Facility Obligations consisting of Post-Petition Interest to the extent of the value of any ABL Facility Secured Party\u2019s Lien. Under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, on or after the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the Senior ABL Agreement and the acceleration of all ABL Facility Obligations, including the commencement of an Insolvency Proceeding as to the Grantors that constitute such event of default (each a \u201cNon-ABL Loan/Notes Purchase Event\u201d), one or more of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties will have the option, for a period of ten Business Days after the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Purchase Event, to purchase all (but not less than all) of the ABL Facility Obligations from the ABL Facility Secured Parties. Any such purchasing Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties will be required on the date of purchase to (i) pay to the ABL Agent for the account of the ABL Facility Secured Parties as the purchase price therefor, the full amount of all ABL Facility Obligations then outstanding and unpaid (including principal at par and interest) and (ii) furnish cash collateral to the ABL Agent in such amounts as are required by the Senior ABL Agreement in connection with any issued and outstanding letters of credit, banker\u2019s acceptances or similar or related instruments (but not in any event in an amount greater than one hundred five percent (105%) of the aggregate undrawn face amount of such letters of credit, banker\u2019s acceptances and similar or related instruments). The ABL Facility Secured Parties will have a corresponding purchase option in respect of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations. Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement The rights and obligations of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement described below will be subject to the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement to the extent applicable. Generally, \u201cShared Collateral\u201d means, at any time, Collateral in which the holders of two or more classes of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations (or their authorized Representatives) hold a valid and perfected security interest. Under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders of the Notes will be represented by the Trustee, the Term Loan Secured Parties will be represented by the Term Loan Agent, the 2026 Secured Notes Secured Parties will be represented by the 2026 Secured Notes Trustee and the holders of each class of Additional Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations will be represented by their respective Representative(s). The Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the priorities and other relative rights among the Holders and the holders of other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations (including the Term Loan Secured Parties and 2026 Secured Notes Secured Parties), including, among other things, that: (1) notwithstanding the date, time, method, manner or order of grant, attachment or perfection of any Liens on the Shared Collateral securing any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, the Liens securing all such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations shall be of equal priority; and 63 ----- (2) any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations may be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended or modified from time to time, in each case, to the extent permitted by the Indenture, the Senior Term Agreement, the 2026 Secured Notes Indenture and any other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Debt Documents, without affecting the relative priority with respect to other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations or the relative rights under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. The Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will also provide that only the \u201cApplicable Authorized Representative\u201d has the right to direct foreclosures and take other actions with respect to the Shared Collateral and that none of the other holders of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations or representatives in respect thereof will have any right to direct foreclosures or take such other actions. The Term Loan Agent will be the Applicable Authorized Representative until the earlier of (i) the date that all Obligations in respect of the Senior Term Agreement are no longer secured by the Shared Collateral and (ii) the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date (such earlier date, the \u201cApplicable Authorized Agent Date\u201d). At all times following the Applicable Authorized Agent Date, the Applicable Authorized Representative will be the Representative of the series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations (other than the Term Loan Obligations) that at such time constitutes the largest outstanding principal amount of any then-outstanding series of Non-ABL Loan/ Notes Obligations. The \u201cNon-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date\u201d is the date that is 180 days (throughout which 180-day period the Representative that is to replace the Applicable Authorized Representative was the Representative of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations that constitute the largest outstanding principal amount of any then-outstanding series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations (other than the Term Loan Obligations) (the \u201cMajor Non-Controlling Authorized Representative\u201d)) after the occurrence of both (a) an event of default under the terms of that class of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations and (b) the Trustee\u2019s and each other Representative\u2019s receipt of written notice from that Representative certifying that (i) such Representative is the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative and that an event of default with respect to such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations has occurred and is continuing and (ii) such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of the agreement governing those Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations; provided, however, that the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be stayed and shall not occur and shall be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Shared Collateral (1) at any time the Applicable Collateral Agent or the Applicable Authorized Representative has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to such Shared Collateral or (2) at any time the Issuer or any other Grantor that has granted a security interest in such Shared Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. \u201cApplicable Collateral Agent\u201d means (i) prior to the Applicable Authorized Agent Date, the Term Loan Agent, (ii) following the Applicable Authorized Agent Date, at any time the Trustee is the Applicable Authorized Representative, the Collateral Agent and (iii) following the Applicable Authorized Agent Date, at any time the Trustee is not the Applicable Authorized Representative, the collateral agent designated by the Applicable Authorized Representative. The Applicable Authorized Representative under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will have the sole right to instruct the Applicable Collateral Agent to act or refrain from acting with respect to the Shared Collateral, and the Applicable Collateral Agent will not follow any instructions with respect to such Shared Collateral from any other Person. No Representative of any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations or other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party (other than the Applicable Authorized Representative) will be entitled to instruct the Applicable Collateral Agent to commence any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its security interests in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, the Shared Collateral. 64 ----- Subject to the foregoing, notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens, the Applicable Collateral Agent, acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative, may deal with the Shared Collateral as if such Applicable Collateral Agent had a senior Lien on such Shared Collateral. No Representative of any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations or Non-Controlling Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party (other than the Applicable Authorized Representative) may contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Applicable Authorized Representative, a Controlling Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party or the Applicable Collateral Agent (acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative). The Trustee and each other Representative will agree that it will not accept any Lien on any Collateral for the benefit of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties (other than funds deposited for the discharge or defeasance of any Non-ABL Loan/ Notes Obligation or cash collateral in connection with a letter of credit or in connection with the obligations of a defaulting lender) other than pursuant to the Collateral Documents. Each holder of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, including the Holders by acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have agreed that it will not contest or support any other Person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any other holder of such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations in all or any part of the Collateral, or any of the provisions of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. If an event of default has occurred and is continuing under any documentation evidencing or governing any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations and the Applicable Collateral Agent or any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Shared Collateral, any distribution is made with respect to any Shared Collateral in any bankruptcy case of the Issuer or any Grantor and any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party receives any payment pursuant to any Intercreditor Agreement (other than the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Shared Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Collateral by the Applicable Collateral Agent or any other holder of such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations and proceeds of any such distribution, as applicable, will be applied among the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations to the payment in full of such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations on a ratable basis, after payment of all amounts owing to the Applicable Collateral Agent and the other Representatives, in their capacities as such. None of the holders of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations may institute any suit or assert in any suit, bankruptcy, insolvency or other proceeding any claim against the Applicable Collateral Agent or any other holder of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Collateral. In addition, none of the holders of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations may seek to have any Shared Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. None of the Applicable Collateral Agent, any Applicable Authorized Representative or any other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Applicable Collateral Agent, such Applicable Authorized Representative or other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party with respect to any Shared Collateral in accordance with the provisions of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. If any holder of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations obtains possession of any Shared Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof, in each case, as a result of the enforcement of remedies, at any time prior to the discharge of each of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, then it must hold such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other holders of Non-ABL Loan/ Notes Obligations and promptly transfer such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Applicable Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the Collateral Documents. If, at any time the Applicable Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Shared Collateral, then (whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of each series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released and discharged; provided that any proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom shall be allocated and applied pursuant to and in accordance with the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. The Applicable Collateral Agent and each Representative will agree to execute and deliver (at the sole cost and expense of the Grantors) all such authorizations and other instruments as shall reasonably be requested by the Applicable 65 ----- Authorized Representative to evidence and confirm any release of Shared Collateral provided for in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. If the Issuer or any Grantor becomes subject to any bankruptcy case, the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement provides that if the Issuer or any Grantor, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of DIP Financing to be provided by one or more lenders (the \u201cDIP Lenders\u201d) under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties agree that they will not object to any such financing or to the DIP Financing Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the same or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Shared Collateral, unless the Applicable Authorized Representative opposes or objects to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or such use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Shared Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party will subordinate its Liens with respect to such Shared Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any such Shared Collateral granted to secure the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations of the Controlling Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to such Shared Collateral as set forth in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement), in each case so long as: (A) each series of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties retain the benefit of their Liens on all such Shared Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-a-vis all the other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of the bankruptcy case; (B) each series of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties are granted Liens on any additional collateral pledged to any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, with the same priority vis-a-vis the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties as set forth in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement; (C) if any amount of such DIP Financing or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to and in accordance with the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement; and (D) if any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection are applied pursuant to and in accordance with the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement; provided that each series of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties will have a right to object to the grant of a Lien to secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties of such series or its Representative that do not constitute Shared Collateral; and provided, however, that the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties receiving adequate protection shall not object to any other Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties in connection with a DIP Financing or use of cash collateral. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holders of each series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations (and not the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Parties of any other series) will bear the risk of (i) any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (x) any of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations of such series are unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other than another series of Non-ABL Loan/ Notes Obligations), (y) any of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations of such series do not have an enforceable security interest in any of the Collateral securing any other series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations and/or (z) any intervening security interest that may exist securing other obligations (other than another series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the security interest of such series of Non-ABL 66 ----- Loan/Notes Obligations but junior to the security interest of any other series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, (ii) all or any portion of the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations of such series constituting Excess Obligations and (iii) the existence of any Collateral for any other series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations that is not Shared Collateral (any such condition referred to in the foregoing clause (i), (ii) or (iii) with respect to any series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, an \u201cImpairment\u201d of such series). In the event of any Impairment with respect to any series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, the results of such Impairment will be borne solely by the holders of such series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations (including the right to receive distributions in respect of such series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations pursuant to the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement) set forth in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will be modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the series of such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations subject to such Impairment. Accordingly, with respect to any Shared Collateral for which a third party (other than a Non-ABL Loan/Notes Secured Party) has a lien or security interest that is junior in priority to the security interest of any series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations but senior (as determined by appropriate legal proceedings in the case of any dispute) to the security interest of any other series of Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations (such third party, an \u201cIntervening Creditor\u201d), the value of any Shared Collateral or proceeds which are allocated to such Intervening Creditor shall be deducted on a ratable basis solely from the proceeds distributed in respect of the series of such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations subject to such impairment from the Shared Collateral. Additionally, in the event the Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations of any series are modified pursuant to applicable law (including pursuant to Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code), any reference to such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations or the Collateral Documents governing such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations will refer to such Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations or such documents as so modified.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}",,,

1108,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,238,DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS,238.16,Collateral,238.16.7,Certain Bankruptcy Limitations,"In addition to the limitations described above, the right of a Priority Agent, including the Collateral Agent, as applicable, to obtain possession, exercise control over or dispose of the Collateral following an Event of Default is likely to be significantly impaired by applicable bankruptcy law if the Issuer or any other Grantor were to have become a debtor under the Bankruptcy Code prior to such Priority Agent having obtained possession, exercised control over or disposed of the Collateral. Upon the commencement of a case for relief under the Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor is prohibited by the automatic stay from obtaining possession of its collateral from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from exercising control over or disposing of collateral taken from such debtor, without bankruptcy court approval. Moreover, the Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor in certain circumstances to continue to retain and to use collateral owned as of the date of the bankruptcy filing (and the proceeds, products, offspring, rents or profits of such collateral) even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments; provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The term “adequate protection” is not defined in the Bankruptcy Code, but it can include making periodic cash payments, providing an additional or replacement Lien or granting other relief, in each case to the extent that the collateral decreases in value during the pendency of the bankruptcy case as a result of, among other things, the imposition of the automatic stay, the use, sale or lease of such collateral or any grant of a “priming lien” in connection with DIP Financing. The type of adequate protection provided to a secured creditor will vary according to the circumstances. In view of the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict whether or when the Collateral Agent could repossess or dispose of the Collateral, or whether or to what extent Holders would be compensated for any delay in payment or decrease in value of the Collateral through the requirement of “adequate protection.” In addition, as described under “—Collateral—Intercreditor Agreements,” pursuant to the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, Holders and the Collateral Agent are restricted on the type of adequate protection provided to such Holders and the Collateral Agent. Furthermore, in the event a bankruptcy court determines the value of the Collateral (after giving effect to any prior or pari passu Liens) is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the Holders would hold secured claims only to the extent of the value of the Collateral (after giving effect to any prior or pari passu Liens) and would hold unsecured claims with respect to any shortfall. Under the Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor’s claim includes Post-Petition Interest, costs or charges provided for under the agreement under which such claim arose only if and to the extent the claims are oversecured. In addition, if the Issuer or any other Grantor were to become the subject of a bankruptcy case, the bankruptcy court, among other things, may void certain prepetition transfers made by the entity that is the subject of the bankruptcy filing, including, without limitation, transfers held to be preferences or fraudulent conveyances. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Federal and state statutes may allow courts, under specific circumstances, to void the notes, the guarantees or the security interests, subordinate claims in respect of the notes, the guarantees or the security interests and/or require noteholders to return payments received from us or the guarantors.” In the event the Issuer or any other Grantor becomes a debtor in a bankruptcy case, the Issuer or such other Grantor may enter into DIP Financing in such case. As a result of such DIP Financing, the Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees may, without any further action or consent by the Trustee, the Collateral Agent or the Holders, be made junior and subordinated to such DIP Financing Liens so long as the Issuer or the applicable other Grantor can show that (i) it could not obtain credit otherwise and (ii) there is adequate protection of the interest of the holder of the Lien on the assets on which such priming Lien is proposed to be granted. In addition, as described under “—Collateral—Intercreditor Agreements,” pursuant to the 68 ----- Intercreditor Agreements, Holders will not be permitted to object to certain DIP Financings and may be required to subordinate their Liens in connection with certain DIP Financings.

Furthermore, in the event a bankruptcy court determines the value of the Collateral (after giving effect to any prior or pari passu Liens) is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the Holders would hold secured claims only to the extent of the value of the Collateral (after giving effect to any prior or pari passu Liens) and would hold unsecured claims with respect to any shortfall. Under the Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor\u2019s claim includes Post-Petition Interest, costs or charges provided for under the agreement under which such claim arose only if and to the extent the claims are oversecured. In addition, if the Issuer or any other Grantor were to become the subject of a bankruptcy case, the bankruptcy court, among other things, may void certain prepetition transfers made by the entity that is the subject of the bankruptcy filing, including, without limitation, transfers held to be preferences or fraudulent conveyances. See \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes\u2014Federal and state statutes may allow courts, under specific circumstances, to void the notes, the guarantees or the security interests, subordinate claims in respect of the notes, the guarantees or the security interests and/or require noteholders to return payments received from us or the guarantors.\u201d In the event the Issuer or any other Grantor becomes a debtor in a bankruptcy case, the Issuer or such other Grantor may enter into DIP Financing in such case. As a result of such DIP Financing, the Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees may, without any further action or consent by the Trustee, the Collateral Agent or the Holders, be made junior and subordinated to such DIP Financing Liens so long as the Issuer or the applicable other Grantor can show that (i) it could not obtain credit otherwise and (ii) there is adequate protection of the interest of the holder of the Lien on the assets on which such priming Lien is proposed to be granted. In addition, as described under \u201c\u2014Collateral\u2014Intercreditor Agreements,\u201d pursuant to the 68 ----- Intercreditor Agreements, Holders will not be permitted to object to certain DIP Financings and may be required to subordinate their Liens in connection with certain DIP Financings. See \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes\u2014Bankruptcy laws may limit the ability of holders of the notes to realize value from the Collateral.\u201d\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}",,,

1108,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,238,DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS,238.17,"We do not intend to qualify the Indenture under the TIA and, therefore, the Issuer will not need to comply with TIA Section 313(b), relating to reports, and TIA Section 314(d), relating to the release of property or securities or relating to the substitution therefor of any property or securities to be subjected to the Lien of the Notes Collateral Documents. Change of Control",238.17.1,,"Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below), unless the Issuer has prior to or substantially concurrent with the time the Issuer is required to make a Change of Control Offer (as defined below) pursuant to the third paragraph of this covenant delivered a redemption notice with respect to all of the outstanding Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption”, each Holder of Notes will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part of such Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101.0% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), in accordance with the terms contemplated by the third paragraph of this covenant. The term “Change of Control” means the occurrence of any of the following: (i) any “person” or “group” (as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) becomes the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50.0% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of Beacon; or (ii) Beacon merges or consolidates with or into, or sells or transfers (in one or a series of related transactions) all or substantially all of the assets of Beacon and its Restricted Subsidiaries to, another Person and any “person” or “group” (as defined in clause (i) above) is or becomes the “beneficial owner” (as so defined), directly or indirectly, of more than 50.0% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the surviving Person in such merger or consolidation, or the transferee Person in such sale or transfer of assets, as the case may be. Unless the Issuer has prior to or substantially concurrent with the time the Issuer is required to make a Change of Control Offer pursuant to this paragraph delivered a redemption notice with respect to all of the outstanding Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Issuer shall, not later than 30 days following the date the Issuer obtains actual knowledge of any Change of Control having occurred, mail or otherwise deliver in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC a notice (a “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder with a copy to the Trustee stating: (1) that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has, or upon such occurrence will have, the right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101.0% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); (2) the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed or otherwise delivered); (3) the instructions determined by the Issuer, consistent with this covenant, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and (4) if such notice is mailed or otherwise delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, that such offer is conditioned on the occurrence of such Change of Control. No Note will be repurchased in part if less than the Minimum Denomination in principal amount of such Note would be left outstanding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, the Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. The Change of Control provisions described above may deter certain mergers, tender offers and other takeover attempts involving Beacon by increasing the capital required to effectuate such transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement that if fully performed would result in a Change of Control is in effect at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. 70 ----- If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Company, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Company as described in the second preceding paragraph, repurchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Company or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice; provided that such notice is given not more than 30 days following such repurchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such repurchase at a price in cash equal to 101.0% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Redemption Date. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this covenant by virtue of its compliance with such securities laws or regulations. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between Beacon and the initial purchasers. Beacon has no present plans to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that Beacon could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, Beacon could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect Beacon’s capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on the ability of Beacon to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions can only be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The occurrence of a Change of Control would constitute a default under each Senior Credit Agreement. Agreements governing Indebtedness of the Company may contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased or repaid upon a Change of Control. Each Senior Credit Agreement prohibits, and agreements governing Indebtedness of the Company Incurred after the Issue Date may also prohibit, the Company from repurchasing the Notes upon a Change of Control unless such Indebtedness has been repurchased or repaid (or an offer made to effect such repurchase or repayment has been made and the Indebtedness of the holders of such Indebtedness accepting such offer has been repurchased or repaid) and/or other specified requirements have been met. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Company to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such agreements, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Company and its Subsidiaries. If the Company experiences a Change of Control that triggers a default under such agreements, the Company could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance such Indebtedness. In the event the Company does not obtain such a waiver or does not refinance such Indebtedness, such default could result in such Indebtedness being declared due and payable. Finally, the Company’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Company’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—We may not be able to finance a change of control offer required by the New Indenture or the Existing Indentures.” The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes. As described above under “—Optional Redemption,” the Company also has the right to redeem the Notes at specified prices, in whole or in part, upon a Change of Control or otherwise. The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the sale or other transfer of “all or substantially all” of the assets of Beacon and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Although there is a developing body of 71 ----- case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of Beacon and its Restricted Subsidiaries and therefore it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether the Holders of the Notes have the right to require the Company to repurchase such Notes.",,as_expected,2023,160,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: nan\nText: Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below), unless the Issuer has prior to or substantially concurrent with the time the Issuer is required to make a Change of Control Offer (as defined below) pursuant to the third paragraph of this covenant delivered a redemption notice with respect to all of the outstanding Notes as described under \u201c\u2014Optional Redemption\u201d, each Holder of Notes will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part of such Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101.0% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), in accordance with the terms contemplated by the third paragraph of this covenant.

If on any date subsequent to a date on which any covenants have been suspended pursuant to the first paragraph under “—Suspension of Covenants” one or more of the Rating Agencies downgrade the ratings assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating resulting in the Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Rating from at least two of the three Rating Agencies, all of the Suspended Covenants will be reinstated as of and from the date of such rating decline (any such date, a “Reversion Date”), subject to the Company obtaining the requisite ratings set forth in the first paragraph above under “—Suspension of Covenants” at a subsequent date. The period of time between the suspension of covenants pursuant to the first paragraph under “—Suspension of Covenants” and the Reversion Date is referred to as the “Suspension Period”.

(xiii) payments by the Company pursuant to the CD&R Preferred Stock Repurchase Agreement; and (xiv) the declaration and payment of additional Restricted Payments; provided that both before and after giving pro forma effect to any such Restricted Payment and the incurrence of any Indebtedness in connection therewith, the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio is less than or equal to 4.00:1.00. provided that (A) in the case of clauses (ii), (v), (vi) and (xiv), the net amount of any such Permitted Payment shall be included in subsequent calculations of the amount of Restricted Payments, (B) in the case of clause (iv), at the time of any calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments, the net amount of Permitted Payments that have then actually been made under clause (iv) that is in excess of 50.0% of the total amount of Permitted Payments then permitted under clause (iv) shall be included in such calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments, (C) in all cases other than pursuant to clauses (A) and (B) of this proviso, the net amount of any such Permitted Payment shall be excluded in subsequent calculations of the amount of Restricted Payments, and (D) solely with respect to clauses (v), (xiii) and (xiv), no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of any such Permitted Payment after giving effect thereto. The Company, in its sole discretion, may classify or reclassify any Investment or other Restricted Payment as being made in part under one of the clauses or subclauses of this covenant (or, in the case of any Investment, the clauses or subclauses of Permitted Investments) and in part under one or more other such clauses or subclauses (or, as applicable, clauses or subclauses). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Indenture shall restrict the repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value of the Notes, the 2026 Secured Notes or the 2029 Unsecured Notes, including any call premium paid in connection therewith. Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries. The Indenture will provide that the Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to (i) pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or 79 ----- pay any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Company, (ii) make any loans or advances to the Company or (iii) transfer any of its property or assets to the Company (provided that dividend or liquidation priority between classes of Capital Stock, or subordination of any obligation (including the application of any remedy bars thereto) to any other obligation, will not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction), in each case except any encumbrance or restriction: (1) pursuant to an agreement or instrument in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date, any Credit Facility, the Indenture, the Notes Collateral Documents, the 2026 Secured Notes Indenture, the 2029 Unsecured Notes Indenture, the Notes, the 2026 Secured Notes, the 2029 Unsecured Notes, any Subsidiary Guarantee, any Guarantee of the 2026 Secured Notes or any Guarantee of the 2029 Unsecured Notes;

provided that for purposes of this clause (2), if a Person other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary is the successor company with respect thereto, any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed, as the case may be, by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, when such Person becomes such successor company; (3) pursuant to an agreement or instrument (a “Refinancing Agreement”) effecting a refinancing of Indebtedness Incurred or outstanding pursuant or relating to, or that otherwise extends, renews, refunds, modifies or replaces, any agreement or instrument referred to in clauses (1) or (2) of this covenant or this clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or that is, or is contained in, any amendment, supplement or other modification to an Initial Agreement or Refinancing Agreement (an “Amendment”); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such Refinancing Agreement or Amendment taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders of the Notes than encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such Refinancing Agreement or Amendment relates (as determined in good faith by the Company); (4) (A) pursuant to any agreement or instrument that restricts in a customary manner the assignment or transfer thereof, or the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or asset subject thereto, (B) by virtue of any transfer of, agreement to transfer, option or right with respect to, or Lien on, any property or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture, (C) contained in mortgages, pledges or other security agreements securing Indebtedness or other obligations of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary to the extent restricting the transfer of the property or assets subject thereto, (D) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, (E) pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations that impose encumbrances or restrictions on the property or assets so acquired, (F) on cash or other deposits, net worth or inventory imposed by customers or suppliers under agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business, (G) pursuant to customary provisions contained in agreements and instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business (including leases and licenses) in joint venture and other similar agreements or in shareholder, partnership, limited liability company and other similar agreements in respect of non-wholly owned Restricted Subsidiaries, (H) that arises or is agreed to in the ordinary course of business and does not detract from the value of property or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in any manner material to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, (I) pursuant to Hedging Obligations or Bank Products Obligations, (J) customary net worth provisions contained in real property leases entered into by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, so long as the Company has determined in good faith that such net worth provisions could not reasonably be expected to impair the ability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries to meet their ongoing obligations and (K) pursuant to any agreement providing for the subordination of Subordinated Obligations pursuant to the definition thereof; 80 ----- (5) with respect to any agreement for the direct or indirect disposition of Capital Stock, property or assets of any Person, imposing restrictions with respect to such Person, Capital Stock, property or assets pending the closing of such sale or disposition; (6) by reason of any applicable law, rule, regulation or order, or required by any regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or any of their businesses, including any such law, rule, regulation, order or requirement applicable in connection with such Restricted Subsidiary’s status (or the status of any Subsidiary of such Restricted Subsidiary) as a Captive Insurance Subsidiary; or (7) pursuant to an agreement or instrument (A) relating to any Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” (i) if the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders of the Notes than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreements (as determined in good faith by the Company) or (ii) if such encumbrance or restriction is not materially more disadvantageous to the Holders of the Notes than is customary in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Company) and either (x) the Company determines in good faith that such encumbrance or restriction will not materially affect the Company’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes or (y) such encumbrance or restriction applies only if a default occurs in respect of a payment or financial covenant relating to such Indebtedness, (B) relating to any sale of receivables by or Indebtedness of a Foreign Subsidiary or (C) relating to Indebtedness of or a Financing Disposition by or to or in favor of any Special Purpose Entity. Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock. The Indenture will provide as follows: (a) The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, make any Asset Disposition unless: (i) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary receives consideration (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at the time of such Asset Disposition at least equal to the fair market value of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition, as such fair market value may be determined (and shall be determined, to the extent such Asset Disposition or any series of related Asset Dispositions involves aggregate consideration in excess of the greater of $50 million and 1.0% of Consolidated Total Assets) in good faith by the Company, whose determination shall be conclusive (including as to the value of all non-cash consideration), such determination being made on the date of contractual agreement to such Asset Disposition; (ii) in the case of any Asset Disposition (or series of related Asset Dispositions) having a fair market value of $50 million or more, at least 75.0% of the consideration therefor (excluding, in the case of an Asset Disposition (or series of related Asset Dispositions), any consideration by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, that are not Indebtedness) received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash; and (iii) an amount equal to 100.0% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied by the Company (or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) as follows: (A) first, either (x) to the extent the Company elects (or is required by the terms of any Senior-Priority Obligations (including Credit Facility Indebtedness), any Senior Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor or any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor), to prepay, repay or purchase any such Indebtedness or (in the case of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments) cash collateralize any such Indebtedness (in each case other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) within 365 days after the later of the date of such Asset Disposition and the date of receipt of such Net Available Cash, provided that in addition to the foregoing, the Net Available 81 ----- Cash from an Asset Disposition of Collateral may not be applied to prepay or repay or purchase any Indebtedness other than Senior-Priority Obligations, or (y) to the extent the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary with an amount equal to Net Available Cash received by the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary) within 365 days from the later of the date of such Asset Disposition and the date of receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided that the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will be deemed to have complied with the provisions described in subclause (y) of this paragraph if and to the extent that, within 365 days after the later of the Asset Disposition that generated such Net Available Cash and the date of receipt of such Net Available Cash, the Company has entered into a binding agreement to invest in such Additional Assets with the good faith expectation that such Net Available Cash will be applied to satisfy such provisions (an “Acceptable Commitment”), and that investment is thereafter completed within 180 days after the end of such 365-day period, or in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Net Available Cash is applied in connection therewith, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary has entered into another Acceptable Commitment (a “Second Commitment”) within 180 days of such cancellation or termination and such Net Available Cash is actually applied in such manner within 180 days from the date of the Second Commitment, it being understood that if a Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Available Cash is applied, then such Net Available Cash shall constitute Excess Proceeds (as defined below); (B) second, to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with clause (A) above (such balance, the “Excess Proceeds”), to make an offer to purchase Notes and (to the extent the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, or is required by the terms thereof) to purchase, redeem, prepay or repay any other Senior-Priority Obligations and any other Senior Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (provided that the Excess Proceeds from an Asset Disposition of Collateral may only be applied to purchase, redeem, prepay or repay any Senior Indebtedness other than Senior-Priority Obligations after all such Senior-Priority Obligations have been paid in full), pursuant and subject to the conditions of the Indenture and the agreements governing such other Indebtedness; and (C) third, to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with clauses (A) and (B) above, to fund (to the extent consistent with any other applicable provision of the Indenture) any general corporate purpose (including the repurchase, repayment or other acquisition or retirement of any Subordinated Obligations); provided, however, that in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to clauses (A)(x) or (B) above, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the related loan commitment (if any) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased; provided further, however, that pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with clauses (A) or (B) above, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary may temporarily invest such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture; and (iv) if such Asset Disposition involves the disposition of Collateral, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary has complied with the applicable provisions of the Indenture and the Notes Collateral Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this covenant, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries shall not be required to apply any Net Available Cash or equivalent amount in accordance with this covenant except to the extent that the aggregate Net Available Cash from all Asset Dispositions or equivalent amount that is not applied in accordance with this covenant exceeds $25 million. Subject in all respects to the requirements of clause (iii)(B) of paragraph (a) of this covenant, if the aggregate principal amount of Notes and/or other Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary validly tendered and not withdrawn (or otherwise 82 ----- subject to purchase, redemption or repayment) in connection with an offer pursuant to and in accordance with clause (iii)(B) of paragraph (a) of this covenant exceeds the Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds will be apportioned between such Notes and such other Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, with the portion of the Excess Proceeds payable in respect of such Notes to equal the lesser of (x) the Excess Proceeds amount multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the outstanding principal amount of such Notes and the denominator of which is the sum of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes and the outstanding principal amount of the relevant other Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, and (y) the aggregate principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn. For the purposes of clause (ii) of paragraph (a) of this covenant, the following are deemed to be cash: (1) Temporary Cash Investments and Cash Equivalents; (2) the assumption of Indebtedness of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock of the Company) or any Restricted Subsidiary and the release of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on payment of the principal amount of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; (3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of the principal amount of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; (4) securities received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition; (5) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; (6) Additional Assets; and (7) any Designated Noncash Consideration received by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in an Asset Disposition having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated Noncash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (7), not to exceed an aggregate amount at any time outstanding equal to the greater of $175 million and 2.5% of Consolidated Total Assets (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Noncash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value). (b) In the event of an Asset Disposition that requires the purchase of Notes pursuant to and in accordance with clause (iii)(B) of paragraph (a) of this covenant, the Company will be required to purchase Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to an offer by the Company for the Notes (the “Offer”) at a purchase price of 100.0% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of purchase in accordance with the procedures (including prorating in the event of oversubscription) set forth in the Indenture. If the aggregate purchase price of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer is less than the Net Available Cash allotted to the purchase of Notes, the remaining Net Available Cash will be available to the Company for use in accordance with clause (iii)(B) of paragraph (a) of this covenant (to repay other Senior Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) or clause (iii)(C) of paragraph (a) of this covenant, and the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. The Company will not be required to make an Offer for Notes pursuant to this covenant if the Net Available Cash available therefor (after application of the proceeds as provided in clause (iii)(A) of paragraph (a) of this covenant) is less than $50 million for any particular Asset Disposition (which lesser amounts shall be carried forward for purposes of determining whether an Offer is required with respect to the Net Available Cash from any subsequent Asset Disposition), and the Company will commence such Offer within 20 days after such Net Available Cash equals or exceeds $50 million. No Note will be purchased in part if less than the Minimum Denomination in principal amount of such Note would be left outstanding. (c) The Company will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the purchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this covenant, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this covenant by virtue of its compliance with such securities laws or regulations. Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates. The Indenture will provide as follows: 83 ----- (a) The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Company (an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate consideration in excess of $15 million unless (i) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction are not materially less favorable to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained at the time in a transaction with a Person who is not an Affiliate of the Company and (ii) if such Affiliate Transaction involves aggregate consideration in excess of $75 million, the terms of such Affiliate Transaction have been approved by a majority of the Board of Directors. Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in this paragraph (a) if (x) such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors or (y) in the event there are no Disinterested Directors, a fairness opinion is provided by a nationally recognized appraisal or investment banking firm with respect to such Affiliate Transaction. (b) The provisions of the preceding paragraph (a) will not apply to: (i) any Restricted Payment Transaction; (ii) (1) the entering into, maintaining or performance of any employment or consulting contract, collective bargaining agreement, benefit plan, program or arrangement, related trust agreement or any other similar arrangement for or with any current or former employee, officer, director, manager or consultant of or to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary heretofore or hereafter entered into in the ordinary course of business, including vacation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or other similar plans, programs or arrangements, (2) payments, compensation, performance of indemnification or contribution obligations, the making or cancellation of loans in the ordinary course of business to any such employees, officers, directors, managers or consultants, (3) any issuance, grant or award of stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, to any such employees, officers, directors, managers or consultants, (4) the payment of reasonable fees to directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as determined in good faith by the Company or such Subsidiary) or (5) Management Advances and payments in respect thereof (or in reimbursement of any expenses referred to in the definition of such term); (iii) any transaction between or among any of the Company, one or more Restricted Subsidiaries or one or more Special Purpose Entities; (iv) any transaction arising out of agreements or instruments in existence on the Issue Date, as such agreements or instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended or renewed from time to time (provided that any such amendment, modification, supplement, extension or renewal taken as a whole is not materially less favorable to the Holders of the Notes than the terms of such agreement or instrument in existence on the Issue Date (as determined in good faith by the Company)), and any payments made pursuant thereto; (v) any transaction in the ordinary course of business on terms that are fair to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or senior management of the Company, or are not materially less favorable to the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that could be obtained at the time in a transaction with a Person who is not an Affiliate of the Company; (vi) any transaction in the ordinary course of business, or approved by a majority of the Board of Directors, between the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Company controlled by the Company that is a joint venture or similar entity; (vii) the performance of the CD&R Preferred Stock Repurchase Agreement; (viii) the performance of the CD&R Investment Agreement and the CD&R Registration Rights Agreement; and 84 ----- (ix) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company or any capital contribution to the Company. Limitation on Liens. The Indenture will provide that the Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create or permit to exist any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) on any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of any other Person), whether owned on the Issue Date or thereafter acquired, securing any Indebtedness (the “Initial Lien”), other than in the case of any Initial Lien on any asset or property not constituting or required to become Collateral, such Initial Lien if contemporaneously therewith effective provision is made to secure the Indebtedness due under the Indenture and the Notes or, in respect of Liens on any Restricted Subsidiary’s property or assets, any Subsidiary Guarantee of such Restricted Subsidiary, equally and ratably with (or on a senior basis to, in the case of Subordinated Obligations) such obligation for so long as such obligation is so secured by such Initial Lien. Any such Lien thereby created in favor of the Notes or any such Subsidiary Guarantee pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates, (ii) in the case of any such Lien in favor of any such Subsidiary Guarantee, upon the termination and discharge of such Subsidiary Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or (iii) any sale, exchange or transfer (other than a transfer constituting a transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor that is governed by the provisions of the covenant described under “—Merger and Consolidation”) to any Person not an Affiliate of the Company of the property or assets secured by such Initial Lien, or of all of the Capital Stock held by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in, or all or substantially all the assets of, any Restricted Subsidiary creating such Initial Lien, in each case, which release and discharge in the case of any sale of such asset or property shall not affect any Lien that the Collateral Agent, Trustee or any other authorized representative may have on the proceeds from such sale. If the Issuer or any other Grantor creates any Lien upon any property or assets to secure any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, it will contemporaneously therewith grant a pari passu Lien upon such property or assets as security for the Notes or the applicable Subsidiary Guarantee such that the property or assets subject to such Lien becomes Collateral securing the Notes or the applicable Subsidiary Guarantee, as the case may be. Future Subsidiary Guarantors. As set forth more particularly under “—Subsidiary Guarantees,” the Indenture will provide that, from and after the Issue Date, the Company will cause each Restricted Subsidiary (other than a Foreign Subsidiary) that Incurs (including by Guarantee) any Indebtedness under the Senior Term Facility (or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof) or any capital market Indebtedness to execute and deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days thereafter, (i) a supplemental indenture or other instrument pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will guarantee payment of the Notes, whereupon such Restricted Subsidiary will become a Subsidiary Guarantor for all purposes under the Indenture and (ii) a supplement or joinder to, or, as applicable, an amendment, restatement, supplement or other modification of, the Notes Collateral Documents and to take all actions required thereunder to perfect the Liens created thereunder. In addition, the Company may cause any Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor to so guarantee payment of the Notes and become a Subsidiary Guarantor. Subsidiary Guarantees will be subject to release and discharge under certain circumstances prior to payment in full of the Notes. See “—Subsidiary Guarantees.” SEC Reports. The Indenture will provide that so long as any Notes are outstanding: (a) Notwithstanding that the Company may not be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company will file with or furnish to the SEC, and furnish to the Trustee and, upon request, Holders and prospective investors in the Notes, within 15 days after it files them with the SEC, copies of its annual report and the information, documents and other reports that are specified in Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act (as if the Company had been a reporting company under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act). In addition, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee and, upon 85 ----- request, Holders, promptly upon their becoming available, copies of the annual report to shareholders and any other information provided by the Company to its public shareholders generally. In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Company will furnish to Holders and prospective investors in the Notes, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act (as in effect on the Issue Date). (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this covenant, if the Company has filed or furnished the reports and information referred to in such paragraph with the SEC via mail or the EDGAR filing system (or any successor thereto) and such reports and information are publicly available, then the Company will be deemed to have provided and furnished such reports and information to the Trustee and the Holders in satisfaction of the requirement to “furnish” such applicable reports or information as referred to in such paragraph. Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee hereunder is for informational purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of such reports, information and documents does not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company’s compliance with any of its covenants under the Indenture or the Notes (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officer’s Certificates delivered pursuant to the Indenture). The Trustee shall not be obligated to monitor or confirm, on a continuing basis or otherwise, the Company’s compliance with its covenants under the Indenture or with respect to any reports or other documents posted to the Company’s website or filed or furnished by the Company with the SEC or the EDGAR filing system (or any successor thereto). All such reports and information will be prepared in all material respects in accordance with all of the rules and regulations of the SEC applicable to such reports, except that such reports (a) will not be required to include separate financial information that would be required by Rules 3-09, 3-10 and 3-16 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC and (b) will not be subject to the TIA. If any direct or indirect parent company of Beacon that owns, directly or indirectly, 100.0% of the outstanding Capital Stock of Beacon, guarantees the Notes on terms substantially similar to those applicable to Subsidiary Guarantees and files reports with the SEC in accordance with Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, whether voluntarily or otherwise, in compliance with paragraph (a) of this covenant, then Beacon shall be deemed to be in compliance with this covenant; provided that such reports are accompanied by consolidating information that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to such direct or indirect parent company, on the one hand, and the information relating to Beacon and its Subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the other hand. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) such reports need not include separate financial information required by Rules 3-09, 3-10 and 3-16 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC and (ii) the consolidating information referred to in the proviso to the preceding sentence need not be audited or reviewed by auditors. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, failure to comply with this covenant shall be automatically cured when Beacon or its direct or indirect parent company provides all required reports to the Holders or files all required reports with the SEC.",,as_expected,2023,160,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: nan\nText: Limitation on Indebtedness. The Indenture will provide as follows: (a) The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, Incur any Indebtedness; provided, however, that the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur Indebtedness if on the date of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, after giving effect to the Incurrence thereof, the Consolidated Coverage Ratio would be equal to or greater than 2.00:1.00; provided further, however, that the amount of Indebtedness that may be Incurred pursuant to this paragraph (a) by Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Subsidiary Guarantors shall not exceed an amount at any time outstanding equal to the greater of $300 million and 5.0% of Consolidated Total Assets.

(ii) in the case of any Asset Disposition (or series of related Asset Dispositions) having a fair market value of $50 million or more, at least 75.0% of the consideration therefor (excluding, in the case of an Asset Disposition (or series of related Asset Dispositions), any consideration by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, that are not Indebtedness) received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash; and (iii) an amount equal to 100.0% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied by the Company (or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) as follows: (A) first, either (x) to the extent the Company elects (or is required by the terms of any Senior-Priority Obligations (including Credit Facility Indebtedness), any Senior Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor or any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor), to prepay, repay or purchase any such Indebtedness or (in the case of letters of credit, bankers\u2019 acceptances or other similar instruments) cash collateralize any such Indebtedness (in each case other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) within 365 days after the later of the date of such Asset Disposition and the date of receipt of such Net Available Cash, provided that in addition to the foregoing, the Net Available 81 ----- Cash from an Asset Disposition of Collateral may not be applied to prepay or repay or purchase any Indebtedness other than Senior-Priority Obligations, or (y) to the extent the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary with an amount equal to Net Available Cash received by the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary) within 365 days from the later of the date of such Asset Disposition and the date of receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided that the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will be deemed to have complied with the provisions described in subclause (y) of this paragraph if and to the extent that, within 365 days after the later of the Asset Disposition that generated such Net Available Cash and the date of receipt of such Net Available Cash, the Company has entered into a binding agreement to invest in such Additional Assets with the good faith expectation that such Net Available Cash will be applied to satisfy such provisions (an \u201cAcceptable Commitment\u201d), and that investment is thereafter completed within 180 days after the end of such 365-day period, or in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Net Available Cash is applied in connection therewith, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary has entered into another Acceptable Commitment (a \u201cSecond Commitment\u201d) within 180 days of such cancellation or termination and such Net Available Cash is actually applied in such manner within 180 days from the date of the Second Commitment, it being understood that if a Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Available Cash is applied, then such Net Available Cash shall constitute Excess Proceeds (as defined below); (B) second, to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with clause (A) above (such balance, the \u201cExcess Proceeds\u201d), to make an offer to purchase Notes and (to the extent the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, or is required by the terms thereof) to purchase, redeem, prepay or repay any other Senior-Priority Obligations and any other Senior Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (provided that the Excess Proceeds from an Asset Disposition of Collateral may only be applied to purchase, redeem, prepay or repay any Senior Indebtedness other than Senior-Priority Obligations after all such Senior-Priority Obligations have been paid in full), pursuant and subject to the conditions of the Indenture and the agreements governing such other Indebtedness; and (C) third, to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with clauses (A) and (B) above, to fund (to the extent consistent with any other applicable provision of the Indenture) any general corporate purpose (including the repurchase, repayment or other acquisition or retirement of any Subordinated Obligations); provided, however, that in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to clauses (A)(x) or (B) above, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the related loan commitment (if any) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased; provided further, however, that pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with clauses (A) or (B) above, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary may temporarily invest such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture; and (iv) if such Asset Disposition involves the disposition of Collateral, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary has complied with the applicable provisions of the Indenture and the Notes Collateral Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this covenant, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries shall not be required to apply any Net Available Cash or equivalent amount in accordance with this covenant except to the extent that the aggregate Net Available Cash from all Asset Dispositions or equivalent amount that is not applied in accordance with this covenant exceeds $25 million. Subject in all respects to the requirements of clause (iii)(B) of paragraph (a) of this covenant, if the aggregate principal amount of Notes and/or other Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary validly tendered and not withdrawn (or otherwise 82 ----- subject to purchase, redemption or repayment) in connection with an offer pursuant to and in accordance with clause (iii)(B) of paragraph (a) of this covenant exceeds the Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds will be apportioned between such Notes and such other Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, with the portion of the Excess Proceeds payable in respect of such Notes to equal the lesser of (x) the Excess Proceeds amount multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the outstanding principal amount of such Notes and the denominator of which is the sum of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes and the outstanding principal amount of the relevant other Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, and (y) the aggregate principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn. For the purposes of clause (ii) of paragraph (a) of this covenant, the following are deemed to be cash: (1) Temporary Cash Investments and Cash Equivalents; (2) the assumption of Indebtedness of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock of the Company) or any Restricted Subsidiary and the release of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on payment of the principal amount of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; (3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of the principal amount of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; (4) securities received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition; (5) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; (6) Additional Assets; and (7) any Designated Noncash Consideration received by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in an Asset Disposition having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated Noncash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (7), not to exceed an aggregate amount at any time outstanding equal to the greater of $175 million and 2.5% of Consolidated Total Assets (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Noncash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value). (b) In the event of an Asset Disposition that requires the purchase of Notes pursuant to and in accordance with clause (iii)(B) of paragraph (a) of this covenant, the Company will be required to purchase Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to an offer by the Company for the Notes (the \u201cOffer\u201d) at a purchase price of 100.0% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of purchase in accordance with the procedures (including prorating in the event of oversubscription) set forth in the Indenture. If the aggregate purchase price of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer is less than the Net Available Cash allotted to the purchase of Notes, the remaining Net Available Cash will be available to the Company for use in accordance with clause (iii)(B) of paragraph (a) of this covenant (to repay other Senior Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) or clause (iii)(C) of paragraph (a) of this covenant, and the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. The Company will not be required to make an Offer for Notes pursuant to this covenant if the Net Available Cash available therefor (after application of the proceeds as provided in clause (iii)(A) of paragraph (a) of this covenant) is less than $50 million for any particular Asset Disposition (which lesser amounts shall be carried forward for purposes of determining whether an Offer is required with respect to the Net Available Cash from any subsequent Asset Disposition), and the Company will commence such Offer within 20 days after such Net Available Cash equals or exceeds $50 million. No Note will be purchased in part if less than the Minimum Denomination in principal amount of such Note would be left outstanding. (c) The Company will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the purchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this covenant, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this covenant by virtue of its compliance with such securities laws or regulations. Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates. The Indenture will provide as follows: 83 ----- (a) The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Company (an \u201cAffiliate Transaction\u201d) involving aggregate consideration in excess of $15 million unless (i) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction are not materially less favorable to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained at the time in a transaction with a Person who is not an Affiliate of the Company and (ii) if such Affiliate Transaction involves aggregate consideration in excess of $75 million, the terms of such Affiliate Transaction have been approved by a majority of the Board of Directors. Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in this paragraph (a) if (x) such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors or (y) in the event there are no Disinterested Directors, a fairness opinion is provided by a nationally recognized appraisal or investment banking firm with respect to such Affiliate Transaction. (b) The provisions of the preceding paragraph (a) will not apply to: (i) any Restricted Payment Transaction; (ii) (1) the entering into, maintaining or performance of any employment or consulting contract, collective bargaining agreement, benefit plan, program or arrangement, related trust agreement or any other similar arrangement for or with any current or former employee, officer, director, manager or consultant of or to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary heretofore or hereafter entered into in the ordinary course of business, including vacation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or other similar plans, programs or arrangements, (2) payments, compensation, performance of indemnification or contribution obligations, the making or cancellation of loans in the ordinary course of business to any such employees, officers, directors, managers or consultants, (3) any issuance, grant or award of stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, to any such employees, officers, directors, managers or consultants, (4) the payment of reasonable fees to directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as determined in good faith by the Company or such Subsidiary) or (5) Management Advances and payments in respect thereof (or in reimbursement of any expenses referred to in the definition of such term); (iii) any transaction between or among any of the Company, one or more Restricted Subsidiaries or one or more Special Purpose Entities; (iv) any transaction arising out of agreements or instruments in existence on the Issue Date, as such agreements or instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended or renewed from time to time (provided that any such amendment, modification, supplement, extension or renewal taken as a whole is not materially less favorable to the Holders of the Notes than the terms of such agreement or instrument in existence on the Issue Date (as determined in good faith by the Company)), and any payments made pursuant thereto; (v) any transaction in the ordinary course of business on terms that are fair to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or senior management of the Company, or are not materially less favorable to the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that could be obtained at the time in a transaction with a Person who is not an Affiliate of the Company; (vi) any transaction in the ordinary course of business, or approved by a majority of the Board of Directors, between the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Company controlled by the Company that is a joint venture or similar entity; (vii) the performance of the CD&R Preferred Stock Repurchase Agreement; (viii) the performance of the CD&R Investment Agreement and the CD&R Registration Rights Agreement; and 84 ----- (ix) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company or any capital contribution to the Company. Limitation on Liens. The Indenture will provide that the Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create or permit to exist any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) on any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of any other Person), whether owned on the Issue Date or thereafter acquired, securing any Indebtedness (the \u201cInitial Lien\u201d), other than in the case of any Initial Lien on any asset or property not constituting or required to become Collateral, such Initial Lien if contemporaneously therewith effective provision is made to secure the Indebtedness due under the Indenture and the Notes or, in respect of Liens on any Restricted Subsidiary\u2019s property or assets, any Subsidiary Guarantee of such Restricted Subsidiary, equally and ratably with (or on a senior basis to, in the case of Subordinated Obligations) such obligation for so long as such obligation is so secured by such Initial Lien. Any such Lien thereby created in favor of the Notes or any such Subsidiary Guarantee pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates, (ii) in the case of any such Lien in favor of any such Subsidiary Guarantee, upon the termination and discharge of such Subsidiary Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or (iii) any sale, exchange or transfer (other than a transfer constituting a transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor that is governed by the provisions of the covenant described under \u201c\u2014Merger and Consolidation\u201d) to any Person not an Affiliate of the Company of the property or assets secured by such Initial Lien, or of all of the Capital Stock held by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in, or all or substantially all the assets of, any Restricted Subsidiary creating such Initial Lien, in each case, which release and discharge in the case of any sale of such asset or property shall not affect any Lien that the Collateral Agent, Trustee or any other authorized representative may have on the proceeds from such sale. If the Issuer or any other Grantor creates any Lien upon any property or assets to secure any Non-ABL Loan/Notes Obligations, it will contemporaneously therewith grant a pari passu Lien upon such property or assets as security for the Notes or the applicable Subsidiary Guarantee such that the property or assets subject to such Lien becomes Collateral securing the Notes or the applicable Subsidiary Guarantee, as the case may be. Future Subsidiary Guarantors. As set forth more particularly under \u201c\u2014Subsidiary Guarantees,\u201d the Indenture will provide that, from and after the Issue Date, the Company will cause each Restricted Subsidiary (other than a Foreign Subsidiary) that Incurs (including by Guarantee) any Indebtedness under the Senior Term Facility (or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof) or any capital market Indebtedness to execute and deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days thereafter, (i) a supplemental indenture or other instrument pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will guarantee payment of the Notes, whereupon such Restricted Subsidiary will become a Subsidiary Guarantor for all purposes under the Indenture and (ii) a supplement or joinder to, or, as applicable, an amendment, restatement, supplement or other modification of, the Notes Collateral Documents and to take all actions required thereunder to perfect the Liens created thereunder. In addition, the Company may cause any Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor to so guarantee payment of the Notes and become a Subsidiary Guarantor. Subsidiary Guarantees will be subject to release and discharge under certain circumstances prior to payment in full of the Notes. See \u201c\u2014Subsidiary Guarantees.\u201d SEC Reports. The Indenture will provide that so long as any Notes are outstanding: (a) Notwithstanding that the Company may not be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company will file with or furnish to the SEC, and furnish to the Trustee and, upon request, Holders and prospective investors in the Notes, within 15 days after it files them with the SEC, copies of its annual report and the information, documents and other reports that are specified in Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act (as if the Company had been a reporting company under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act). In addition, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee and, upon 85 ----- request, Holders, promptly upon their becoming available, copies of the annual report to shareholders and any other information provided by the Company to its public shareholders generally. In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Company will furnish to Holders and prospective investors in the Notes, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act (as in effect on the Issue Date). (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this covenant, if the Company has filed or furnished the reports and information referred to in such paragraph with the SEC via mail or the EDGAR filing system (or any successor thereto) and such reports and information are publicly available, then the Company will be deemed to have provided and furnished such reports and information to the Trustee and the Holders in satisfaction of the requirement to \u201cfurnish\u201d such applicable reports or information as referred to in such paragraph. Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee hereunder is for informational purposes only and the Trustee\u2019s receipt of such reports, information and documents does not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company\u2019s compliance with any of its covenants under the Indenture or the Notes (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officer\u2019s Certificates delivered pursuant to the Indenture). The Trustee shall not be obligated to monitor or confirm, on a continuing basis or otherwise, the Company\u2019s compliance with its covenants under the Indenture or with respect to any reports or other documents posted to the Company\u2019s website or filed or furnished by the Company with the SEC or the EDGAR filing system (or any successor thereto). All such reports and information will be prepared in all material respects in accordance with all of the rules and regulations of the SEC applicable to such reports, except that such reports (a) will not be required to include separate financial information that would be required by Rules 3-09, 3-10 and 3-16 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC and (b) will not be subject to the TIA. If any direct or indirect parent company of Beacon that owns, directly or indirectly, 100.0% of the outstanding Capital Stock of Beacon, guarantees the Notes on terms substantially similar to those applicable to Subsidiary Guarantees and files reports with the SEC in accordance with Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, whether voluntarily or otherwise, in compliance with paragraph (a) of this covenant, then Beacon shall be deemed to be in compliance with this covenant; provided that such reports are accompanied by consolidating information that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to such direct or indirect parent company, on the one hand, and the information relating to Beacon and its Subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the other hand. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) such reports need not include separate financial information required by Rules 3-09, 3-10 and 3-16 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC and (ii) the consolidating information referred to in the proviso to the preceding sentence need not be audited or reviewed by auditors. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, failure to comply with this covenant shall be automatically cured when Beacon or its direct or indirect parent company provides all required reports to the Holders or files all required reports with the SEC.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}",,,

Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless (i) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice stating that an Event of Default is continuing, (ii) Holders of at least 30.0% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have made a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy, (iii) such Holders have offered the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense, (iv) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity and (v) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or, subject to the second paragraph under \u201c\u2014Concerning the Trustee\u201d, that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability; provided, however, that the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification or security by the Holders satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and is known to the Trustee, subject to the following sentence, the Trustee will mail or otherwise deliver to each Holder in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC notice of the Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as its Trust Officer in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interest of the Noteholders. In addition, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer\u2019s Certificate indicating whether, to the best knowledge of the signer, the Company is in Default. The Issuer will also deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any event that would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. 91 -----\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}",,,

We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Company, the Trustee or the initial purchasers of the Notes are responsible for those operations or procedures. DTC has advised us that it is: - a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York; - a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York State Banking Law; - a member of the Federal Reserve System; - a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code; and - a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between its participants through electronic book-entry changes to the accounts of its participants. DTC’s participants include securities brokers and dealers, including the initial purchasers of the Notes, banks and trust companies, clearing corporations and other organizations. Indirect access to DTC’s system is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies; these indirect participants clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC participant, either directly or indirectly. Investors who are not DTC participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through DTC participants or indirect participants in DTC. 130 ----- So long as DTC’s nominee is the registered owner of a global note, that nominee will be considered the sole owner or holder of the Notes represented by that global note for all purposes under the Indenture. Except as provided below, owners of beneficial interests in a global note: - will not be entitled to have Notes represented by the global note registered in their names; - will not receive or be entitled to receive physical, certificated notes; and - will not be considered the owners or holders of the Notes under the Indenture for any purpose, including with respect to the giving of any direction, instruction or approval to the Trustee. As a result, each investor who owns a beneficial interest in a global note must rely on the procedures of DTC to exercise any rights of a holder of Notes under the Indenture (and, if the investor is not a participant or an indirect participant in DTC, on the procedures of the DTC participant through which the investor owns its interest). Payments of principal, premium (if any) and interest with respect to the Notes represented by a global note will be made by the paying agent to DTC’s nominee as the registered holder of the global note. Neither we nor the Trustee will have any responsibility or liability for the payment of amounts to owners of beneficial interests in a global note, for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of those interests by DTC, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records of DTC relating to those interests. Payments by participants and indirect participants in DTC to the owners of beneficial interests in a global note will be governed by standing instructions and customary industry practice and will be the responsibility of those participants or indirect participants and DTC. Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected under DTC’s procedures and will be settled in same-day funds. Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way under the rules and operating procedures of those systems. Cross market transfers between DTC participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected within DTC through the DTC participants that are acting as depositaries for Euroclear and Clearstream. To deliver or receive an interest in a global note held in a Euroclear or Clearstream account, an investor must send transfer instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, under the rules and procedures of that system and within the established deadlines of that system. If the transaction meets its settlement requirements, Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will send instructions to its DTC depositary to take action to effect final settlement by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant global notes in DTC, and making or receiving payment under normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the DTC depositaries that are acting for Euroclear or Clearstream.

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the above procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the global notes among participants in those settlement systems. However, the settlement systems are not obligated to perform these procedures and may discontinue or change these procedures at any time.

In addition, this summary does not describe any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. jurisdiction and does not consider any aspects of U.S. federal tax law other than income taxation (such as estate and gift taxation). This summary is based on the provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial authority, published administrative positions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this offering memorandum. Changes in such authorities or new interpretations thereof may have retroactive effect and could significantly affect the U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed below.

The initial purchasers initially propose to offer the notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the cover page of this offering memorandum. After the initial offering, the initial purchasers may change the offering price and any other selling terms. The initial purchasers may offer and sell the notes through certain of their affiliates. In the purchase agreement, we have agreed that: - we and the guarantors will not offer or sell any of our debt securities (other than the notes) for a period of 90 days after the date of this offering memorandum without the prior consent of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC; and - we and the guarantor will indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or contribute to payments that the initial purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities. The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction. Each initial purchaser has agreed that: - the notes may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act or in transactions not subject to those registration requirements; and - during the initial distribution of the notes, it will offer or sell notes only to persons reasonably believed to be QIBs in compliance with Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S. In addition, until 40 days following the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the Securities Act. 143 ----- The notes are a new issue of securities, and there is currently no established trading market for the notes. In addition, the notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Notice to Investors.” We do not intend to apply for the notes to be listed on any securities exchange or to arrange for the notes to be quoted on any quotation system. The initial purchasers have advised us that they currently intend to make a market in the notes. However, they are not obligated to do so and may discontinue any market-making activities at any time without any notice. The ability of the initial purchasers to make a market in the notes may be impacted by changes in any regulatory requirements (including as a result of regulatory developments such as the SEC’s interpretation of Rule 15c2-11 and its application to debt securities) applicable to the marketing, holding and trading of, and issuing quotations with respect to, the notes. The initial purchasers may discontinue any market making in the notes at any time in their sole discretion and without notice. In addition, such marketmaking activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid trading market will develop for the notes, that you will be able to sell your notes at a particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be favorable. If the notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the markets for similar securities, our operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors. You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp taxes and other charges in connection with purchases of securities. In connection with the offering of the notes, the initial purchasers may engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the initial purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Overallotments, stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may cause the price of the notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If the initial purchasers engage in overallotment, stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions, they may discontinue them at any time without notice. Neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transaction described above may have on the price of the notes. The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, market making, financing and brokerage activities. The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates perform various financial advisory, investment banking and commercial banking services from time to time for us and our affiliates for which we or our affiliates pay customary compensation. Certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates are lenders and/or agents under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. In particular, an affiliate of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is a lender under the 2028 Term Loan and 2026 ABL and an affiliate of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. is a lender and the administrative agent and collateral agent under the 2028 Term Loan and a lender under the 2026 ABL. Certain of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates that we have a lending relationship with routinely hedge, and certain other of those initial purchasers or their respective affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes offered hereby. In addition, from time to time, the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may effect transactions for their own accounts or the accounts of customers, and hold on behalf of themselves or their customers, long or short positions in our debt or equity securities or loans, and may do so in the future. In the ordinary course of their 144 ----- various business activities, the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and securities activities may involve our securities and/or instruments or those of our subsidiaries. The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. It is expected that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about, 2023, which is the business day following the date hereof (such settlement cycle being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will settle in T+, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding business days should consult their own advisors.",,as_expected,2023,160,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: nan\nText: J.P.

Morgan Securities LLC is a lender under the 2028 Term Loan and 2026 ABL and an affiliate of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. is a lender and the administrative agent and collateral agent under the 2028 Term Loan and a lender under the 2026 ABL. Certain of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates that we have a lending relationship with routinely hedge, and certain other of those initial purchasers or their respective affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes offered hereby. In addition, from time to time, the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may effect transactions for their own accounts or the accounts of customers, and hold on behalf of themselves or their customers, long or short positions in our debt or equity securities or loans, and may do so in the future. In the ordinary course of their 144 ----- various business activities, the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and securities activities may involve our securities and/or instruments or those of our subsidiaries. The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. It is expected that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about, 2023, which is the business day following the date hereof (such settlement cycle being referred to as \u201cT+ \u201d). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will settle in T+, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding business days should consult their own advisors.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}",,,
