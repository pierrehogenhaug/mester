Heathrow generates two primary types of income: - aeronautical income (£1,523 million or 62 per cent. of total income in 2013), which is generated from fees charged to airlines for use of its facilities for flight and passenger activities and is subject to the CAA’s price caps; and - non-aeronautical income (£951 million or 38 per cent. of total income in 2013), which is taken into account by the CAA in setting maximum aeronautical yields and is generated mainly from retail concession fees, car parking income, Heathrow Express rail operations and other services supplied by Heathrow. Heathrow is subject to economic regulation by the Civil Aviation Authority (the “CAA”). The CAA sets caps on the amount that Heathrow can charge airlines for using its facilities. The price caps are set for a five-year period or Quinquennium, which can be extended by one year. This price setting mechanism provides significant cash flow predictability within each Quinquennium and provides substantial explicit protection against costs resulting from new security regulations. The price caps take into account Heathrow’s forecast revenues (both aeronautical and non-aeronautical) and costs as well as allowing recovery of capital costs and a return on capital. The return on capital is based on its opening RAB and its forecast capital expenditure for the Quinquennium. As for other regulated utilities in the UK, the RAB acts as a unit of regulatory value and does not correspond to statutory asset values. The RAB is adjusted each year principally for capital expenditure, RPI inflation, regulatory depreciation and proceeds of disposals. The regulated price-setting mechanism provides significant income predictability and cash flow visibility within each regulatory period as well as protection against longer-term cost and revenue risks.

139,Preliminary Offerings 2014.md,945,FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE,945.10,Ring-fencing of the Group,945.10.1,Change in Group RAR covenant and restriction on distributions and use of proceeds of the Notes,"Since 2010, the Group has targeted maintaining gross debt at the Issuer of around 5 per cent. of the Group’s RAB over the medium term. As at 30 June 2014, the Issuer’s gross debt was £763 million, equivalent to approximately 5.1 per cent. of Heathrow’s RAB at that date. The Group intends to move over the medium term to having a restriction on distributions and breach of covenant if pro forma Group RAR is greater than 92.5 per cent., meaning that gross debt at the Issuer could increase in due course to around 7.5 per cent. of the Group’s RAB.

139,Preliminary Offerings 2014.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.24,UK insolvency law may impact the rights of creditors including the Noteholders in certain circumstances.,13.24.1,,"The English insolvency statutes empower English courts to make an administration order in respect of an English company. An administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that the relevant company is or is likely to become ----- unable to pay its debts and that the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. In addition, the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” over the assets of an English company may appoint an administrator out of court, provided such floating charge has become enforceable. In this case the prospective administrator must be satisfied that the purpose of administration is reasonably likely to be achieved. An English company or the directors of such company may also appoint an administrator out of court. The purpose of an administration comprises three parts which must be looked at successively: rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company's creditors as a whole or, if neither of those objectives are reasonably practicable, and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realising property to make a distribution to secured or preferred creditors. The rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are particularly curtailed in an administration. Upon the appointment of an administrator, no step may be taken to enforce security over the company's property, except with the consent of the administrator or leave of the court. The same requirements for consent or leave apply to the commencement or institution of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress or diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for leave, in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above. Accordingly, if the Issuer was to enter into administration proceedings, the Notes and the related security from the Issuer could not be enforced while the relevant company was in administration, without the leave of the court or consent of the administrator. There can be no assurance that the security agent would obtain this leave of the court or consent of the administrator. In addition, an administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act 1986, dispose of the property of a company in administration. However, the general prohibition against enforcement by secured creditors without consent of the administrator or leave of the Court, and the administrators' powers with respect to floating and other security, do not apply to any security interest created or arising under a financial collateral arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Agreements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (UK). A financial collateral arrangement includes (subject to certain other conditions) a pledge over shares in a company, where both the collateral provider and collateral taker are non-natural persons. Under English insolvency law, the liquidator or administrator of a company may, among other things, apply to the court to unwind a transaction entered into by such company, if such company was unable to pay its debts (as defined in section 123 of the Insolvency Act 1986) at the time of, or as a result of, the transaction and enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within two years of the completion of the transaction. A transaction might be subject to a challenge if it was entered into by a company “at an undervalue”, that is, it involved a gift by the company or the company received consideration of less value than the benefit given by such company. However, a court generally will not intervene if a company entered into the transaction in good faith for the purpose of carrying on its business and at the time it did so there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit such company. The Issuer believes that the Notes will not be issued on terms which would amount to a transaction at an undervalue, that the offering is in good faith for the purposes of carrying on the Group's business and that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction will benefit the Group. However, there can be no assurance that the issuance of the Notes will not be challenged by a liquidator or administrator or that a court would support this analysis. In addition, if it can be shown that a transaction entered into by an English company was made for less than fair value and was made to shield assets from creditors, then the transaction may be set aside as a transaction defrauding creditors. Any person who is a “victim” of the transaction, and not just liquidators or administrators, may assert such a claim. There is no statutory time limit within which a claim must be made and the company need not be insolvent at the time of the transaction. If the Issuer was to commence administration proceedings, the Notes and the related security could not be enforced while the relevant company was in administration. The holder of a qualifying floating charge that has been created since 15 September 2003 over all or substantially all of the assets of an English company can generally no longer appoint an administrative receiver of that company. There is, however, an exception to this rule that applies to certain capital markets transactions that are expected to incur at least £50 million of debt. Any interest accruing under or in respect of the Notes for any period from the date of commencement of administration or liquidation proceedings, to the extent not fully covered by the assets securing the Notes, could be recovered by holders of the Notes only from any surplus remaining after payment of all other debts provided in the proceeding and interest accrued but unpaid up to the date of the commencement of the proceeding. Under English insolvency law, certain preferential claims, including unpaid contributions to occupational pension schemes in respect of the twelve-month period prior to insolvency and unpaid employees' remuneration in respect of the four-month ----- period prior to insolvency, will, while ranking behind the claims of holders of fixed security, rank ahead of floating charges. In addition, a prescribed part of floating charge realisations (being 50 per cent. of the first £10,000 of net realisations and 20 per cent. of the net realisations thereafter, up to a maximum of £600,000) is required to be set aside for the benefit of unsecured creditors and, as such, ranks ahead of the relevant floating charge.",,as_expected,2014,102,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: nan\nText: The English insolvency statutes empower English courts to make an administration order in respect of an English company.

Accordingly, if the Issuer was to enter into administration proceedings, the Notes and the related security from the Issuer could not be enforced while the relevant company was in administration, without the leave of the court or consent of the administrator. There can be no assurance that the security agent would obtain this leave of the court or consent of the administrator. In addition, an administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act 1986, dispose of the property of a company in administration. However, the general prohibition against enforcement by secured creditors without consent of the administrator or leave of the Court, and the administrators' powers with respect to floating and other security, do not apply to any security interest created or arising under a financial collateral arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Agreements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (UK). A financial collateral arrangement includes (subject to certain other conditions) a pledge over shares in a company, where both the collateral provider and collateral taker are non-natural persons. Under English insolvency law, the liquidator or administrator of a company may, among other things, apply to the court to unwind a transaction entered into by such company, if such company was unable to pay its debts (as defined in section 123 of the Insolvency Act 1986) at the time of, or as a result of, the transaction and enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within two years of the completion of the transaction. A transaction might be subject to a challenge if it was entered into by a company \u201cat an undervalue\u201d, that is, it involved a gift by the company or the company received consideration of less value than the benefit given by such company. However, a court generally will not intervene if a company entered into the transaction in good faith for the purpose of carrying on its business and at the time it did so there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit such company. The Issuer believes that the Notes will not be issued on terms which would amount to a transaction at an undervalue, that the offering is in good faith for the purposes of carrying on the Group's business and that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction will benefit the Group. However, there can be no assurance that the issuance of the Notes will not be challenged by a liquidator or administrator or that a court would support this analysis. In addition, if it can be shown that a transaction entered into by an English company was made for less than fair value and was made to shield assets from creditors, then the transaction may be set aside as a transaction defrauding creditors. Any person who is a \u201cvictim\u201d of the transaction, and not just liquidators or administrators, may assert such a claim. There is no statutory time limit within which a claim must be made and the company need not be insolvent at the time of the transaction. If the Issuer was to commence administration proceedings, the Notes and the related security could not be enforced while the relevant company was in administration. The holder of a qualifying floating charge that has been created since 15 September 2003 over all or substantially all of the assets of an English company can generally no longer appoint an administrative receiver of that company. There is, however, an exception to this rule that applies to certain capital markets transactions that are expected to incur at least \u00a350 million of debt. Any interest accruing under or in respect of the Notes for any period from the date of commencement of administration or liquidation proceedings, to the extent not fully covered by the assets securing the Notes, could be recovered by holders of the Notes only from any surplus remaining after payment of all other debts provided in the proceeding and interest accrued but unpaid up to the date of the commencement of the proceeding. Under English insolvency law, certain preferential claims, including unpaid contributions to occupational pension schemes in respect of the twelve-month period prior to insolvency and unpaid employees' remuneration in respect of the four-month ----- period prior to insolvency, will, while ranking behind the claims of holders of fixed security, rank ahead of floating charges. In addition, a prescribed part of floating charge realisations (being 50 per cent. of the first \u00a310,000 of net realisations and 20 per cent. of the net realisations thereafter, up to a maximum of \u00a3600,000) is required to be set aside for the benefit of unsecured creditors and, as such, ranks ahead of the relevant floating charge.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

Similar income for this purpose includes payments on redemption of Notes representing any discount on the issue of Notes or any premium payable on redemption. However, for a transitional period, Austria and Luxembourg may instead impose a withholding system in relation to such payments, deducting tax at a rate of 35 per cent. Luxembourg has announced that it will no longer apply the withholding tax system as from 1 January 2015 and will then commence automatic information exchange under the EC Directive. The transitional period is to terminate at the end of the first full fiscal year following agreement by certain non-EU countries to the exchange of information relating to such payments. A number of other countries and territories have adopted similar measures to the EC Directive. On 24 March 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted a Council Directive amending and broadening the scope of the requirements described above. Member States are required to apply these new requirements from 1 January 2017. The changes will expand the range of payments covered by the EC Directive, in particular to include additional types of income payable on securities. The EC Directive will also apply a “look through approach” to payments made via certain persons, entities or legal arrangements (including trusts and partnerships), where certain conditions are satisfied, where an individual resident in a Member State is regarded as the beneficial owner of the payment for the purposes of the EC Directive. This approach may in some cases apply where the person, entity or arrangement is established or effectively managed outside of the European Union. If a payment were to be made or collected through a Member State which has opted for a withholding system and an amount of, or in respect of tax were to be withheld from that payment, no additional amounts would be required to be paid to Noteholders as a result of the imposition of such withholding tax (see Condition 10 (Taxation) of the Terms and Conditions of the Notes).

139,Preliminary Offerings 2014.md,956,"HEATHROW AIRPORT’S INFRASTRUCTURE, FACILITIES AND ACCESS",956.1,,956.1.1,,"_Overview_ Heathrow airport commenced operations as London’s principal commercial airport in 1946. The airport’s first permanent terminal opened in 1955 and the substantial growth in demand for air transport throughout the 1960s and 1970s saw much of the core infrastructure at Heathrow airport’s Central Terminal Area developed, including the opening of what is now Terminal 3 in 1961 and Terminal 1 in 1968 and the construction of car parks, public transport and other operational and administration facilities. Terminal 4 was added in 1986. In 2008, Terminal 5 opened on the western side of the airport. The terminal provides passenger capacity for up to 30 million passengers per year. The terminal has transformed passenger experience and also operational performance. The main building and its satellites are positioned perpendicular to the runways, to maximise the efficient use of land on the airport, delivering operationally efficient taxiway and runway hold processes for the benefit of the whole campus. As well as delivering passenger, airline and airport benefit in its own right, the additional terminal capacity created by Terminal 5 provided the space to allow Heathrow to begin renovating and rebuilding its other terminals. The first key phase in transforming Heathrow’s existing terminals was the construction of a new Terminal 2. The original Terminal 2 was closed in late 2009 with demolition of the old terminal infrastructure enabling construction of the new terminal to commence in mid-2010. In June 2014, the £2.5 billion investment was opened on time and on budget and attained a high safety record during the construction phase. The original Terminal 2, opened by Her Majesty the Queen in 1955, was Heathrow's first terminal and was designed to deal with 1.2 million passengers a year. The new terminal has the capacity to cater for up to 20 million passengers a year. Airlines and passengers benefit from a £2.5 billion investment in state of the art facilities that include main terminal and satellite buildings, a multi-storey short-stay car park and an energy centre supporting the Terminal 2 campus and the wider airport. The terminal and satellite buildings include 24 aircraft stands of which 7 stands are capable of handling the increasing number of A380 aircraft operating at Heathrow. The terminal will be home to all 23 Star Alliance member airlines operating at Heathrow together with Aer Lingus, Virgin Atlantic Little Red and germanwings. For the Star Alliance airlines it provides the opportunity to enhance efficiencies through use of common facilities, processes and personnel. It also enhances the scope for closer commercial co-operation between alliance members by, for example, capitalising on competitive minimum connection times to attract greater volumes of transfer passengers. Both these features will further strengthen Heathrow’s competitive position. Heathrow’s terminal capacity is expected to increase to approximately 85 million passengers per year once Terminal 2 is fully operational and Terminal 1 operations are discontinued (the latter of which is expected by the end of 2015). In parallel with the work on Heathrow’s terminals, significant investment continues in Heathrow’s baggage infrastructure. The underground automated baggage system between Terminal 3 and Terminal 5 is now fully operational, and delivery of the Terminal 3 integrated baggage system remains on track to start operation in 2015. ----- _Runways_ Heathrow airport’s two parallel runways generally operate in “segregated mode”, with arriving aircraft allocated to one runway and departing aircraft to the other. To mitigate noise impact to residents living below the approach and departure routes, the allocation of runways to arriving and departing aircraft is normally swapped at around 3:00 p.m. each day or as weather conditions necessitate. The airport is permitted to schedule up to 480,000 air transport movements per year and in 2013 its runways operated nearly 98 per cent. of their permitted capacity. _Retail Facilities_ Heathrow has a total of approximately 53,000 square metres of retail space served by over 120 retail clients operating almost 500 retail outlets. Terminal 5, with over 24,000 square metres of retail space, has significantly increased the airport’s overall retail portfolio. Heathrow owns over 20,000 public car park spaces that are available to travellers and the general public. All terminals at Heathrow airport are served by car rental operators. The terminals and their approaches provide advertising space, which yields further income. _Access to Heathrow airport_ Heathrow’s extensive ground transport links facilitate access to the airport for passengers, cargo transporters and airport personnel: - Heathrow is located just off the M4 motorway to London and the west of England and London’s orbital motorway, the M25. - Heathrow Express offers a frequent non-stop rail service to and from London Paddington Station. This service is supplemented by the Heathrow Connect “stopping service”, which provides local access to the airport as well as connections with train services on the main rail line between London and the west of England. - Additional direct rail connections to Heathrow airport are expected in the future following the completion of the cross London rail service Crossrail. In addition, the UK Government has confirmed its support for a rail link between Heathrow airport and the west of England on the Great Western Main Line forecast for completion in 2021 and the proposed high speed rail link between London and Birmingham (with a connection to Heathrow airport) that is currently scheduled to be operational by 2026. - The London Underground Piccadilly Line has stations serving each of the terminals at Heathrow airport. - Long distance coach services operated by National Express provide fast services from Heathrow airport to various parts of the United Kingdom, including Victoria Coach Station in Central London. Many of the local bus services in the nearby London suburbs also run to the airport. _Future investment at Heathrow Airport_ The opening of Terminal 2 is the culmination of an £11 billion capital investment at Heathrow over the last decade that has transformed Heathrow’s infrastructure and positioned it strongly to continue its role as a leading global hub airport for the benefit of the whole of the UK in the coming decades. It is expected that by the end of 2014 around 70 per cent. of passengers will be using new or recently constructed terminals and the remaining 30 per cent. of passengers will be using extensively refurbished terminals. The investment programme is also facilitating the co-location of members of each of the three main global airline alliances. Investment in Heathrow’s baggage infrastructure, the largest integrated baggage system in the world, continues in 2014. The underground automated baggage system between Terminal 3 and Terminal 5 is fully operational, with the ability to move 3,000 bags per hour via individual bag carriers travelling up to 20 miles per hour. The Terminal 3 integrated baggage system, housed in a separate building, remains on track to start operations in 2015. The baggage building is now complete, systems are being tested and commissioned and operational trials have started. Capital expenditure for the Q6 regulatory period from 1 April 2014 to 31 December 2018 is forecast to be at least £2.3 billion. The capital programme is materially lower than in the last two regulatory periods, and is primarily focused on maintenance and compliance related projects, operational resilience and improving the passenger experience. The plan includes refurbishment of tunnels to the Central Terminal Area, a £1 billion programme of asset management and replacement projects and a £350 million project to implement latest generation hold baggage screening equipment. ----- In line with the regulatory settlement, the capital programme for Q6 may increase to up to £3.3 billion, this is subject to further scoping of the remaining individual projects through the regulatory period and corresponding approval of the business cases.",,as_expected,2014,102,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: nan\nText: _Overview_ Heathrow airport commenced operations as London\u2019s principal commercial airport in 1946.

The airport\u2019s first permanent terminal opened in 1955 and the substantial growth in demand for air transport throughout the 1960s and 1970s saw much of the core infrastructure at Heathrow airport\u2019s Central Terminal Area developed, including the opening of what is now Terminal 3 in 1961 and Terminal 1 in 1968 and the construction of car parks, public transport and other operational and administration facilities. Terminal 4 was added in 1986. In 2008, Terminal 5 opened on the western side of the airport. The terminal provides passenger capacity for up to 30 million passengers per year. The terminal has transformed passenger experience and also operational performance. The main building and its satellites are positioned perpendicular to the runways, to maximise the efficient use of land on the airport, delivering operationally efficient taxiway and runway hold processes for the benefit of the whole campus. As well as delivering passenger, airline and airport benefit in its own right, the additional terminal capacity created by Terminal 5 provided the space to allow Heathrow to begin renovating and rebuilding its other terminals. The first key phase in transforming Heathrow\u2019s existing terminals was the construction of a new Terminal 2. The original Terminal 2 was closed in late 2009 with demolition of the old terminal infrastructure enabling construction of the new terminal to commence in mid-2010. In June 2014, the \u00a32.5 billion investment was opened on time and on budget and attained a high safety record during the construction phase. The original Terminal 2, opened by Her Majesty the Queen in 1955, was Heathrow's first terminal and was designed to deal with 1.2 million passengers a year. The new terminal has the capacity to cater for up to 20 million passengers a year. Airlines and passengers benefit from a \u00a32.5 billion investment in state of the art facilities that include main terminal and satellite buildings, a multi-storey short-stay car park and an energy centre supporting the Terminal 2 campus and the wider airport. The terminal and satellite buildings include 24 aircraft stands of which 7 stands are capable of handling the increasing number of A380 aircraft operating at Heathrow. The terminal will be home to all 23 Star Alliance member airlines operating at Heathrow together with Aer Lingus, Virgin Atlantic Little Red and germanwings. For the Star Alliance airlines it provides the opportunity to enhance efficiencies through use of common facilities, processes and personnel. It also enhances the scope for closer commercial co-operation between alliance members by, for example, capitalising on competitive minimum connection times to attract greater volumes of transfer passengers. Both these features will further strengthen Heathrow\u2019s competitive position. Heathrow\u2019s terminal capacity is expected to increase to approximately 85 million passengers per year once Terminal 2 is fully operational and Terminal 1 operations are discontinued (the latter of which is expected by the end of 2015). In parallel with the work on Heathrow\u2019s terminals, significant investment continues in Heathrow\u2019s baggage infrastructure. The underground automated baggage system between Terminal 3 and Terminal 5 is now fully operational, and delivery of the Terminal 3 integrated baggage system remains on track to start operation in 2015. ----- _Runways_ Heathrow airport\u2019s two parallel runways generally operate in \u201csegregated mode\u201d, with arriving aircraft allocated to one runway and departing aircraft to the other. To mitigate noise impact to residents living below the approach and departure routes, the allocation of runways to arriving and departing aircraft is normally swapped at around 3:00 p.m. each day or as weather conditions necessitate. The airport is permitted to schedule up to 480,000 air transport movements per year and in 2013 its runways operated nearly 98 per cent. of their permitted capacity. _Retail Facilities_ Heathrow has a total of approximately 53,000 square metres of retail space served by over 120 retail clients operating almost 500 retail outlets. Terminal 5, with over 24,000 square metres of retail space, has significantly increased the airport\u2019s overall retail portfolio. Heathrow owns over 20,000 public car park spaces that are available to travellers and the general public. All terminals at Heathrow airport are served by car rental operators. The terminals and their approaches provide advertising space, which yields further income. _Access to Heathrow airport_ Heathrow\u2019s extensive ground transport links facilitate access to the airport for passengers, cargo transporters and airport personnel: - Heathrow is located just off the M4 motorway to London and the west of England and London\u2019s orbital motorway, the M25. - Heathrow Express offers a frequent non-stop rail service to and from London Paddington Station. This service is supplemented by the Heathrow Connect \u201cstopping service\u201d, which provides local access to the airport as well as connections with train services on the main rail line between London and the west of England. - Additional direct rail connections to Heathrow airport are expected in the future following the completion of the cross London rail service Crossrail. In addition, the UK Government has confirmed its support for a rail link between Heathrow airport and the west of England on the Great Western Main Line forecast for completion in 2021 and the proposed high speed rail link between London and Birmingham (with a connection to Heathrow airport) that is currently scheduled to be operational by 2026. - The London Underground Piccadilly Line has stations serving each of the terminals at Heathrow airport. - Long distance coach services operated by National Express provide fast services from Heathrow airport to various parts of the United Kingdom, including Victoria Coach Station in Central London. Many of the local bus services in the nearby London suburbs also run to the airport. _Future investment at Heathrow Airport_ The opening of Terminal 2 is the culmination of an \u00a311 billion capital investment at Heathrow over the last decade that has transformed Heathrow\u2019s infrastructure and positioned it strongly to continue its role as a leading global hub airport for the benefit of the whole of the UK in the coming decades. It is expected that by the end of 2014 around 70 per cent. of passengers will be using new or recently constructed terminals and the remaining 30 per cent. of passengers will be using extensively refurbished terminals. The investment programme is also facilitating the co-location of members of each of the three main global airline alliances. Investment in Heathrow\u2019s baggage infrastructure, the largest integrated baggage system in the world, continues in 2014. The underground automated baggage system between Terminal 3 and Terminal 5 is fully operational, with the ability to move 3,000 bags per hour via individual bag carriers travelling up to 20 miles per hour. The Terminal 3 integrated baggage system, housed in a separate building, remains on track to start operations in 2015. The baggage building is now complete, systems are being tested and commissioned and operational trials have started. Capital expenditure for the Q6 regulatory period from 1 April 2014 to 31 December 2018 is forecast to be at least \u00a32.3 billion. The capital programme is materially lower than in the last two regulatory periods, and is primarily focused on maintenance and compliance related projects, operational resilience and improving the passenger experience.

139,Preliminary Offerings 2014.md,957,TRAFFIC,957.2,"Compound Annual Growth Rate, 2003-2013........** **1.4** **0.3",957.2.1,,"Source: Heathrow. (1) Percentage growth on previous year is based on unrounded passenger and air transport movement numbers. Over the period from 2003 to 2013, traffic at Heathrow airport increased 14% to 72.3 million passengers in 2013, an annual compound rate of 1.4 per cent. Growth at the start of the period partially reflected recovery in passenger traffic following the terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001. The increase in passenger traffic in 2004 also reflected a return to growth in Far East traffic following the SARS outbreak in 2003. Between 2004 and 2007 traffic increased marginally. In 2008 and 2009, there were modest declines in traffic as a result of the global financial crisis. In 2010, reported traffic declined a further 0.2 per cent. due to disruption from a number of exceptional events including closure of UK and European airspace in April due to ash from an Icelandic volcano. The impact of these events was estimated at a loss of up to 2.4 million passengers, representing underlying traffic growth of 3.4 per cent. From 2010 onwards, Heathrow has attained record annual traffic. From 2004 onwards, but excluding reductions in 2009 and 2010, the airport has been operating close to its limit of 480,000 air transport movements per year. In 2013, Heathrow operated at close to 98 per cent. of this limit. As a result, overall passenger growth at the airport has been driven by factors such as increased passenger numbers per aircraft, including through higher load factors and the introduction of larger aircraft. In addition one off factors such as the acquisition of bmi by International Airlines Group (parent company of British Airways) has driven traffic growth. bmi previously accounted for 8.0 per cent. of Heathrow’s total air transport movements but only 4.4 per cent. of passengers. British Airways has introduced larger aircraft to operate the slots and has operated with higher load factors, which particularly underpinned the traffic growth in 2013. Over the last ten years there has also been a significant shift in traffic mix with substantial growth in emerging market long haul routes such as the Far East, Middle East and India as well as the mature North Atlantic market. Long haul traffic has increased 33 per cent. from 28.1 million passengers in 2003 to 37.4 million passengers in 2013, with almost four million additional North Atlantic passengers and over five million additional passengers on other long haul routes. European and domestic UK traffic was virtually identical in terms of absolute passenger numbers at the beginning and end of this period although its share of Heathrow’s total traffic declined from 56 per cent. of total traffic in 2003 to 48 per cent. in 2013. ----- This shift in mix has been driven by a number of factors including the strong economic development of emerging markets. North American traffic growth has been driven by three distinct factors since 2002, namely recovery from the terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001, the first phase of Open Skies becoming effective from March 2008 and the success of joint transatlantic services launched by British Airways and American Airlines from March 2011. The relative underperformance of domestic and European traffic has reflected increased use of alternative transport on domestic routes as well as other short haul routes such as Paris and Brussels (such as Eurostar train services); and airlines rotating their scarce slots to the more lucrative long haul market. Heathrow remained resilient through the global economic downturn with passenger traffic declining only 1.4 per cent. to 66.9 million in 2008 and 1.5 per cent. to 65.9 million in 2009 with a cumulative reduction in rolling annual traffic from peak to trough in this period of 3.4 per cent. This was amongst the most resilient performances of major airports in Europe and North America, thought to be influenced by two factors discussed above namely operating at full capacity, which implies a certain level of unfulfilled demand, and Heathrow’s high exposure to long haul traffic, the faster growing segment of the global aviation market.

139,Preliminary Offerings 2014.md,963,UK AIRPORT CAPACITY,963.1,,963.1.1,,"London is the largest air travel origin and destination market in the world, and Heathrow airport is the primary airport in London and the UK’s only hub airport. The airport is capacity constrained to 480,000 permitted flight arrivals and departures annually and operates the busiest two runways worldwide. In 2013 Heathrow operated at nearly 98 per cent. of its maximum capacity. The capacity shortage has arisen principally due to a lack of consistent sustained government support for capacity expansion. Whilst there has been some free capacity at other London airports for many years, this has not been seen as a substitute for operating from Heathrow airport for network airlines given the importance of the transfer traffic dynamic of a hub airport such as Heathrow in supporting these airlines' business models. As a result, Heathrow airport continues to operate at capacity. At the end of 2012 the UK Government established the Airports Commission, chaired by Sir Howard Davies. The Commission was tasked with examining the requirement for additional airport capacity to maintain the UK’s position as Europe’s most important aviation hub. On 17 July 2013, Heathrow submitted three third runway options for the Airports Commission to consider. On 17 December 2013, the Airports Commission published its interim report on the steps needed to maintain the UK’s global hub status. The Airports Commission stated that there is a clear case for at least one net additional runway in London and the South East by 2030 and shortlisted potential sites for further analysis and assessment: 1) a 3,500 metre runway proposed by Heathrow to the north west of the airport; 2) a separate proposal by Heathrow Hub Limited to lengthen Heathrow’s existing northern runway to 6,000 metres; and 3) a new runway at Gatwick airport south of the existing runway. In addition, the Airports Commission recommended short-term actions to improve the use of existing runway capacity in the next 5 years. On 2 September 2014, the Airports Commission confirmed its decision to not add the proposal for a new hub airport in the inner Thames estuary to the shortlist of options. The commission concluded that the substantial disadvantages of the proposal collectively outweigh its potential benefits. Heathrow’s north west third runway option would raise the capacity at Heathrow to 740,000 flights a year, from the current limit of 480,000. It would cater for 130 million passengers annually compared to 80 million today, allowing the UK to compete with international rivals and providing capacity for the foreseeable future and is designed to evolve to four runways if required. The north west runway option is to the west of the short third runway proposal under the 2003 Air Transport White Paper. With a north west third runway there will be 15% fewer people within Heathrow’s noise footprint in 2030 than today. This is due to its positioning further from London, quieter new generation aircraft and changes in operating procedures. The option maintains the principle of runway alternation to provide periods of respite from noise for all communities around Heathrow. Heathrow worked with local authorities, communities and other stakeholders to refine the runway option, including public consultation which took place through February and March. Heathrow’s refreshed proposal was submitted to the Airports Commission in May 2014. This submission improves on the July 2013 submission with proposals for further reduction of noise impact, improved road capacity, reduced congestion impacts and faster delivery of hub capacity at a competitive world-class airport. Construction of the new runway could be completed in six years with an estimated earliest operational date of 2025 at an estimated cost of £16 billion. The proposal is based on private funding of the core airport infrastructure, investment over approximately 15 years, on the basis of an appropriate regulatory regime in place to give long-term visibility of returns to investors commensurate with risk. It is unlikely there would be material capital expenditure related to any new runway at Heathrow during the current regulatory period ending on 31 December 2018. ----- Heathrow will continue to engage the CAA, the Airports Commission and other stakeholders on the proposals.

The airport is capacity constrained to 480,000 permitted flight arrivals and departures annually and operates the busiest two runways worldwide. In 2013 Heathrow operated at nearly 98 per cent. of its maximum capacity. The capacity shortage has arisen principally due to a lack of consistent sustained government support for capacity expansion. Whilst there has been some free capacity at other London airports for many years, this has not been seen as a substitute for operating from Heathrow airport for network airlines given the importance of the transfer traffic dynamic of a hub airport such as Heathrow in supporting these airlines' business models. As a result, Heathrow airport continues to operate at capacity. At the end of 2012 the UK Government established the Airports Commission, chaired by Sir Howard Davies. The Commission was tasked with examining the requirement for additional airport capacity to maintain the UK\u2019s position as Europe\u2019s most important aviation hub. On 17 July 2013, Heathrow submitted three third runway options for the Airports Commission to consider. On 17 December 2013, the Airports Commission published its interim report on the steps needed to maintain the UK\u2019s global hub status. The Airports Commission stated that there is a clear case for at least one net additional runway in London and the South East by 2030 and shortlisted potential sites for further analysis and assessment: 1) a 3,500 metre runway proposed by Heathrow to the north west of the airport; 2) a separate proposal by Heathrow Hub Limited to lengthen Heathrow\u2019s existing northern runway to 6,000 metres; and 3) a new runway at Gatwick airport south of the existing runway. In addition, the Airports Commission recommended short-term actions to improve the use of existing runway capacity in the next 5 years. On 2 September 2014, the Airports Commission confirmed its decision to not add the proposal for a new hub airport in the inner Thames estuary to the shortlist of options. The commission concluded that the substantial disadvantages of the proposal collectively outweigh its potential benefits. Heathrow\u2019s north west third runway option would raise the capacity at Heathrow to 740,000 flights a year, from the current limit of 480,000. It would cater for 130 million passengers annually compared to 80 million today, allowing the UK to compete with international rivals and providing capacity for the foreseeable future and is designed to evolve to four runways if required. The north west runway option is to the west of the short third runway proposal under the 2003 Air Transport White Paper. With a north west third runway there will be 15% fewer people within Heathrow\u2019s noise footprint in 2030 than today. This is due to its positioning further from London, quieter new generation aircraft and changes in operating procedures. The option maintains the principle of runway alternation to provide periods of respite from noise for all communities around Heathrow. Heathrow worked with local authorities, communities and other stakeholders to refine the runway option, including public consultation which took place through February and March. Heathrow\u2019s refreshed proposal was submitted to the Airports Commission in May 2014. This submission improves on the July 2013 submission with proposals for further reduction of noise impact, improved road capacity, reduced congestion impacts and faster delivery of hub capacity at a competitive world-class airport. Construction of the new runway could be completed in six years with an estimated earliest operational date of 2025 at an estimated cost of \u00a316 billion. The proposal is based on private funding of the core airport infrastructure, investment over approximately 15 years, on the basis of an appropriate regulatory regime in place to give long-term visibility of returns to investors commensurate with risk. It is unlikely there would be material capital expenditure related to any new runway at Heathrow during the current regulatory period ending on 31 December 2018. ----- Heathrow will continue to engage the CAA, the Airports Commission and other stakeholders on the proposals.

139,Preliminary Offerings 2014.md,967,PENSIONS,967.1,,967.1.1,,"The Heathrow Airport Holdings Group operates a number of pension schemes for its employees. The main schemes, which are operated by LHR Airports, the employing company within the Heathrow Airport Holdings Group and sponsor of the related pension schemes, comprise a defined benefit pension scheme that closed to employees joining LHR Airports after 15 June 2008 (the “Pension Scheme”) and a defined contribution pension scheme that employees joining LHR Airports since 16 June 2008 are eligible to join. There is also a separate defined contribution pension scheme for employees of Heathrow Express. Under the terms of the Shared Services Agreement, Group companies make monthly cash payments into the Pension Scheme determined by the latest agreement made with the trustees of the Pension Scheme. Employer contributions into the defined contribution pension scheme are determined simply as a percentage of pensionable salary. Under the terms of the Shared Services Agreement, Group companies are also liable to fund their share of any deficit in the Pension Scheme, if requested by LHR Airports. The Pension Scheme also has a right to receive up to £284 million of the proceeds of an enforcement of the security granted by the Senior Borrower Group, which right ranks pari passu with the Class A bonds. The Pension Scheme is administered by a board of trustees comprising three employee representatives, one pensioner representative and four LHR Airports nominated trustees. In addition, the Law Debenture Trust Company provides an independent trustee. As at 30 June 2014, the Pension Scheme had 4,644 current members, 8,619 pensioners (including pensions paid to surviving partners and dependents) and 5,075 deferred pensioners. The most recent triennial valuation of the Pension Scheme was undertaken by its trustee as at 30 September 2010 and indicated a scheme deficit at that date of £275 million calculated using the trustees’ actuarial assumptions. As part of the triennial valuation process, agreement was reached between LHR Airports and the Heathrow Airport Holdings Group Pension Trustee that the level of employer contribution for three years from 1 January 2012 would initially be £97 million per year, comprising £73 million relating to future service benefits and a £24 million contribution intended to eliminate the Pension Scheme’s deficit by 31 December 2020. Contribution to future service benefits was reduced to £63 million following the disposal of Edinburgh and Stansted airports. All but approximately £10 million of the annual contribution is met by Heathrow. Discussions are currently underway regarding the triennial valuation as at 30 September 2013 that is expected to result in agreement by the end of 2014. In any sale of a Group company, a payment can be made to the Pension Scheme in an amount not exceeding the amount specified in the Shared Services Agreement in order to bring an end to the relevant company’s pension funding obligations. The cost to the Group of contributions to defined contribution pension schemes in 2013 was approximately £5 million.

Since the start of the current regulatory period, the maximum allowable yield changes from 1 January each year by RPI +/- X per cent. based on RPI from the previous April. In setting the price cap the CAA will take its own view of the scope for future efficiency savings, the appropriate level of capital expenditure and the rate of growth in demand for airport services. While the price cap places a limit on the increase in the airport charges yield, Heathrow has the discretion on whether to price to the maximum permitted level. Therefore, Heathrow can choose to price charges below the cap. For example, if there is unused capacity, Heathrow could choose to set prices below the cap in order to stimulate demand. ----- The price control conditions set by the CAA include the following components for the maximum allowable yield: - The “S factor” is mechanism designed to adjust the maximum allowable yield within the relevant Quinquennium for either additional or reduced security costs incurred as a result of new UK or European Commission security directives issued by or through the UK Government. For the current regulatory period, the adjustment enables Heathrow to pass through 90 per cent. of any additional (or reduced) security costs around a deadband of £19 million. - The “K factor” is designed to correct for any under recovery (dilution) or over recovery (concentration) in airport charges compared to the annual maximum allowable yield per passenger. Under or over recoveries generally arise due to changes in traffic mix or average loads compared to those forecast at the time prices were set for the relevant year. For example, an increase in long haul departing passengers would result in yield concentration leading to an over recovery. Conversely, an increase in average load factors or the proportion of transfer passengers would cause yield dilution. The K factor adjustment is applied to the maximum allowable yield calculation two years after the year in which it is incurred and therefore can be carried forward to the following Quinquennium. - There is a capital expenditure “trigger” term built into the price control for Heathrow, with provision for the maximum allowable yield to be reduced if specified project milestones are not delivered on time. - There is a service quality rebate scheme at Heathrow which sets defined service standards for a range of services and facilities.

Since the start of the current regulatory period, the maximum allowable yield changes from 1 January each year by RPI +/- X per cent. based on RPI from the previous April. In setting the price cap the CAA will take its own view of the scope for future efficiency savings, the appropriate level of capital expenditure and the rate of growth in demand for airport services. While the price cap places a limit on the increase in the airport charges yield, Heathrow has the discretion on whether to price to the maximum permitted level. Therefore, Heathrow can choose to price charges below the cap. For example, if there is unused capacity, Heathrow could choose to set prices below the cap in order to stimulate demand. ----- The price control conditions set by the CAA include the following components for the maximum allowable yield: - The \u201cS factor\u201d is mechanism designed to adjust the maximum allowable yield within the relevant Quinquennium for either additional or reduced security costs incurred as a result of new UK or European Commission security directives issued by or through the UK Government. For the current regulatory period, the adjustment enables Heathrow to pass through 90 per cent. of any additional (or reduced) security costs around a deadband of \u00a319 million. - The \u201cK factor\u201d is designed to correct for any under recovery (dilution) or over recovery (concentration) in airport charges compared to the annual maximum allowable yield per passenger. Under or over recoveries generally arise due to changes in traffic mix or average loads compared to those forecast at the time prices were set for the relevant year. For example, an increase in long haul departing passengers would result in yield concentration leading to an over recovery.

Prospective purchasers who are in any doubt as to their tax position or who may be subject to tax in a jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom should consult their professional advisors.
