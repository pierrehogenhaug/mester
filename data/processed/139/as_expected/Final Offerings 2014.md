 Issue price: 100 per cent.

Heathrow Finance plc, a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (the “Issuer”), will

mature on 3 March 2025. If the Issuer undergoes a change of control, it may be required to offer to purchase the Notes
from investors.

The Notes will be general secured senior obligations of the Issuer. The Notes will be secured by fixed and floating

intermediate holding company of the Group (as defined below).

This Prospectus includes information on the terms of the Notes, including redemption and repurchase prices and

Notes to be admitted to the official list of the UK Listing Authority (the “Official List”) and to the London Stock
Exchange plc (the “London Stock Exchange”) for the Notes to be admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange's
Regulated Market (the “Market”). The Market is a regulated market for the purposes of the Markets in Financial
Instruments Directive 2004/39/EC.

The Notes will initially be represented by a temporary global note (the “Temporary Global Note”), without interest

Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, societe anonyme (“Clearstream, Luxembourg”).
Interests in the Temporary Global Note will be exchangeable for interests in a permanent global note (the “Permanent

Heathrow Airport Holdings is indirectly owned by investment vehicles controlled or managed by Ferrovial S.A.
(25.00%), Qatar Holding LLC (20.00%), Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (13.29%), the Government of
Singapore Investment Corporation (11.88%), Alinda Capital Partners (11.18%), China Investment Corporation
(10.00%) and Universities Superannuation Scheme (8.65%).

Heathrow generates two primary types of income:

- aeronautical income (£1,523 million or 62 per cent. of total income in 2013), which is generated from fees
charged to airlines for use of its facilities for flight and passenger activities and is subject to the CAA’s price
caps; and

- non-aeronautical income (£951 million or 38 per cent. of total income in 2013), which is taken into account by
the CAA in setting maximum aeronautical yields and is generated mainly from retail concession fees, car
parking income, Heathrow Express rail operations and other services supplied by Heathrow.

Heathrow is subject to economic regulation by the Civil Aviation Authority (the “CAA”). The CAA sets caps on the
amount that Heathrow can charge airlines for using its facilities.

The price caps are set for a five-year period or Quinquennium, which can be extended by one year. This price setting
mechanism provides significant cash flow predictability within each Quinquennium and provides substantial explicit
protection against costs resulting from new security regulations.

The price caps take into account Heathrow’s forecast revenues (both aeronautical and non-aeronautical) and costs as
well as allowing recovery of capital costs and a return on capital. The return on capital is based on its opening RAB and
its forecast capital expenditure for the Quinquennium. As for other regulated utilities in the UK, the RAB acts as a unit
of regulatory value and does not correspond to statutory asset values. The RAB is adjusted each year principally for
capital expenditure, RPI inflation, regulatory depreciation and proceeds of disposals.

The regulated price-setting mechanism provides significant income predictability and cash flow visibility within each
regulatory period as well as protection against longer-term cost and revenue risks. The current Quinquennium for
Heathrow, Q6, lasts from 1 April 2014 to 31 December 2018 in order to align Heathrow’s financial and regulatory
years.

**FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE**
The Group has continued to deliver a strong financial performance in recent years due to a combination of:

- Heathrow delivering record traffic and improvement in service standards;

- strong retail performance reflecting enhancements to the passenger experience such as refurbishment of
Terminal 3 and extension of retail facilities in Terminal 5;

- Heathrow's tariff profile up to March 2014 allowing maximum allowable yield per passenger to increase
annually by 7.5 per cent. above the rate of RPI inflation; and

- a continuing focus on operational improvement and cost control.

As a result, in 2013 the Group saw revenue and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations increase 11.3 per cent.
and 22.3 per cent. respectively.

This strong underlying performance has continued into 2014 with Heathrow’s Adjusted EBITDA for the first six
months of the year increasing by 17.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2013. Heathrow’s financial performance
in 2014 has reflected in particular record traffic levels, increasing aeronautical tariffs and cost control.

The financial information presented below treats Stansted as a discontinued operation.

Please also see “Selected Historical Financial Information” on page 31.

**Revenue**
The table below details the Group's revenue for the years ended 31 December 2012 and 2013 as well as for the six
months ended 30 June 2013 and 2014 (“6M 2013” and “6M 2014”).

**Total .........................................................................................** **1,149** **1,234** **2,222** **2,474**

- As a result of the change in the reporting of certain intra-group services from 1 January 2013, the 2013 and 6M 2014 amounts for “Other income”

are not directly comparable with the 2012 and 6M 2013 amounts, respectively.

**Aeronautical income**
Aeronautical income includes airport fees and other traffic charges paid by airlines to Heathrow. Aeronautical income is
subject to a maximum allowable yield per passenger determined by the CAA.

Aeronautical income increased by £243 million (19.0 per cent.) from £1,280 million in 2012 to £1,523 million in 2013
and increased by £74 million (10.7 per cent.) from £693 million in 6M 2013 to £767 million in 6M 2014. The increase
was driven principally by the tariff formula at Heathrow under which the maximum allowable yield per passenger was
permitted to increase by up to RPI + 7.5 per cent. per annum until 31 March 2014, supported by modest increases in
passenger traffic.

**Retail income**
Heathrow generates retail income primarily from retail concession fees and car parking income. Third parties operate all
bars, restaurants, specialist shops, duty-free and tax-free outlets and other paid merchant services at the airport under
concessions granted by Heathrow. Heathrow also generates retail income or fees from other services such as
advertising, car rental and bureaux de change.

Heathrow’s retail business has performed strongly in recent years with the key performance indicator for the business,
net retail income per passenger, increasing by £0.16 (2.6 per cent.) from £6.21 in 2012 to £6.37 in 2013. It also
increased by £0.14 (2.2 per cent.) from £6.28 in 6M 2013 to £6.42 in 6M 2014. This performance has reflected in
particular growth in income from car parking and car rental. Growth in income from duty-free and tax-free and airside
specialist shops has been more modest than in preceding years and likely to have been impacted by a number of factors
such as an increased proportion of lower spending EU passengers in 2013 and both a strengthening of sterling and
refurbishment and extension of Terminal 5’s retail facilities in 2014. The refurbishment and extension of Terminal 5’s
retail facilities is expected to be completed by the end of 2014.

**Other income**
Heathrow generates other income from the provision of operational facilities and utilities to airlines and other
businesses operating at the airport. This income includes rental of systems such as check-in and baggage-handling
facilities and charges for providing electricity, telecommunications and water services. Heathrow also generates rental
income from property such as cargo storage, aircraft hangars, maintenance facilities and office premises and income
from the Heathrow Express rail service.

**Adjusted operating costs – ordinary excluding depreciation and amortisation**
The Group's adjusted operating costs – ordinary excluding depreciation, amortisation and exceptional items decreased
by £5 million (0.5 per cent.) from £1,069 million in 2012 to £1,064 million in 2013 and by £22 million (4.0 per cent.)
from £551 million in 6M 2013 to £529 million in 6M 2014.

In 2013, the reduction in adjusted operating costs reflected primarily lower rents and rates and general expenses. The
lower adjusted operating costs in 6M 2014 versus 6M 2013 relate primarily to reduced employment costs.

**Financing of the Group**

**_Overview_**

The Group maintains a diversified multi-product, multi-currency funding platform which currently incorporates bond
and bank debt in Sterling, Euros, Dollars, Swiss Francs and Canadian Dollars. As at 30 June 2014, the Group had
consolidated nominal net debt of £12,420 million of which £11,662 million was within the Issuer’s subsidiaries and
£758 million was at the Issuer.

Debt within the Issuer’s subsidiaries comprised £10,212 million in Class A net debt (Class A bonds are rated A- by
S&P and Fitch) and an additional £1,450 million in Class B debt (Class B bonds are rated BBB by S&P and Fitch)
which ranks behind the Class A debt. As at 30 June 2014, the Issuer itself had £758 million in net debt which is serviced
from its subsidiaries’ cashflows but is structurally subordinated to the Class A and B debt within its subsidiaries.

Please see “Debt, gearing and interest cover statistics” on page 34.

**_Financing at Heathrow Finance plc_**

The Issuer has a combination of loan and bond financing in place which comprises:

- a £77.5 million loan facility with a final maturity of 2019 (the “2011 Issuer Facility”);

- an £85 million loan facility with a final maturity of 2016 (the “2013 Issuer Facility” and, together with the 2011
Issuer Facility, the “Issuer Facilities”);

- £325 million notes due 2017 (the “2017 Notes”); and

- £275 million notes due 2019 (the “2019 Notes”).

The issuance of Notes described in this Prospectus will rank pari passu with the Issuer Facilities, the 2017 Notes and
the 2019 Notes and will benefit from the same security package.

**_Financing at the Senior Borrower Group_**

The Senior Borrower Group’s finances its activities through a mix of senior (Class A) and junior (Class B) bank and
bond debt in a variety of tenors, formats and currencies. It hedges a significant proportion of its interest rate, inflation
and currency exposures under an agreed hedging policy.

Bonds are issued by Heathrow Funding Limited under its bond issuance programme, which was established in 2008.

The Senior Borrower Group also has access to various loan facilities, including revolving and liquidity facilities which
have significant undrawn balances.


-----

The Senior Borrower Group uses the proceeds of bond issues and of loan drawings for its general corporate purposes,
including to fund operating and capital expenditure, to pay interest and principal on its bonds and loans and, subject to
the terms of its financing agreements, to make distributions to enable the servicing of other parts of the Heathrow
Airport Holdings Group’s capital structure including payments of interest and principal related to the Issuer’s debt and
to enable the payment of dividends to the Heathrow Airport Holdings Group’s ultimate shareholders. In recent years the
Group has been actively refinancing its loan facilities and significantly extending its debt maturity profile particularly
through issuance in the debt capital markets.

As at 30 June 2014, the Issuer’s subsidiaries had outstanding £11.6 billion in nominal debt under 30 separate bond
issues with scheduled maturities between 2014 and 2049. At the same date, the Issuer’s subsidiaries had in place:

- £1,400 million in revolving credit facilities with a final maturity of June 2017 (fully undrawn);

- a £175 million revolving credit facility with a final maturity of December 2015 (fully undrawn);

- a £100 million revolving credit facility with a final maturity of April 2018 of which £50 million was drawn;

- a £100 million working capital facility with a final maturity of June 2017 (fully undrawn); and

- £196 million in amortising loans from the European Investment Bank (final maturity 2022).

The Group’s debt maturity profile (determined on a nominal basis and excluding £527 million in index-linked
derivative accretion), as at 30 June 2014, is as shown in the table below.

**_Liquidity_**

At 30 June 2014, the Group had £2,452 million in cash resources and undrawn loan facilities. These included £1,725
million available under revolving credit and working capital facilities and £727 million in cash, cash equivalents and
authorised investments. Since 30 June 2014, the Group has completed nearly £400 million in further long term debt
financing.

The Group is cash positive with £1,407 million cash from operating activities in 2013.

Taking into account its cash resources, undrawn loan facilities and its projected operating cash flows, the Group expects
to have sufficient resources to meet all its liquidity requirements, including refinancing maturing bonds and loans, until
the end of 2016. Under the Senior Borrower Group Indebtedness common terms agreement (the “CTA”), it is required
that projected cashflow from operations after deducting finance charges together with cash at hand and any undrawn
balances under committed facilities exceeds 12 months’ projected capital expenditure.

**Ring-fencing of the Group**

Heathrow Airport Holdings has put in place a ring-fenced long-term financing platform for the Group. This financing
platform has been designed to support senior, junior and holding company bank and bond debt and associated hedging.


-----

The Noteholders will, like the Class A and Class B bondholders, benefit from a range of structural enhancements,
including the following:

- the Group is insulated from Heathrow Airport Holdings insolvency:

– creditors have full security over both the Issuer and its parent Heathrow (DSH) Limited including a
pledge of shares in both the Issuer and Security Parent;

– subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, Noteholders have the power to appoint an administrative receiver
to Heathrow (DSH) Limited and so prevent insolvency of the Issuer;

- there are no legal, economic or cash flow dependencies between the Issuer and Heathrow Airport Holdings
companies higher up the corporate structure:

– the Issuer is required to act solely as a holding company of the Security Parent, and its parent, Heathrow
(DSH) Limited, is required to act solely as a holding company for the Issuer;

– the Issuer has no other assets and no recourse or liability to other parts of the Heathrow Airport Holdings
Group;

– restrictions on transactions with the wider Heathrow Airport Holdings Group to avoid value transfer;

- an operational and financial covenant package including:

– restrictions on the Issuer's ability to distribute cash outside the Group, including restrictions on
distributions where:

        - _pro forma RAR is greater than 82 per cent. for Class A and Class B debt at Security Parent_
(compared with 85 per cent. under the CTA). This is designed to provide headroom within the
Class B debt trigger levels at Security Parent and so provide a liquidity buffer at the Issuer;

        - _pro forma RAR is greater than either 90 per cent. until such time as the 2017 Notes, the 2019_
Notes and the Issuer Facilities either mature, are repaid or consent is obtained to amend the Group
RAR restrictions, or 92.5 per cent. thereafter for debt at the Issuer;

– Noteholders benefit indirectly from the covenants (e.g. hedging policy, restrictions on activities of the
Airports and sale of key assets) which bind the Senior Borrower Group under the CTA; and

– a covenant that prevents the Senior Borrower Group agreeing to any tighter restrictions on distributions
than are currently in the CTA, so protecting the distributions which the Issuer requires to service its
indebtedness, including the Notes.

The Issuer Facilities, the 2017 Notes and the 2019 Notes have a restriction on distributions and breach of covenant
when pro forma Group RAR is greater than 90 per cent. For more details on the financing arrangements described
above, see “Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Terms and Conditions of the Notes” in this Prospectus.

**_Change in Group RAR covenant and restriction on distributions and use of proceeds of the Notes_**

Since 2010, the Group has targeted maintaining gross debt at the Issuer of around 5 per cent. of the Group’s RAB over
the medium term. As at 30 June 2014, the Issuer’s gross debt was £763 million, equivalent to approximately 5.1 per
cent. of Heathrow’s RAB at that date.

The Group intends to move over the medium term to having a restriction on distributions and breach of covenant if pro
forma Group RAR is greater than 92.5 per cent., meaning that gross debt at the Issuer could increase in due course to
around 7.5 per cent. of the Group’s RAB. This is unlikely to occur in full for some time as the Issuer Facilities, the 2017
Notes and the 2019 Notes have a restriction on distributions and breach of covenant when pro forma Group RAR is
greater than 90 per cent. (as set out above). These more restrictive requirements will apply to the Issuer’s overall
indebtedness until such time as the 2017 Notes, the 2019 Notes and the Issuer Facilities either mature, are repaid or
consent is obtained to amend the Group RAR restrictions in these financings. This change is intended to provide the
Group with additional medium term flexibility to manage its capital structure.

The issuance of the Notes together with the expected use of proceeds outlined below will result in the amount of gross
debt at the Issuer being 6.0-6.5 per cent. of Heathrow’s expected RAB at the end of 2014.

The net proceeds of the issue of the Notes will be applied by the Issuer to repay part or all of the 2013 Issuer Facility, to
pay related fees and expenses, with the remainder of the net proceeds retained by the Issuer and its subsidiaries to be
used for general corporate purposes.

**KEY STRENGTHS**

Heathrow has a number of key strengths, deriving both from the commercial strength of the airport and from its status
as regulated infrastructure:

- A strong position in the South East of England, one of the world's busiest air traffic markets and a market with
growing demand for air travel and limited airport capacity.

- Heathrow is the world's third busiest airport in terms of total passengers and the busiest airport in Europe. It
enjoys a unique market position in the United Kingdom, being the country's only hub airport and handling
approximately 80 per cent. of all the UK's scheduled long-haul air traffic.

- Price regulation by the CAA, which provides significant income predictability and cash flow visibility within
each regulatory period as well as protection against longer term cost and revenue risks.

- High exposure to the fastest growing long-haul segment of the global aviation industry and the fact that it has
been operating close to its permitted capacity for a number of years provides the Group with resilience to shocks
and economic downturns.

- Income generation from a variety of sources, including aeronautical charges to airlines, concession fees from
retail operators, direct income from car parks, Heathrow Express and from various ancillary services such as
baggage handling, passenger check-in and the rental of airport premises.

- Service of a range of market segments, including business and leisure travellers, origin and destination and
transfer passengers, long- and short-haul routes, and a diversified range of major airlines.

**COMMERCIAL STRATEGY**

Heathrow’s strategy is focused on developing its position as the UK’s direct connection to the world and Europe’s hub
airport of choice.

To support and develop Heathrow’s role as a hub, the Group will continue enabling the success of the major network
airlines operating at Heathrow by investing in further capacity, operational flexibility and resilience at sustainable
charges for airline customers.

Heathrow offers a compelling, competitive range of routes and frequencies for the large London origin and destination
aviation market. For both local and transfer passengers, Heathrow is working continuously to make every journey better
through improved service standards to ensure it remains passengers’ preferred airport. Improving the passenger
experience is supported by ongoing investment in modern airport facilities and operating processes.

the 2019 Notes and any hedging creditors. The Trustee will accede as an
additional bond creditor to the Intercreditor Agreement on or about the issue
date of the Notes. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the debt held by
the secured creditors that are secured by the Transaction Security, including
the holders of the Notes, will rank pari passu without any preference between
any class of such secured debt. The Intercreditor Agreement also sets out,
among other things, the circumstances under which the security documents
may be enforced by the security agent on behalf of secured creditors, the
application of enforcement proceeds and the circumstances under which the
Transaction Security may be shared on a pari passu basis with additional
third-party creditors. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor
_Agreement”._

**_Modification, Waiver and Substitution_** The Trustee may, without the consent of holders of the Notes, agree to (i) any
modification of (subject to certain exceptions), or to the waiver or
authorisation of any breach or proposed breach of, any of the provisions of
the Notes, the Trust Deed or the Agency Agreement or (ii) the substitution in
place of the Issuer as principal debtor under the Notes, in each case in the
circumstances and subject to the conditions described in Conditions 17
(Waiver, Authorisation and Determination) and 19 (Substitution).

**_Use of Proceeds_** The net proceeds of the issue of the Notes will be applied by the Issuer to
repay part or all of the 2013 Issuer Facility, to pay related fees and expenses,

**RISK FACTORS**

**_The following sets out certain aspects of the Group's financing documentation and the activities of the Group about_**
**_which prospective holders of the Notes should be aware. The occurrence of any of the events described below could have_**
**_a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Issuer or the Group and_**
**_could lead to, among other things, non-payment of amounts under the Notes._**

_This section of the Prospectus describes all material risks that are known to the Group as at the date of this Prospectus._
_This section of the Prospectus is not intended to be exhaustive and prospective holders of the Notes should read the_
_detailed information set out elsewhere in this document, including the documents incorporated by reference, prior to_
_making any investment decision. Further, prospective holders of the Notes should take their own legal, financial,_
_accounting, tax and other relevant advice as to the structure and viability of an investment in the Notes._

_In addition, whilst the various structural elements described in this document are intended to lessen some of the risks_
_discussed below for holders of the Notes, there can be no assurance that these measures will ensure that the holders of the_
_Notes receive payment of interest or repayment of principal from the Issuer in respect of such Notes on a timely basis or at_
_all._

**COMMERCIAL RISKS**

**The Group’s aeronautical income could decline as a result of a reduction in flights, passengers or other factors**
**outside the Group’s control.**

The Group generates aeronautical income from airport fees and traffic charges. These charges are regulated and principally
levied on the basis of passenger numbers, maximum total aircraft weight and the length of time for which an aircraft is
parked at the airport. The charges are also linked to the rate of inflation, which is liable to change. There are no specific
operating contracts with the airlines operating at Heathrow airport. There can therefore be no assurance as to the level of
the Group’s future aeronautical income from any one or more airline operators. Decisions by, legal disputes with, financial
difficulties at, or the failure of, a significant airline customer, or the withdrawal of their landing rights, could lead to a
reduction in flights and passenger numbers and/or failure or delay in recovering airport fees or landing charges. The effect
of decisions by or events at airlines that have a major presence at Heathrow airport (such as British Airways which in 2013
accounted for approximately 43 per cent. of the airport’s aeronautical income) could have a material adverse effect on the
Group.

The number of passengers using Heathrow airport may be affected by a number of other factors, including:

- macroeconomic events (including changes in fuel prices and currency exchange rates) whether affecting the global
economy, the UK economy or the Greater London economy in which Heathrow airport is based (which have for
instance caused a decrease in demand during the recent financial crisis and recession);

- competition from UK and non-UK airports;

- wars; riots or political action;

- industrial action, for instance the strikes that affected British Airways in 2010;

- an increase in airfares due to increased airline costs;

- decisions by airlines regarding the number, type and capacity of aircraft (including the mix of premium and
economy seats), as well as the routes on which particular aircraft are utilised;

- health scares;

- disruptions caused by natural disasters, for example the closure of airspace due to a volcanic eruption in Iceland in
2010;

- adverse weather at Heathrow airport or other airports, such as the unusual weather conditions experienced in the
northern hemisphere in December 2010, which caused over 4,000 flights to be cancelled and caused significant
impact to airline schedules globally;

- acts of terrorism or cybersecurity threats;


-----

changes in domestic or international regulation, for instance international trade liberalisation developments such as
Open Skies;

- the quality of services and facilities, including the impact of construction projects; and

- the development of efficient and viable alternatives to air travel, including the improvement or expansion of
existing surface transport systems, the introduction of new transport links or technology and the increased use of
communications technology.

A decrease in the number of passengers using Heathrow airport as a result of the factors noted above could have a material
adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**A decrease in passenger numbers or other factors outside the Group’s control could reduce non-aeronautical**
**income.**

The Group’s principal sources of non-aeronautical income include retail concession fees and car parking income, property
rental income and income from the provision of operational facilities and utilities.

Retail concession fees are driven by passenger numbers and propensity of passengers to spend in the shops at Heathrow
airport. As noted above, there is a variety of factors which could adversely affect the number of passengers using
Heathrow airport. Levels of retail income at the airport may also be affected by changes in the mix of long- and short-haul
and transfer and origin and destination passengers; economic factors, including exchange rates and changes in duty free
regimes; retail tenant failures; lower retail yields on lease re-negotiations; redevelopments or reconfiguration of retail
facilities at Heathrow airport, which can lead to a temporary or permanent decline in retail concession fees; reduced
competitiveness of the airport retail offering; stricter hand luggage and other carry on restrictions; and reduced shopping
time as a result of more rigorous and time consuming security procedures. Car parking income could be reduced as a result
of increased competition from other modes of transport to Heathrow airport, such as buses and trains, as well as increased
competition from off-site car parks. Other non-aeronautical income could be reduced as a result of a decrease in demand
from airport users, such as car rental operators and airlines leasing check-in counters. Any of these factors could have a
material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**The Group could be subject to terrorism and/or increased security requirements.**

The UK Government currently assesses the international terrorism threat to mainland Britain as “Severe”, the second
highest threat level on the government’s risk assessment scale. Heathrow airport operates within a stringent and complex
security regime as required by the Government, which has imposed additional security measures from time to time, for
example following the discovery of terrorist plots in August 2006 and December 2009. An incident in 2010 involving
cargo aircraft led to additional measures for the cargo industry only. The consequences of any future terrorist action or
threat may include cancellation or delay of flights, fewer airlines and passengers using Heathrow airport, liability for
damage or loss and the costs of repairing damage.

The implementation of additional security measures at Heathrow airport in the future could lead to additional limitations
on airport capacity or retail space, overcrowding, increases in operating costs and delays to passenger movement through
the airport, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**The successful implementation of the Group’s capital investment programme could be affected by unanticipated**
**construction and planning issues.**

The Group’s capital investment programme includes major construction projects at Heathrow airport and is subject to a
number of risks. For example, if the Group is not able to achieve a consensus amongst its airline customers in support of
capital investment projects, this could affect the willingness of the CAA to include the costs of such projects in the RAB.
Difficulties in obtaining any requisite permits, consents, including environmental consents, licences, planning permissions,
compulsory purchase orders or easements could adversely affect the design or increase the cost of the capital expenditure
projects or delay or prevent the completion of a project or the commencement of its commercial operation. Although
contractors typically share in cost and schedule risks, the Group may face higher than expected construction costs and
delays, not all of which may be permitted by the CAA to be included in Heathrow’s RAB, and possible shortages of
equipment, materials and labour due to the number of major construction projects in the London area.

The commencement of commercial operation of a newly constructed facility may also give rise to start up problems, such
as the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes or lack of readiness of airline operators, closure of facilities and
disruptions of operations. The Group’s construction contracts may contain restricted remedies or limitations on liability
such that any such sums claimed or amounts paid may be insufficient to cover the financial impact of breach of contract.
The ability of contractors to meet their financial or other liabilities cannot be assured.


-----

The failure of the Group to recognise, plan for and manage the extent of the impact of construction projects could result in
projects overrunning budgets, operational disruptions, capital expenditure trigger rebates to airlines, unsatisfactory
facilities at Heathrow airport, safety and security performance deficiencies and higher than expected operating costs. Any
of these could affect Heathrow’s day-to-day operations and, consequently, have a material adverse effect on the Group’s
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**The Group companies face potential secondary liabilities as members of the Heathrow Airport Holdings Group.**

The Group is part of the larger Heathrow Airport Holdings Group. The Group could, in certain circumstances, face
secondary liabilities in respect of tax or pension obligations of other Heathrow Airport Holdings Group entities which
could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**Incidents could occur at Heathrow airport.**

Airports are exposed to the risk of incidents, including accidents, as a result of a number of factors, including extreme
weather conditions, equipment failure, human error and terrorist activities. These incidents could result in injury or loss of
human life, damage to airport infrastructure and short or long term closure of Heathrow airport’s facilities and may have
an impact on passenger traffic levels, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**The Group’s insurance coverage might not be adequate or available in all circumstances.**

The Group benefits from insurance cover to protect against key insurable risks including terrorism and business
interruption. Cover may not be adequate to cover lost income, reinstatement costs, increased expenses or other liabilities.
Moreover, there can be no assurance that if insurance cover is cancelled or not renewed, replacement cover will be
available at commercially reasonable rates or at all.

The Group may not have, or may cease to have, insurance cover if the loss is not covered under, or is excluded from, an
insurance policy including by virtue of a deductible applying, exhaustion of applicable cover limits or a policy operating as
an excess policy or if the relevant insurer successfully avails itself of defences available to it, such as breach of disclosure
duties, breach of policy condition or misrepresentation.

Insurance cover for the Group is currently, and may in the future be, provided by a combination of insurance market
entities and captive insurance companies owned by, or affiliated with, Heathrow Airport Holdings or its ultimate
shareholders. Any of these insurers could cease to offer current insurance cover, become insolvent or lose their licences or
authorisations. Any failure to obtain insurance or to collect under relevant insurance policies could have a material adverse
effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**The Operating Companies could be subject to periodic increase in pension cash contributions in the future.**

Under the Shared Services Agreement, LHR Airports is entitled to pass a proportional amount of its pension costs on to
Heathrow and Heathrow Express. The costs of the pension schemes may vary from time to time (for instance as a result of
fluctuation in investment values or as a result of changes to actuarial assumptions). The Group expects pension costs,
including the costs of reducing any deficit, to be treated by the CAA as operating costs in setting price caps, but there is no
guarantee that the CAA will do so.

As at 30 June 2014, the Heathrow Airport Holdings Group defined benefit pension scheme showed an accounting deficit
of £144 million, of which £128 million, or approximately 1.0 per cent. of Heathrow’s RAB at that date, was attributable to
the Group. The Heathrow Airport Holdings Group Pension Trustee is a Borrower Secured Creditor pursuant to the STID
and ranks equally in an amount up to approximately £284 million with senior (Class A) debt. The extent of any deficit or
surplus to the Heathrow Airport Holdings Group defined benefit pension scheme, which may vary significantly from one
accounting period to another, results from factors outside the control of the Group.

The most recent triennial valuation of Heathrow Airport Holdings defined benefit pension scheme (as at 30 September
2010) resulted in an increase to the Group’s pension cash contributions of approximately £15 million per annum.
Subsequently, following the disposal of Edinburgh airport and Stansted airport, these contributions decreased by
approximately £10 million per annum, and are now £87 million per annum. Increases in the Group’s pension cash
contributions could, either because they take effect mid-Quinquennium or because they are not fully taken into account by
the CAA in setting price caps, have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.


-----

**The Group faces a number of operational risks outside its control.**

The operation of an airport is a complex undertaking that is subject to a number of factors outside the control of the Group.
These factors include weather conditions, variable aircraft movements and traffic congestion. In addition, the Secretary of
State for Transport has powers under the Airports Act to give directions to airport operators in the interests of national
security, including closure of airports. Given the nature of these factors, it is not possible to accurately predict their future
impact on airport operations from past performance, and any impact from such factors could have a material adverse effect
on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**Operations at Heathrow airport depend upon third parties, whose performance the Group is unable to control.**

The Group depends on the co-operation of a large number of third parties, including government agencies and business
partners, to provide essential functions, such as air traffic control, border control, re-fuelling, rescue and firefighting
services, utilities provision and catering. The Group's business operations may be affected if these service providers do not
adequately perform the services they are required to provide. In particular, a failure by these third parties to appropriately
respond to passenger volumes, accidents, fire, technical defects, failures in IT or data processing, may cause flight delays,
damage to facilities, and the cancellation of airport services. Any of these events or a combination of events related to the
performance of third parties could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**The Group companies enter into contracts with third parties which require them to give representations, covenants**
**and indemnities, which could expose the Group to litigation.**

The Group companies enter into contracts with third parties under which they have given or will give representations,
covenants and indemnities as part of the transactions to which the contracts relate. In connection with sales of assets or
shares, Heathrow (AH) Limited as seller has been, and is likely in the future to be, required to provide various warranties.
Entry into such contracts gives rise to a risk of litigation relating to the representations, covenants and indemnities which,
if significant, could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**The Group is dependent on LHR Airports as Shared Services Provider to operate its businesses.**

LHR Airports employs the staff assigned to Heathrow and also to the other airports owned and operated by the Heathrow
Airport Holdings Group. Pursuant to the Shared Services Agreement, LHR Airports also provides various management
services (including senior management and strategic direction), administration, cash management and operational services,
including the provision of IT services and staff, to the Operating Companies as described in more detail in “Business –
_Shared Services”. Whilst the Shared Services Agreement contains provisions that are designed to assist with the transfer of_
employees and services to the Operating Companies or a replacement services provider if the Shared Services Agreement
were terminated, there can be no assurance that transfers will be effected in a manner that does not have a material adverse
effect on the Group’s business, financial condition or results of operations.

A significant number of contracts for third party IT systems and IT support important to the Group’s operations are in the
name of LHR Airports and would be terminable by the contract counterparties if LHR Airports were to become insolvent.
Whilst steps may be taken to seek to minimise the impact of such termination provisions, and there may be commercial
reasons why the contract counterparties would not elect to terminate if they are being paid for the continued use of the
relevant IT system or IT support, there is a risk that the Group’s access to IT systems and IT support may be negatively
affected by an insolvency of LHR Airports, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**REGULATORY RISKS**

**Heathrow is subject to economic regulation by the Civil Aviation Authority, which is subject to change.**

Heathrow is subject to regulation that results in, among other things, the setting of the price caps on certain of its charges
by the CAA. The CAA published its final decision in relation to economic regulation at Heathrow airport for the period
from 1 April 2014 to 31 December 2018, Q6, on 10 January 2014 which details CAA price controls for the period and
pursuant to which the maximum allowable annual change to the yield per passenger will be RPI minus 1.5 per cent. - see
“Airport Regulation –Heathrow Price Regulation – Key Elements of the CAA’s Q6 Decision”.

There can be no assurance that the current or future price caps set by the CAA will be sufficient to allow Heathrow to
operate at a profit; nor that the present price caps will be increased or at least maintained at current levels; nor that the
methodology of the review process at subsequent reviews would not have a material adverse effect on the Group’s
business, financial condition and results of operations.


-----

The CAA has established performance linked requirements which can negatively impact aeronautical income. For
instance, the CAA can reduce the permitted yield in respect of airport charges at Heathrow airport if prescribed milestones
are not met on certain capital investment projects. Under the service quality rebate scheme at Heathrow for the current
regulatory period, failure to meet specified targets relating to, among other things, airport cleanliness, security queuing
times and stand and jetty availability can result in rebates to airline customers of up to 7 per cent. of airport charges. See
“Airport Regulation – Heathrow Price Regulation – SQR Scheme”.

**Heathrow is subject to an economic licensing regime.**

Under the legislative framework, Heathrow operates under a licence granted by the CAA. Heathrow’s licence will remain
in force in perpetuity, however, in certain limited circumstances, such as a continued failure by Heathrow to comply with
the conditions of the licence, the licence may be revoked by the CAA. Any revocation of the licence could have a material
adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

Additionally the licence may be amended by the CAA in the future through a prescribed licence modification process.
Although this will be subject to a right of appeal by Heathrow, the licence could be amended in a way that adversely
affected the ability of the Group to finance its business at reasonable rates which could have a material adverse effect on
the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**The Group could face other regulatory and public policy changes.**

Income and/or operations at Heathrow airport could be adversely affected by changes in policies regarding route licensing,
the “use it or lose it” rule under which airlines are required to fly 80 per cent. of their slots or sacrifice them to other
airlines, changes to the conditions for the maintenance of the Heathrow airport aerodrome licence, security and safety,
immigration and border controls, airport development, environmental policy, tax, air passenger duty or the provision of
airport capacity.

The UK Government has established an independent commission, the Airports Commission, tasked with identifying and
recommending options for meeting the UK’s future aviation hub capacity requirements. In the event that this recommends
development of airports other than Heathrow airport, the approval and subsequent construction of such infrastructure could
have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**The Group faces costs related to environmental, health and safety and planning considerations.**

The Group’s business is affected by a wide variety of EU and UK environmental, health and safety and planning laws and
requirements. The Group’s existing operations may be impacted by a number of environmental and planning factors,
including those involving aircraft movements; air quality (including emissions standards); noise; energy use and
efficiency; soil and water pollution arising from airport operations; discharges and surface water drainage; land and
groundwater contamination; flooding; drought; asbestos in premises and exposure to asbestos; and waste handling,
management and disposal.

Compliance with present or future environmental, health and safety and planning requirements may be costly and timeconsuming and interfere with the Group’s existing activities and operations. The CAA has to date taken environmental
costs incurred by the Group into account in determining the RAB and in setting price caps. The CAA has not indicated that
it intends to change its policy in this regard in the future but, if it were to do so, this could have a material adverse effect on
the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**Future regulatory settlements may not allow for increased operating costs.**

Operating costs may differ from projections. There can be no assurance that future price caps set by the CAA will be
sufficient to allow Heathrow to cover its operating costs which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**FINANCING RISKS**
**The Group is subject to exposure on its hedging arrangements.**

Whilst the Group operates a hedging programme in accordance with the hedging policy under the terms of the Senior
Borrower Group Indebtedness, it is not required to fully or perfectly hedge its present or future interest rate, foreign
currency or inflation exposure and may not in practice do so. The Group is subject to the creditworthiness of, and in
certain circumstances early termination of the hedging arrangements by, hedge counterparties.

Changes in interest, foreign currency and inflation rates, and exposure to hedge counterparty risk, could have a material
adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.


-----

**Risks of High Leverage**

**A significant portion of the Group’s cash flow from operations is dedicated to debt payments.**

Because of the secured nature of its borrowings and the structure that applies to them, the Group has been able to raise
more debt than would typically be the case for an unsecured borrower. As a result, a greater portion of the Group's cash
flow from operations is dedicated to payments on its debt obligations, thus reducing its flexibility to deal with significant
financial underperformance. This may increase the Group's vulnerability to any economic downturn in its business or to
adverse industry conditions, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**Given its leverage position, the Group will need to raise further debt from time to time.**

The Group will need to raise further debt from time to time in order, among other things, to:

(a) finance future capital expenditure; and

(b) enable it to refinance indebtedness, including the Notes, as such indebtedness comes due.

There can be no assurance that the Group will be able to raise future finance on terms that are economically viable or at all.
For instance, events in the credit markets in 2007 and 2008, and regulatory uncertainty in 2009, significantly restricted the
Group’s ability to raise finance. An inability to refinance its indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on the
Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, under the terms of the Senior Borrower Group Indebtedness, if Heathrow is unable to replace a liquidity
facility under certain circumstances, it will not be permitted to incur any further indebtedness, including issuing bonds
under the multicurrency bond programme of Heathrow Funding Limited.

**Ability to incur more debt.**

The Group may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future. Neither the terms of the Notes nor the Issuer
Facilities prohibit the Group from incurring more indebtedness. If new debt is added to the Group's current debt levels, the
related risks that the Group now faces could intensify.

**OTHER LEGAL RISKS**
**General risk of change of law.**

It is possible that, whether as a result of case law or through statute, changes in law or regulations, or their interpretation or
application, may result in the Group’s debt financing arrangements as originally structured no longer having the effect
anticipated or could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations
and/or could adversely affect the rights, priorities of payments and/or treatment of holdings in the Notes for Noteholders.

**The Group faces potential secondary tax liabilities.**

Where a company fails to discharge certain tax liabilities within a specified time period, UK tax law imposes, in certain
circumstances, secondary liability for those overdue taxes on other companies that are or have been members of the same
group of companies, or are or have been under common control, for tax purposes with the company that has not discharged
its tax liabilities.

If any secondary tax liabilities arise in the Issuer or other members of the Group, which are not discharged by other
members of the wider Heathrow Airport Holdings Group, and are of significant amounts, the Issuer or other members of
the Group could be adversely affected.

The Issuer is a member of a value added tax (“VAT”) group that also includes members of the wider corporate group of
which Heathrow Airport Holdings is the representative member. As a member of that VAT group, the Issuer has exposure
to VAT liabilities of other members of the wider Heathrow Airport Holdings Group. The members of the Group are only
VAT grouped with each other and historic secondary VAT liabilities arising from the Group’s prior membership of the
wider Heathrow Airport Holdings VAT Group have timed out under the VAT Statute of Limitations.

**UK insolvency law may impact the rights of creditors including the Noteholders in certain circumstances.**

The English insolvency statutes empower English courts to make an administration order in respect of an English
company. An administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that the relevant company is or is likely to become


-----

unable to pay its debts and that the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. In

addition, the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” over the assets of an English company may appoint an administrator
out of court, provided such floating charge has become enforceable. In this case the prospective administrator must be
satisfied that the purpose of administration is reasonably likely to be achieved. An English company or the directors of
such company may also appoint an administrator out of court. The purpose of an administration comprises three parts
which must be looked at successively: rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable,
achieving a better result for the company's creditors as a whole or, if neither of those objectives are reasonably practicable,
and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realising property to make a distribution
to secured or preferred creditors.

The rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are particularly curtailed in an administration. Upon the appointment
of an administrator, no step may be taken to enforce security over the company's property, except with the consent of the
administrator or leave of the court. The same requirements for consent or leave apply to the commencement or institution
of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress or diligence) against the company or property of the
company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for leave, in light of the
hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above.

Accordingly, if the Issuer was to enter into administration proceedings, the Notes and the related security from the Issuer
could not be enforced while the relevant company was in administration, without the leave of the court or consent of the
administrator. There can be no assurance that the security agent would obtain this leave of the court or consent of the
administrator.

In addition, an administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain requirements under the
Insolvency Act 1986, dispose of the property of a company in administration. However, the general prohibition against
enforcement by secured creditors without consent of the administrator or leave of the Court, and the administrators' powers
with respect to floating and other security, do not apply to any security interest created or arising under a financial
collateral arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Agreements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (UK). A
financial collateral arrangement includes (subject to certain other conditions) a pledge over shares in a company, where
both the collateral provider and collateral taker are non-natural persons.

Under English insolvency law, the liquidator or administrator of a company may, among other things, apply to the court to
unwind a transaction entered into by such company, if such company was unable to pay its debts (as defined in section 123
of the Insolvency Act 1986) at the time of, or as a result of, the transaction and enters into liquidation or administration
proceedings within two years of the completion of the transaction. A transaction might be subject to a challenge if it was
entered into by a company “at an undervalue”, that is, it involved a gift by the company or the company received
consideration of less value than the benefit given by such company. However, a court generally will not intervene if a
company entered into the transaction in good faith for the purpose of carrying on its business and at the time it did so there
were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit such company. The Issuer believes that the Notes will
not be issued on terms which would amount to a transaction at an undervalue, that the offering is in good faith for the
purposes of carrying on the Group's business and that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction will
benefit the Group. However, there can be no assurance that the issuance of the Notes will not be challenged by a liquidator
or administrator or that a court would support this analysis.

In addition, if it can be shown that a transaction entered into by an English company was made for less than fair value and
was made to shield assets from creditors, then the transaction may be set aside as a transaction defrauding creditors. Any
person who is a “victim” of the transaction, and not just liquidators or administrators, may assert such a claim. There is no
statutory time limit within which a claim must be made and the company need not be insolvent at the time of the
transaction.

If the Issuer was to commence administration proceedings, the Notes and the related security could not be enforced while
the relevant company was in administration.

The holder of a qualifying floating charge that has been created since 15 September 2003 over all or substantially all of the
assets of an English company can generally no longer appoint an administrative receiver of that company. There is,
however, an exception to this rule that applies to certain capital markets transactions that are expected to incur at least £50
million of debt.

Any interest accruing under or in respect of the Notes for any period from the date of commencement of administration or
liquidation proceedings, to the extent not fully covered by the assets securing the Notes, could be recovered by holders of
the Notes only from any surplus remaining after payment of all other debts provided in the proceeding and interest accrued
but unpaid up to the date of the commencement of the proceeding.

Under English insolvency law, certain preferential claims, including unpaid contributions to occupational pension schemes
in respect of the twelve-month period prior to insolvency and unpaid employees' remuneration in respect of the four-month


-----

period prior to insolvency, will, while ranking behind the claims of holders of fixed security, rank ahead of floating
charges. In addition, a prescribed part of floating charge realisations (being 50 per cent. of the first £10,000 of net
realisations and 20 per cent. of the net realisations thereafter, up to a maximum of £600,000) is required to be set aside for
the benefit of unsecured creditors and, as such, ranks ahead of the relevant floating charge.

**EU Savings Directive**

Under EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income (the “EC Directive”), Member States are
required to provide to the tax authorities of other Member States details of payments of interest and other similar income
paid or secured by a person established in a Member State to, or collected by such person for, an individual resident, or
certain limited types of entity established, in that other Member State. Similar income for this purpose includes payments
on redemption of Notes representing any discount on the issue of Notes or any premium payable on redemption. However,
for a transitional period, Austria and Luxembourg may instead impose a withholding system in relation to such payments,
deducting tax at a rate of 35 per cent. Luxembourg has announced that it will no longer apply the withholding tax system
as from 1 January 2015 and will then commence automatic information exchange under the EC Directive. The transitional
period is to terminate at the end of the first full fiscal year following agreement by certain non-EU countries to the
exchange of information relating to such payments. A number of other countries and territories have adopted similar
measures to the EC Directive.

On 24 March 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted a Council Directive amending and broadening the scope of
the requirements described above. Member States are required to apply these new requirements from 1 January 2017. The
changes will expand the range of payments covered by the EC Directive, in particular to include additional types of
income payable on securities. The EC Directive will also apply a “look through approach” to payments made via certain
persons, entities or legal arrangements (including trusts and partnerships), where certain conditions are satisfied, where an
individual resident in a Member State is regarded as the beneficial owner of the payment for the purposes of the EC
Directive. This approach may in some cases apply where the person, entity or arrangement is established or effectively
managed outside of the European Union.

If a payment were to be made or collected through a Member State which has opted for a withholding system and an
amount of, or in respect of tax were to be withheld from that payment, no additional amounts would be required to be paid
to Noteholders as a result of the imposition of such withholding tax (see Condition 10 (Taxation) of the Terms and
Conditions of the Notes). The Issuer is required to maintain a paying agent in a Member State that is not obliged to
withhold or deduct tax pursuant to the EC Directive.

**RISKS RELATING TO THE NOTES**
**The Issuer depends on subsidiaries for payments.**

The Issuer is a holding company with no material assets other than the shares of its subsidiary, Heathrow (SP) Limited. All
of the Issuer's revenue is generated by the Operating Companies. Accordingly, almost all of the Issuer's cash flow is
generated by the Operating Companies. Therefore, the Issuer's ability to make payments on its indebtedness and to fund its
other obligations is dependent not only on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate cash, but also on the ability of its
subsidiaries to distribute cash to it in the form of dividends, fees, interest, loans or otherwise.

However, the Issuer's subsidiaries face various restrictions in their ability to distribute cash to the Issuer. The Senior
Borrower Group must satisfy certain restricted payment covenants and other conditions before it may make distributions to
the Issuer. Business performance and local accounting and tax rules may limit the amount of retained earnings, which is in
many cases the basis of dividend payments.

**The Notes are subordinated to liabilities of the Issuer's subsidiaries.**

The Issuer's subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any
amounts due pursuant to any debt incurred by the Issuer or to make any funds available whether by dividends, fees, loans
or other payments. Any right of the Issuer to receive any assets of any of its subsidiaries upon liquidation, dissolution,
winding up, receivership, reorganisation, assignment for the benefit of creditors, marshalling of assets and liabilities or any
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings (and the consequent right of the holders of the Issuer's indebtedness to
participate in the distribution of, or to realise proceeds from, those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of
any such subsidiary's creditors (including trade creditors and holders of debt issued by such subsidiary). Accordingly, the
Notes will be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the Issuer's subsidiaries. As at 30 June 2014, the Issuer's
subsidiaries had £14.9 billion of outstanding liabilities, including outstanding indebtedness. The terms and conditions of
the Notes do not prohibit the Issuer's subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness.


-----

**The Issuer may not be able to repurchase Notes on change of control.**

Upon a Change of Control (as defined under “Terms and Conditions of the Notes—Definitions”), the Issuer will be
required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at 101 per cent. of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
interest. The source of funds for any such purchase of the Notes will be the Issuer's available cash or cash generated from
the Operating Companies' operations or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. The Issuer
may not be able to satisfy its obligations to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control because it may not have
sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the Notes that are tendered upon a change of control.

**Liquidity of the Notes could be limited and there could be an absence of a secondary market for the Notes.**
There can be no assurance that a secondary market for the Notes will develop or, if a secondary market does develop for
any of the Notes issued after the date of this Prospectus, that it will provide any holder of Notes with liquidity or that any
such liquidity will continue for the life of the Notes. Consequently, any purchaser of the Notes must be prepared to hold
such Notes for an indefinite period of time or until final redemption or maturity of the Notes.

The liquidity and market value at any time of the Notes are affected by, among other things, the market view of the credit
risk of such Notes and will generally fluctuate with general interest rate fluctuations, general economic conditions, the
condition of certain financial markets, international political events and the performance and financial condition of the
Group.

**Rating of the Notes.**

The ratings assigned by the rating agencies to the Notes reflect only the views of the rating agencies and in assigning the
ratings the rating agencies take into consideration the credit quality of the Group and structural features and other aspects
of the transaction. There is no assurance that any such ratings will continue for any period of time or that they will not be
reviewed, revised, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of,
information or if, in the rating agencies' judgment, circumstances so warrant. If any rating assigned to the Notes is lowered
or withdrawn, the market value of the Notes may be reduced. Future events, including events affecting the Group and/or
circumstances relating to the airport industry generally, could have an adverse impact on the ratings of the Notes.

**Compliance with covenants may be affected by events beyond the Issuer’s control.**

The terms and conditions of the Notes, the 2017 Notes, the 2019 Notes and the Issuer Facilities limit the Group's ability to,
among other things, incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends or make other distributions; make investments; sell
assets; enter into agreements restricting the ability of the Issuer's subsidiaries to pay dividends; consolidate, merge, sell or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Group's assets; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and provide
security. In addition, the terms and conditions of the Notes require that, subject to certain cure rights, Group RAR may not
be greater than 92.5 per cent. as at any Relevant Testing Date and, until such time as the 2017 Notes, the 2019 Notes and
the Issuer Facilities either mature, are repaid or consent is obtained to amend the Group RAR restrictions, the terms and
conditions of the 2017 Notes, the 2019 Notes and the Issuer Facilities require that, subject to certain cure rights, Group
RAR may not be greater than 90 per cent. as at any Relevant Testing Date. The terms and conditions of the Notes, the
2017 Notes, the 2019 Notes and the Issuer Facilities also require that Group ICR may not be less than 1.0 in respect of any
Relevant Testing Period.

The ability of the Issuer to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond the Issuer's
control. If the Issuer breaches any of these covenants or restrictions, it could be in default under the Notes, the 2017 Notes,
the 2019 Notes and the Issuer Facilities. This would permit the lending banks under the Issuer Facilities to take certain
actions, including declaring all amounts that the Issuer has borrowed under the Issuer Facilities and other indebtedness to
be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. This would also result in an event of default under the
Notes, the 2017 Notes and the 2019 Notes. The lending banks could also refuse to extend further credit under the Issuer
Facilities. If the debt under the Issuer Facilities, the Notes, the 2017 Notes, the 2019 Notes or any other material financing
arrangement that the Issuer enters into were to be accelerated, the Issuer's assets may be insufficient to repay in full the
Notes and the Issuer's other indebtedness.

**The interests of ultimate shareholders may be inconsistent with interests of holders of Notes.**

Ferrovial S.A., Qatar Holding LLC, Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, the Government of Singapore Investment
Corporation, Alinda Capital Partners, China Investment Corporation and Universities Superannuation Scheme, or
investment vehicles controlled or managed on their behalf, indirectly own all of the shares of the Issuer. As a result, these
shareholders have, directly or indirectly, the power, among other things, to affect the Group's legal and capital structure
and its day-to-day operations, as well as the ability to elect and change management and to approve other changes to the
Group's operations. The interests of the Group's ultimate shareholders could conflict with interests of investors in the
Notes, particularly if the Group encounters financial difficulties or is unable to pay its debts when due. In addition, the


-----

Group s ultimate shareholders may, in the future, own businesses that directly compete with the Group in certain respects
or do business with the Group.

**Security may be insufficient to repay the Notes.**

If there is an event of default under the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be secured only by the property and assets of
Heathrow (DSH) Limited and the Issuer, which primarily consist of the share capital of the Issuer held by Heathrow
(DSH) Limited and of the share capital of Heathrow (SP) Limited held by the Issuer. To the extent that the claims of the
holders of the Notes, the claims of lenders under the Issuer Facilities and the claims of any other third party creditor that
shares in the Transaction Security in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement exceed the value of the
Transaction Security securing the Notes and other obligations, those claims will rank equally with the claims of the holders
of all other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Notes.

To the extent that other first-priority security interests, pre-existing liens, liens permitted under the terms and conditions of
the Notes and other rights encumber the Transaction Security securing the Notes, those parties may have or may exercise
rights and remedies with respect to the Transaction Security that could adversely affect the value of the security and the
ability of the security agent to realise or foreclose on the security.

**Payments in relation to the Notes are subject to the Intercreditor Agreement.**

The Trustee has acceded to an intercreditor agreement with, among others, the agents and representatives of the other
indebtedness secured by the Transaction Security, including the Issuer Facilities, the 2017 Notes, the 2019 Notes and
counterparties to certain hedging obligations. Other creditors may become parties to the Intercreditor Agreement in the
future and share in the Transaction Security. Among other things, the Intercreditor Agreement governs the enforcement of
the security documents, the sharing in any recoveries from such enforcement and the release of the Transaction Security by
the security agent.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the security agent shall act upon the instructions of the secured creditors
representing more than 50 per cent. of the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2017 Notes, the 2019 Notes,
the Notes, any additional notes, the Issuer Facilities, any new credit facilities and certain hedging creditors. The
Intercreditor Agreement further provides that, if the Trustee or holders of the Notes do not respond to a Request (as
defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) within 20 business days, the votes of holders of the Notes will not be counted for,
amongst other things, the purposes of instructing the security agent. These arrangements could be disadvantageous to the
holders of the Notes in a number of respects. For example, other creditors not subject to the Intercreditor Agreement could
commence enforcement action against the Issuer or its subsidiaries during such consultation period, the Issuer or one or
more of its subsidiaries could seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, or the value of certain collateral could
otherwise be impaired or reduced.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the security agent may release certain collateral in connection with sales of
assets pursuant to a permitted disposal or enforcement sale and in other circumstances permitted by the Trust Deed and the
Issuer Facilities. Therefore, such collateral available to secure the Notes could be reduced in connection with the sales of
assets or otherwise, subject to the requirements of the financing documents and the Trust Deed.

The Trust Deed and the Issuer Facilities permit the Issuer, in compliance with the covenants in those agreements, to incur
additional indebtedness secured by liens on the Transaction Security. The Issuer's ability to incur additional debt in the
future secured on the collateral may have the effect of diluting the ratio of the value of such Transaction Security to the
aggregate amount of the obligations secured by the Transaction Security.

**Book-entry form of Notes.**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global form and deposited with a common depositary for Euroclear and
Clearstream, Luxembourg. Interests in the Notes will trade in book-entry form only. The common depositary for Euroclear
and Clearstream, Luxembourg will be the sole holder of the Global Notes representing the Notes. Accordingly, owners of
book-entry interests must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, and non-participants in
Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg must rely on the procedures of the participant through which they own their
interests, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of Notes.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon the
Issuer's solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. The procedures to be
implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights
under the Notes.


-----

**Modification, waivers and substitution.**

The terms and conditions of the Notes contain provisions for calling meetings of holders of the Notes to consider matters
affecting their interests generally. These provisions permit defined majorities to bind all holders of the Notes including
holders of the Notes who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting and holders of the Notes who voted in a manner
contrary to the majority.

The terms and condition of the Notes also provide that the Trustee may, without the consent of holders of the Notes, agree
to (i) any modification of, or to the waiver or authorisation of any breach or proposed breach of, any of the provisions of
the Notes or the Trust Deed, (ii) determine without the consent of the holders of the Notes that any event of default or
potential event of default shall not be treated as such or (iii) the substitution in place of the Issuer in respect of the Notes of
a new group holding company, in each case in the circumstances and subject to the conditions described in “Terms and
_Conditions of the Notes”._

**INDUSTRY SOURCES AND TERMINOLOGY**

This Prospectus contains certain statistical and other information regarding Heathrow airport and the markets it serves.

Unless otherwise indicated, the information contained in this Prospectus relating to Heathrow airport’s market share and
the size of the relevant market sectors is based on Heathrow’s own internal estimates based on regulatory and analyst
reports, special surveys and information published or provided by airlines and other companies, as well as Heathrow’s
own knowledge of the market.

References in this Prospectus to Heathrow airport’s number of “passengers” refer to the sum of all arriving and
departing passengers, other than in-transit passengers.

Information in this Prospectus relating to Heathrow airport’s percentage of “international” passengers is based on the
number of its passengers arriving from and departing to destinations that are not in the United Kingdom relative to the
total number of passengers served by Heathrow airport. Information in this Prospectus relating to Heathrow airport’s
percentage of “domestic” passengers is based on the number of its passengers arriving from and departing to
destinations that are in the United Kingdom relative to the total number of passengers served by Heathrow airport.
Accordingly, the information reflects the place of origin or destination of passengers as opposed to their residence.

All information in this Prospectus relating to Heathrow airport’s percentage of “business” passengers is based on the
number of passengers who are travelling for reasons related to such passengers’ employment, based on surveyed
information, relative to the total number of passengers served by Heathrow airport. All information relating to
Heathrow's percentage of “leisure” passengers is based on the number of the airport’s passengers who are not business
passengers, relative to the total number of passengers served by Heathrow airport.

“European” flights are flights arriving from or departing to other destinations in Europe (other than domestic flights).
International “long haul” flights are all flights other than European flights and domestic flights.

“Hub airport” refers to an airport where a significant proportion of passengers transfer between flights in being
transported to their final destination.

“Transfer” traffic relates to passengers who use an airport for the sole purpose of connecting from one aircraft to
another. They are counted as both arriving and departing passengers. “Transit” or “In-transit” traffic refers to
passengers who arrive and depart on the same aircraft within 24 hours. “Point-to-point” or “origin and destination”
traffic refers to any traffic that is not transfer or transit traffic and originates from or terminates at a particular airport.

“Pier” refers to an airport passenger building which is connected to a terminal and which houses gate rooms where
passengers wait to board and disembark from their aircraft. “Satellite” refers to an airport passenger building which is
connected to a terminal and which houses not only gate rooms but also other passenger handling facilities (for example,
retail facilities) and serves as an extension to the departure lounge.

“Gate room” refers to the area where passengers board and disembark from their aircraft.

“Apron” means an area of airfield infrastructure which is typically adjacent to an airport terminal and is used for
aircraft manoeuvring and parking but is separate from the runway and taxiway system.

“Stand” means an aircraft parking stand; these can be “pier-served”, which means they are adjacent to the terminal,
enabling passengers to walk directly on and off aircraft parked on the stand via an airbridge, or they can be “remote”,
which requires passengers to either be transported by coach or walk between the stand and the terminal.

“Air transport movement” means a flight carried out for commercial purposes and includes scheduled flights
operating according to a published timetable, charter flights and all-cargo flights. Air transport movement does not
include empty positioning flights and private non-commercial flights.

“Maximum allowable yield” refers to the maximum amount of aeronautical income per passenger that Heathrow may
charge in each regulatory year for services subject to price regulation by the CAA.

References to the “Heathrow Express rail service” refer to both the express (non-stop) service and the stopping
service, Heathrow Connect, unless specifically stated otherwise.

**“ACI” means Airports Council International, the global trade representative of the world’s airports.**

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The net proceeds of the issue of the Notes will be applied by the Issuer to repay part or all of the 2013 Issuer Facility, to
pay related fees and expenses, with the remainder of the net proceeds retained by the Issuer and its subsidiaries to be
used for general corporate purposes.

The Group has historically targeted maintaining gross debt at the Issuer of approximately 5 per cent. of the Group’s
RAB over the medium term. As at 30 June 2014, gross debt at the Issuer was £763 million, equivalent to 5.1 per cent. of
Heathrow’s RAB at that date. The issuance of the Notes together with the expected use of proceeds outlined above will
result in the amount of gross debt at the Issuer being 6.0-6.5 per cent. of Heathrow’s forecast RAB at the end of 2014.

**BUSINESS**

**OVERVIEW OF HEATHROW AIRPORT**

**_Heathrow_**
London is the world’s leading global financial centre and the leading worldwide centre of commerce (sources: Z/Yen
2012; MasterCard Worldwide 2008). As London’s largest airport, and its only international hub, Heathrow is a critical
infrastructure asset not only for the UK but for global finance and commerce.

Heathrow is Europe’s busiest and the world’s third busiest airport in terms of total passengers. In 2013, Heathrow
handled approximately 80 per cent. of all the UK’s scheduled long-haul air traffic (source: CAA). In 2013, 72.3 million
passengers travelled through Heathrow airport, of which approximately 7 per cent. were domestic passengers, 52 per
cent. were international long haul passengers and 41 per cent. were European passengers. Its critical role in the global
aviation industry is underlined by the fact that six of the top ten long haul intercontinental routes globally pass through
Heathrow (source: OAG).

Heathrow airport hosts most of the world’s major international airlines and is the worldwide hub of British Airways and
the main European hub of the oneworld airline alliance. It also hosts the other two principal airline alliances of
SkyTeam and Star Alliance. In 2013, British Airways accounted for approximately 51 per cent. of Heathrow’s ATMs,
**oneworld 58 per cent. and Star Alliance 19 per cent. In 2013, approximately 63 per cent. of Heathrow’s passenger**
traffic was origin and destination traffic and 37 per cent. was transfer traffic.

Heathrow airport is served by two parallel runways which together have maximum permitted air transport movements
of 480,000 per year. In 2013, actual air transport movements totalled 469,552.

Heathrow airport provides a wide range of passenger services, including passenger-handling facilities, car parking,
shops, bars and restaurants. Heathrow airport is served by extensive bus services, London Underground services and the
dedicated Heathrow Express rail link to and from London Paddington Station.

Heathrow has maintained a strong focus in recent years on operational performance, improving the passenger
experience and investing in new and upgraded facilities. As a result, Heathrow has risen to become one of the top
performing major European hubs in terms of overall passenger satisfaction. In the first half of 2014, 79 per cent. of
passengers rated their Heathrow experience as either “very good” or “excellent” up from 39 per cent. in 2006.

Heathrow has invested £11 billion transforming the airport over the last decade, culminating in the opening of Terminal
2: the Queen’s Terminal in June 2014. The £2.5 billion investment includes a main terminal and satellite building, a
multi-storey short-stay car park and an energy centre for the campus. The terminal is home to all 23 Star Alliance
member airlines operating at Heathrow, together with Aer Lingus, germanwings and Virgin Atlantic Little Red. The
terminal complements the award winning Terminal 5 which opened in 2008 and provided additional terminal passenger
capacity for up to 30 million passengers per year. Terminal 5 has been awarded the World’s Best Airport Terminal by
Skytrax for three years in succession. Each of Heathrow’s terminals is either new or recently refurbished.

Heathrow generated revenues of £2,474 million and Adjusted EBITDA of £1,410 million for the 12 months ended 31
December 2013.

**REVENUE GENERATION AND ECONOMIC REGULATION**

Heathrow airport is subject to economic regulation by the Civil Aviation Authority. The regulatory system is designed
to allow airports to generate revenues which are sufficient to finance their operating and capital expenditure
requirements and provide a regulated rate of return on its Regulatory Asset Base. The CAA sets price caps on the
charges Heathrow can levy on airlines for using the airport’s facilities. The caps take into account Heathrow’s forecast
revenues (both aeronautical and non-aeronautical) and costs as well as allowing depreciation, recovery of capital costs
and a return on capital. Details of the regulatory regime and how the CAA determines price caps are set out in “Airport
_Regulation”._

Heathrow generates two primary types of income: aeronautical income, which is generated from fees charged to airlines
for use of the Airports’ facilities, and non-aeronautical income from a variety of sources. The chart below represents the
total revenue of Heathrow by source for 2013.

Source: Heathrow.

**_Aeronautical income_**

Aeronautical income reflects the charges levied by Heathrow on the airport’s airline customers. These charges (tariffs)
cannot exceed the regulated maximum allowable yield per passenger.

The tariff structure through which the aeronautical income is recovered from airlines includes three key elements:

_Passenger fees_

- Fees per passenger are based on the number of passengers on board an aircraft, and are levied in respect of all
departing passengers. There is no charge in respect of crew members working on flights.

- Two levels of charge based on route area: European (including domestic) and rest of world. Transfer and transit
passengers benefit from a discount.

_Landing charges_

- Landing charges are levied for substantially all aircraft (with certain diplomatic and other flights being
exempted). These are calculated in accordance with the certified maximum take-off weight of the aircraft and are
banded into categories for aircraft weighing less than and those weighing more than sixteen tonnes, which
includes nearly all commercial aircraft. These charges are adjusted, where applicable, in accordance with each
aircraft’s noise-rating, its emissions and the time of day, with landing charges at Heathrow airport being higher
during peak traffic times than off-peak traffic times.


-----

_Parking charges_

- Aircraft parking charges are levied for each 15 minute slot after 30 minutes (for narrow bodied aircraft) and 90
minutes (for wide bodied aircraft).

The CAA stipulates that the airport must charge non-passenger flights at the same rates as passenger flights. These
flights incur the minimum departure charge which applies when the departing passenger charge falls below this
minimum level.

Heathrow airport has a diverse customer base. Its main customer and airline alliance, British Airways and oneworld,
operate 48 per cent. of ATMs and 55 per cent. of ATMs respectively. This compares favourably to other European hub
airports such as Amsterdam Schiphol (2013: Air France KLM, 58 per cent. of ATMs; SkyTeam, 64 per cent. of ATMs)
and Frankfurt (2013: Lufthansa, 66 per cent. of ATMs; Star Alliance, 78 per cent. of ATMs) (source: OAG, a provider
of global aviation information, data and insight (“OAG”)).

The chart below represents the total aeronautical income[(1)] for Heathrow airport by airline for 2013:

Source: Heathrow.

(1) Excludes other charges, related primarily to the provision of fixed electrical ground power and pre-conditioned air to aircraft.

**_Non-aeronautical income_**

Heathrow generates non-aeronautical income from a variety of sources. These include:

- concession fees from retail operators;

- direct income from car parks and advertising revenue;

- the rental of airport premises such as aircraft hangars, cargo storage facilities, maintenance facilities and offices;

- the provision of facilities such as baggage handling and passenger check-in; and

- fare revenue from the operation of the Heathrow Express rail service.


-----

**THE GROUP AND ITS OWNERSHIP**

The Group is indirectly owned by investment vehicles controlled or managed by Ferrovial S.A. (25.00%), Qatar
Holding LLC (20.00%), Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (13.29%), the Government of Singapore Investment
Corporation (11.88%), Alinda Capital Partners (11.18%), China Investment Corporation (10.00%) and Universities
Superannuation Scheme (8.65%). The Group companies are indirect subsidiaries of LHR Airports. LHR Airports is
itself a subsidiary of Heathrow Airport Holdings.

The Heathrow Airport Holdings Group currently owns and operates four airports in the United Kingdom. In addition to
Heathrow airport, it owns two airports in Scotland (Glasgow and Aberdeen) and Southampton airport. In August 2014,
Heathrow Airport Holdings announced that it had commenced a process that may lead to the sale of Glasgow, Aberdeen
and Southampton airports.


-----

**KEY STRENGTHS**

**Heathrow has a strong position in the South East of England, one of the world’s busiest air traffic markets and a**
**market with growing demand for air travel and limited airport capacity.**

- Airports are critical to domestic and international travel, trade and communication. London, as the world’s
leading financial and commercial centre, drives significant global business travel into and out of the region. In
2012, the United Kingdom was ranked eighth globally for international arrivals and eighth for international
tourism earnings (Source: Visit Britain).

- As London’s largest airport, and its only international hub, Heathrow airport is a critical infrastructure asset not
only for the UK but for global finance and commerce.

- Aviation has demonstrated resilience as a long-term growth industry. Over a period of 2003 to 2013, passenger
traffic through Heathrow increased at a compound annual rate of 1.4 per cent. despite the effects of the major
economic downturn in 2008 and 2009 (Source: Heathrow). Growth in air travel in the South East of England is
expected to continue. Total traffic through the five major airports in the Greater London area was approximately
138 million passengers in 2013 (Source: CAA). Heathrow accounted for approximately 52 per cent. of this
traffic (Source: CAA).

- The scale of infrastructure and geographical requirements necessary to develop a competing airport provide for
high barriers to entry. These barriers to entry are even more marked for hub airports such as Heathrow airport.

**Heathrow airport has a unique scale, market position and resilience in passenger traffic.**

- Heathrow airport is Europe’s busiest airport and the world’s third busiest in in terms of total passengers.

- Heathrow airport enjoys a unique market position in the United Kingdom, being the country’s only hub airport
and acting as the gateway to approximately 80 per cent. of all scheduled long-haul air traffic entering and leaving
the United Kingdom in 2013 (Source: CAA). In 2013, approximately 37 per cent. of its traffic comprised transfer
passengers with approximately 79 per cent. of this traffic connecting between international flights.

- Over half of Heathrow airport’s passengers are non-UK resident and it has an even split between business,
visiting friends and family and leisure traffic. Further, it has a balanced mix of European, North American and
other long haul traffic. As a result, there is a greater diversity of economic and demographic factors affecting the
airport’s passenger demand compared to other UK and international airports.

- A substantial proportion of Heathrow’s passenger traffic relates to long haul, which is the fastest growing
segment of the global aviation industry; at 52 per cent. in 2013, this is a significantly higher proportion than
other UK, European and US airports (Source: Heathrow). Heathrow airport has also been operating close to its
permitted capacity for a number of years reflecting airline demand to use the airport. These two factors provide
Heathrow airport with substantial resilience in its passenger traffic.

**Regulation provides cash flow visibility and mitigates market risk.**

- Heathrow is subject to price regulation by the CAA. This involves the CAA setting caps every five years on the
amount that Heathrow can charge airlines for using their facilities. The price caps are set taking into account
forecast passenger traffic, operating costs and other revenues for Heathrow as well as allowing recovery of
capital costs and a return on capital. In making its determination, the CAA takes into account the actual historic
experience of Heathrow which materially mitigates the market risk faced by Heathrow. This price setting
mechanism provides significant income predictability and cash flow visibility within each regulatory period as
well as protection against longer term cost and revenue risks.

**Proven resilience to shocks and economic downturns.**

- Heathrow airport has been resilient to economic downturns and other changes in the air travel market such as
wars, acts of terrorism and the threat of pandemic illnesses. In recent years, demand for air travel in the United
Kingdom has tended to return relatively quickly to historic levels following external shocks. The graph below
shows that demand shocks in the United Kingdom, such as the closure of UK airspace in 2010, the terrorist
attacks of 11 September 2001, oil crises in 1973 and 1979, the first Gulf war in 1990 and the global financial
crisis at its height in 2008 and 2009, have been followed by periods of renewed growth bringing passenger
numbers back to the pre-shock trend.

**Heathrow benefits from diversified income sources and serves a variety of market segments.**

Heathrow earns income from a variety of sources, including charges to airlines, concession fees from retail operators,
income from car parks, advertising revenue, the rental of airport premises such as aircraft hangars, cargo storage
facilities, maintenance facilities and offices, the provision of facilities such as baggage handling and passenger check-in
and revenues from Heathrow Express.

Heathrow airport serves a diversified range of major airlines. It is home to British Airways and Virgin Atlantic Airways
and also sizeable operations for many non-UK airlines, particularly from Europe, North America, the Middle East and
Asia. Heathrow airport’s main customer and airline alliance represent a smaller proportion of operations than other
European hub airports. Heathrow airport serves a range of market segments, including business and leisure travellers,
origin and destination and transfer passengers and long and short haul routes.

**STRATEGY**

Heathrow’s strategy is focused on developing the airport’s position as the UK’s direct connection to the world and
Europe’s hub airport of choice.

To support and develop Heathrow airport’s role as a hub, the Group will continue enabling the success of the major
network airlines operating at Heathrow by investing in further capacity, operational flexibility and resilience at
sustainable charges for airline customers.

Heathrow airport offers a compelling, competitive range of routes and frequencies for the large London origin and
destination aviation market. For both local and transfer passengers, Heathrow is working continuously to make every
journey better through improved service standards to ensure it remains passengers’ preferred airport. Improving the
passenger experience is supported by ongoing investment in modern airport facilities and operating processes.

**THE ROLE OF HEATHROW**

Heathrow co-ordinates the activities of the numerous organisations involved in the provision of airport services to
passengers, airlines and other airport users which include:

- providing passengers, airlines and other service providers with the infrastructure and facilities (such as check-in
desks, concourses, gate rooms, baggage handling facilities and office facilities) needed to optimise operations
and maximise passenger and flight traffic within existing capacity constraints;

implementing, under government supervision, air transport security measures, including passenger and baggage
inspections. The UK Government has the power to give any airport operator “such directions of a general
character as appear to the Secretary of State to be necessary or expedient in the interests of national security or of
relations with a country or territory outside the UK”;

- maintaining and developing airport infrastructure to meet evolving airline and passenger demands;

- ensuring that Heathrow airport is served by appropriate and adequate ground transport services;

- maximising capacity at Heathrow airport and setting airport capacity constraints in consultation with National
Air Traffic Services Limited (“NATS”), the airlines and Airport Co-ordination Limited (“ACL”), an
organisation owned and managed by several major UK airlines, which allocates take-off and landing slots; and

- assigning airlines to terminals in consultation with the airlines, ACL and NATS.

**HEATHROW AIRPORT’S INFRASTRUCTURE, FACILITIES AND ACCESS**

_Overview_

Heathrow airport commenced operations as London’s principal commercial airport in 1946. The airport’s first
permanent terminal opened in 1955 and the substantial growth in demand for air transport throughout the 1960s and
1970s saw much of the core infrastructure at Heathrow airport’s Central Terminal Area developed, including the
opening of what is now Terminal 3 in 1961 and Terminal 1 in 1968 and the construction of car parks, public transport
and other operational and administration facilities. Terminal 4 was added in 1986.

In 2008, Terminal 5 opened on the western side of the airport. The terminal provides passenger capacity for up to 30
million passengers per year. The terminal has transformed passenger experience and also operational performance. The
main building and its satellites are positioned perpendicular to the runways, to maximise the efficient use of land on the
airport, delivering operationally efficient taxiway and runway hold processes for the benefit of the whole campus. As
well as delivering passenger, airline and airport benefit in its own right, the additional terminal capacity created by
Terminal 5 provided the space to allow Heathrow to begin renovating and rebuilding its other terminals.

The first key phase in transforming Heathrow’s existing terminals was the construction of a new Terminal 2. The
original Terminal 2 was closed in late 2009 with demolition of the old terminal infrastructure enabling construction of
the new terminal to commence in mid-2010. In June 2014, the £2.5 billion investment was opened on time and on
budget and attained a high safety record during the construction phase.

The original Terminal 2, opened by Her Majesty the Queen in 1955, was Heathrow's first terminal and was designed to
deal with 1.2 million passengers a year. The new terminal has the capacity to cater for up to 20 million passengers a
year. Airlines and passengers benefit from a £2.5 billion investment in state of the art facilities that include main
terminal and satellite buildings, a multi-storey short-stay car park and an energy centre supporting the Terminal 2
campus and the wider airport. The terminal and satellite buildings include 24 aircraft stands of which 7 stands are
capable of handling the increasing number of A380 aircraft operating at Heathrow.

The terminal will be home to all 23 Star Alliance member airlines operating at Heathrow together with Aer Lingus,
Virgin Atlantic Little Red and germanwings. For the Star Alliance airlines it provides the opportunity to enhance
efficiencies through use of common facilities, processes and personnel. It also enhances the scope for closer commercial
co-operation between alliance members by, for example, capitalising on competitive minimum connection times to
attract greater volumes of transfer passengers. Both these features will further strengthen Heathrow’s competitive
position.

Heathrow’s terminal capacity is expected to increase to approximately 85 million passengers per year once Terminal 2
is fully operational and Terminal 1 operations are discontinued (the latter of which is expected by the end of 2015).

In parallel with the work on Heathrow’s terminals, significant investment continues in Heathrow’s baggage
infrastructure. The underground automated baggage system between Terminal 3 and Terminal 5 is now fully
operational, and delivery of the Terminal 3 integrated baggage system remains on track to start operation in 2015.


-----

_Runways_

Heathrow airport’s two parallel runways generally operate in “segregated mode”, with arriving aircraft allocated to one
runway and departing aircraft to the other. To mitigate noise impact to residents living below the approach and
departure routes, the allocation of runways to arriving and departing aircraft is normally swapped at around 3:00 p.m.
each day or as weather conditions necessitate.

The airport is permitted to schedule up to 480,000 air transport movements per year and in 2013 its runways operated
nearly 98 per cent. of their permitted capacity.

_Retail Facilities_

Heathrow has a total of approximately 53,000 square metres of retail space served by over 120 retail clients operating
almost 500 retail outlets. Terminal 5, with over 24,000 square metres of retail space, has significantly increased the
airport’s overall retail portfolio. Heathrow owns over 20,000 public car park spaces that are available to travellers and
the general public. All terminals at Heathrow airport are served by car rental operators. The terminals and their
approaches provide advertising space, which yields further income.

_Access to Heathrow airport_

Heathrow’s extensive ground transport links facilitate access to the airport for passengers, cargo transporters and airport
personnel:

- Heathrow is located just off the M4 motorway to London and the west of England and London’s orbital
motorway, the M25.

- Heathrow Express offers a frequent non-stop rail service to and from London Paddington Station. This service is
supplemented by the Heathrow Connect “stopping service”, which provides local access to the airport as well as
connections with train services on the main rail line between London and the west of England.

- Additional direct rail connections to Heathrow airport are expected in the future following the completion of the
cross London rail service Crossrail. In addition, the UK Government has confirmed its support for a rail link
between Heathrow airport and the west of England on the Great Western Main Line forecast for completion in
2021 and the proposed high speed rail link between London and Birmingham (with a connection to Heathrow
airport) that is currently scheduled to be operational by 2026.

- The London Underground Piccadilly Line has stations serving each of the terminals at Heathrow airport.

- Long distance coach services operated by National Express provide fast services from Heathrow airport to
various parts of the United Kingdom, including Victoria Coach Station in Central London. Many of the local bus
services in the nearby London suburbs also run to the airport.

_Future investment at Heathrow Airport_

The opening of Terminal 2 is the culmination of an £11 billion capital investment at Heathrow over the last decade that
has transformed Heathrow’s infrastructure and positioned it strongly to continue its role as a leading global hub airport
for the benefit of the whole of the UK in the coming decades. It is expected that by the end of 2014 around 70 per cent.
of passengers will be using new or recently constructed terminals and the remaining 30 per cent. of passengers will be
using extensively refurbished terminals. The investment programme is also facilitating the co-location of members of
each of the three main global airline alliances.

Investment in Heathrow’s baggage infrastructure, the largest integrated baggage system in the world, continues in 2014.
The underground automated baggage system between Terminal 3 and Terminal 5 is fully operational, with the ability to
move 3,000 bags per hour via individual bag carriers travelling up to 20 miles per hour. The Terminal 3 integrated
baggage system, housed in a separate building, remains on track to start operations in 2015. The baggage building is
now complete, systems are being tested and commissioned and operational trials have started.

Capital expenditure for the Q6 regulatory period from 1 April 2014 to 31 December 2018 is forecast to be at least £2.3
billion. The capital programme is materially lower than in the last two regulatory periods, and is primarily focused on
maintenance and compliance related projects, operational resilience and improving the passenger experience. The plan
includes refurbishment of tunnels to the Central Terminal Area, a £1 billion programme of asset management and
replacement projects and a £350 million project to implement latest generation hold baggage screening equipment.


-----

In line with the regulatory settlement, the capital programme for Q6 may increase to up to £3.3 billion, this is subject to
further scoping of the remaining individual projects through the regulatory period and corresponding approval of the
business cases.

**Compound Annual Growth Rate, 2003-2013 ........** **1.4** **0.3**

Source: Heathrow.

(1) Percentage growth on previous year is based on unrounded passenger and air transport movement numbers.

Over the period from 2003 to 2013, traffic at Heathrow airport increased 14% to 72.3 million passengers in 2013, an
annual compound rate of 1.4 per cent. Growth at the start of the period partially reflected recovery in passenger traffic
following the terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001. The increase in passenger traffic in 2004 also reflected a
return to growth in Far East traffic following the SARS outbreak in 2003. Between 2004 and 2007 traffic increased
marginally. In 2008 and 2009, there were modest declines in traffic as a result of the global financial crisis. In 2010,
reported traffic declined a further 0.2 per cent. due to disruption from a number of exceptional events including closure
of UK and European airspace in April due to ash from an Icelandic volcano. The impact of these events was estimated
at a loss of up to 2.4 million passengers, representing underlying traffic growth of 3.4 per cent. From 2010 onwards,
Heathrow has attained record annual traffic.

From 2004 onwards, but excluding reductions in 2009 and 2010, the airport has been operating close to its limit of
480,000 air transport movements per year. In 2013, Heathrow operated at close to 98 per cent. of this limit. As a result,
overall passenger growth at the airport has been driven by factors such as increased passenger numbers per aircraft,
including through higher load factors and the introduction of larger aircraft. In addition one off factors such as the
acquisition of bmi by International Airlines Group (parent company of British Airways) has driven traffic growth. bmi
previously accounted for 8.0 per cent. of Heathrow’s total air transport movements but only 4.4 per cent. of passengers.
British Airways has introduced larger aircraft to operate the slots and has operated with higher load factors, which
particularly underpinned the traffic growth in 2013.

Over the last ten years there has also been a significant shift in traffic mix with substantial growth in emerging market
long haul routes such as the Far East, Middle East and India as well as the mature North Atlantic market. Long haul
traffic has increased 33 per cent. from 28.1 million passengers in 2003 to 37.4 million passengers in 2013, with almost
four million additional North Atlantic passengers and over five million additional passengers on other long haul routes.
European and domestic UK traffic was virtually identical in terms of absolute passenger numbers at the beginning and
end of this period although its share of Heathrow’s total traffic declined from 56 per cent. of total traffic in 2003 to 48
per cent. in 2013.


-----

This shift in mix has been driven by a number of factors including the strong economic development of emerging
markets. North American traffic growth has been driven by three distinct factors since 2002, namely recovery from the
terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001, the first phase of Open Skies becoming effective from March 2008 and
the success of joint transatlantic services launched by British Airways and American Airlines from March 2011. The
relative underperformance of domestic and European traffic has reflected increased use of alternative transport on
domestic routes as well as other short haul routes such as Paris and Brussels (such as Eurostar train services); and
airlines rotating their scarce slots to the more lucrative long haul market.

Heathrow remained resilient through the global economic downturn with passenger traffic declining only 1.4 per cent.
to 66.9 million in 2008 and 1.5 per cent. to 65.9 million in 2009 with a cumulative reduction in rolling annual traffic
from peak to trough in this period of 3.4 per cent. This was amongst the most resilient performances of major airports in
Europe and North America, thought to be influenced by two factors discussed above namely operating at full capacity,
which implies a certain level of unfulfilled demand, and Heathrow’s high exposure to long haul traffic, the faster
growing segment of the global aviation market.

Growth has continued in 2014, and in the twelve months to August 2014 traffic has grown 2.1% to 73.1 million
passengers.

The largest airline customer at Heathrow airport is British Airways, which has its global hub there. British Airways is a
full-service airline operating a network of intercontinental, European and domestic services. British Airways operates to
all regions serving key global cities. British Airways together with its sister airline Iberia (both owned by International
Airlines Group (“IAG”)), are currently the sole airline occupants at Terminal 5. Heathrow has an agreed joint
framework with British Airways for future cooperation.

Virgin Atlantic Airways operates multi-class flights to long haul destinations from Heathrow’s Terminal 3 and UK
domestic services from Heathrow’s Terminal 2.

**_Air Service Agreements_**

The rights of airlines to operate at Heathrow airport can be subject to air service agreements between the UK
Government, the European Union and other countries. In April 2007, the European Community, its Member States and
the United States signed the first stage of an Open Skies Agreement, which came into effect on 30 March 2008 and
liberalised air services between the EU and the United States providing access to Heathrow airport for a greater number
of airlines.

**OTHER OPERATIONS**

**_Cargo and Mail Carriers_**

Heathrow airport handles cargo and mail traffic although this forms a small part of air transport movements. The bulk
of cargo and mail at the airport is carried in the cargo holds of passenger flights rather than by dedicated cargo flights.
In the year ended 31 December 2013, there were 2,387 all-cargo air transport movements at Heathrow airport (Source:
Heathrow).

Cargo and mail carriers are responsible for handling merchandise and packages at Heathrow airport, including delivery
to cargo warehouses, customs procedures and clearance, aircraft loading and unloading, sorting and transport to the
final destination.

Heathrow provides cargo sheds and other accommodation and facilities which are leased, or separately billed on a use
basis, to cargo-service providers.

**ROLE OF GOVERNMENT SERVICES AND AGENCIES IN AIRPORT OPERATIONS**

The UK Government is responsible for a number of essential services at Heathrow airport, which it discharges through
governmental and non-governmental agencies, notably:

- Security operations: The UK Government is responsible for setting aviation security regulations, issues
directions to airport operators, airlines and cargo operators and monitors compliance with these directions
through a programme of regular inspections and audits;

- Public order and policing services: Policing operations at Heathrow airport are the responsibility of the
Metropolitan Police Authority which is paid to provide these services. These public safety services should be
distinguished from security operations, which are designed to prevent illicit acts that risk endangering the
security of aircraft and passengers; and

- Border controls: The UK Home Office’s Border Force is responsible for the control of persons and goods.

Air traffic control, including aerodrome navigation services, are provided by NATS, a privately held entity which is
responsible for the arrival and departure of aircraft to and from the aircraft parking areas at Heathrow. NATS also
works closely with Heathrow and airlines in determining the declaration of scheduling capacity.

**SUPPLIERS**

The Heathrow Airport Holdings Group works with numerous external suppliers for the delivery of services relating to
the day-to-day operation of the airport, as well as for the construction of capital projects.

**Utilities**

The electrical power distribution infrastructure at Heathrow airport is owned, managed, maintained and developed by
UK Power Networks Services Limited under a contract that expires in 2083. Arrangements are in place with E.ON and
Gaz de France for the supply of electricity and gas, with Three Valleys Water for the supply of water and with Thames
Water for sewerage and trade effluent services.

**IT**

IT services for Heathrow airport have been outsourced to be managed by Capgemini UK plc under a five year contract
that commenced in 2011.

**Other services**

There are a large number of services required for the operation of Heathrow airport which are arranged on a separate
basis with external suppliers, including security screening, baggage and ground handling, terminal cleaning and
passenger transportation services.


-----

**COMPETITION**

Heathrow airport competes for transfer traffic with the other major European hub airports such as Paris Charles de
Gaulle, Amsterdam Schiphol, Frankfurt and Madrid Barajas. The airport also faces increasing competition for transfer
traffic from hub airports in the Middle East, such as Dubai and Doha.

To a more limited extent, there is some competition from London Gatwick Airport, London Stansted Airport, London
Luton Airport, London Southend Airport and London City Airport in the air travel market in the South East of England
and other forms of travel (including the Eurostar high-speed train service connecting London with Paris and Brussels).

**UK AIRPORT CAPACITY**

London is the largest air travel origin and destination market in the world, and Heathrow airport is the primary airport in
London and the UK’s only hub airport. The airport is capacity constrained to 480,000 permitted flight arrivals and
departures annually and operates the busiest two runways worldwide. In 2013 Heathrow operated at nearly 98 per cent.
of its maximum capacity. The capacity shortage has arisen principally due to a lack of consistent sustained government
support for capacity expansion. Whilst there has been some free capacity at other London airports for many years, this
has not been seen as a substitute for operating from Heathrow airport for network airlines given the importance of the
transfer traffic dynamic of a hub airport such as Heathrow in supporting these airlines' business models. As a result,
Heathrow airport continues to operate at capacity.

At the end of 2012 the UK Government established the Airports Commission, chaired by Sir Howard Davies. The
Commission was tasked with examining the requirement for additional airport capacity to maintain the UK’s position as
Europe’s most important aviation hub. On 17 July 2013, Heathrow submitted three third runway options for the
Airports Commission to consider.

On 17 December 2013, the Airports Commission published its interim report on the steps needed to maintain the UK’s
global hub status. The Airports Commission stated that there is a clear case for at least one net additional runway in
London and the South East by 2030 and shortlisted potential sites for further analysis and assessment: 1) a 3,500 metre
runway proposed by Heathrow to the north west of the airport; 2) a separate proposal by Heathrow Hub Limited to
lengthen Heathrow’s existing northern runway to 6,000 metres; and 3) a new runway at Gatwick airport south of the
existing runway. In addition, the Airports Commission recommended short-term actions to improve the use of existing
runway capacity in the next 5 years.

On 2 September 2014, the Airports Commission confirmed its decision to not add the proposal for a new hub airport in
the inner Thames estuary to the shortlist of options. The commission concluded that the substantial disadvantages of the
proposal collectively outweigh its potential benefits.

Heathrow’s north west third runway option would raise the capacity at Heathrow to 740,000 flights a year, from the
current limit of 480,000. It would cater for 130 million passengers annually compared to 80 million today, allowing the
UK to compete with international rivals and providing capacity for the foreseeable future and is designed to evolve to
four runways if required.

The north west runway option is to the west of the short third runway proposal under the 2003 Air Transport White
Paper. With a north west third runway there will be 15% fewer people within Heathrow’s noise footprint in 2030 than
today. This is due to its positioning further from London, quieter new generation aircraft and changes in operating
procedures. The option maintains the principle of runway alternation to provide periods of respite from noise for all
communities around Heathrow.

Heathrow worked with local authorities, communities and other stakeholders to refine the runway option, including
public consultation which took place through February and March. Heathrow’s refreshed proposal was submitted to the
Airports Commission in May 2014. This submission improves on the July 2013 submission with proposals for further
reduction of noise impact, improved road capacity, reduced congestion impacts and faster delivery of hub capacity at a
competitive world-class airport.

Construction of the new runway could be completed in six years with an estimated earliest operational date of 2025 at
an estimated cost of £16 billion. The proposal is based on private funding of the core airport infrastructure, investment
over approximately 15 years, on the basis of an appropriate regulatory regime in place to give long-term visibility of
returns to investors commensurate with risk. It is unlikely there would be material capital expenditure related to any
new runway at Heathrow during the current regulatory period ending on 31 December 2018.


-----

Heathrow will continue to engage the CAA, the Airports Commission and other stakeholders on the proposals. A public
consultation by the Airports Commission on evidence submitted is expected in the last quarter of 2014 and a report on
final findings is expected in summer 2015.

**ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION**

A wide variety of EU and UK environmental policies and regulations affect Heathrow, focusing in particular on noise;
air quality; energy use; soil and water pollution arising from airport operations; surface water drainage and flooding;
waste handling, management and disposal.

There are three main tiers of regulation which govern aircraft noise in the UK: international, European and national.

**International regulation**

The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is an inter-governmental organisation that aims to develop the
principles and techniques of international civil air navigation and foster the planning and development of international
air transport. Through its Noise Action Plan, Heathrow has adopted the ICAO’s balanced approach to aircraft noise
management. This consists of identifying the noise problem at an airport and then analysing the various measures
available to reduce noise through the exploration of four principal elements, namely; reduction at source (quieter
aircraft), land-use planning and management, noise abatement operational procedures and operating restrictions.

**European regulation**

The EU works to define the approach towards a common aviation policy in Europe. The main driving force for this has
been the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC), which has been set up under the auspices of the EU and ICAO.
The EU has issued various directives relating to the management and control of environmental issues and is
increasingly assuming responsibility for the regulation of aircraft noise standards. Member States are obliged to comply
with the requirements of the directives and incorporate them into national legislation.

**National regulation**

The UK Government has an important role in setting and developing the policy framework for aircraft noise control at
UK airports. A range of noise controls relating directly to aircraft operations are set out in statutory notices and are
published in the UK Aeronautical Information Package (“UK AIP”) and elsewhere as appropriate. These controls cover
aspects such as Continuous Descent Approaches (“CDAs”), noise abatement procedures and night flight restrictions.

As well as government legislation, additional noise-related controls are introduced by local planning authorities as part
of the planning system. This is often done by way of planning obligations contained in section 106 agreements made
between the airport operator and the planning authority. At Heathrow airport there are a series of planning conditions
that relate both to the planning permission for Terminal 4 and Terminal 5. These conditions restrict the operation of
aircraft at different times of the day relative to the location of the activity on the airfield.

The UK Government’s Air Quality Strategy implements the requirements of European legislation for air quality and
provides a framework to identify air quality improvement measures and sets out a coordinated approach to achieve
them. The local authority for Heathrow airport has declared an “air quality management area” to manage nitrogen
dioxide levels in the vicinity of the airport. Major boiler installations at Heathrow are regulated by the Environment
Agency under the Environmental Permitting Regulations, to limit emissions to air from the operation of these
installations

Heathrow is also subject to regulation of energy and related CO2 emissions. Heathrow is subject to the EU Emissions
Trading System (“EU ETS”) due to the size of combustion plant on site. The EU ETS requires allowances equivalent to
emissions from fossil fuel combustion on site to be surrendered on an annual basis. Phase 3 of the scheme started on 1
January 2013 and, in line with the overall goal of reducing emissions across the EU, results in reduced free allowances
being allocated, with an increasing requirement over the phase to purchase allowances by auction or reduce carbon
emissions. Additionally, under the Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme (“CRC”), Heathrow is
required to pay a fee to the UK Government for each tonne of carbon dioxide emitted from fixed asset energy use that is
not already covered by the EU ETS. Phase 2 of the CRC started on April 2014, and introduces a per annum increase in
the cost of allowances in line with RPI.

Heathrow has adopted a strategy to reduce emissions from energy use in airport buildings by 34 per cent. by 2020 from
1990 levels. Heathrow also has strategies in respect of water and land quality, waste and biodiversity.

**RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

Heathrow has entered and may from time to time in the future enter into transactions with certain affiliates of Heathrow
Airport Holdings and its shareholders. All such contracts are and will be negotiated on an arm’s-length basis.

**SHARED SERVICES**

Pursuant to a Shared Services Agreement, LHR Airports provides or procures third parties to provide certain central
support services to the Group to assist with the running and management of Heathrow airport and Heathrow Express.

**_Services provided by LHR Airports_**

The services provided by LHR Airports include IT, health and safety, security, research, airport planning and
marketing, finance, human resources, property management, regulatory services, corporate and public affairs and legal
support. From 1 January 2013 following the divestment of Gatwick Airport and in light of the (at that time) expected
divestment of Stansted Airport and to reflect more accurately the current organisation and economic reality, LHR
Airports sub-contracted the majority of these services to Heathrow. Additionally, pursuant to a separate agreement,
LHR Airports has sub-contracted certain of the cash management and accounting services to LHR Business Support
Centre Limited.

All of the staff working for Heathrow are employed and provided by LHR Airports, although Heathrow Express
employs its staff directly with the exception of a small number of senior management who are employed by LHR
Airports.

The terms on which services and staff are provided to the Group are set out in the Shared Services Agreement. There is
a similar agreement between LHR Airports and the other airports in the Heathrow Airport Holdings Group.

**_Fees payable to LHR Airports_**

Heathrow pays a fee to LHR Airports which comprises:

(a) the cost to LHR Airports of providing the services; and

(b) in respect of centralised airport services, administrative and business support services and corporate services, a
margin of 7.5 per cent.

The majority of costs for employees provided under the Shared Services Agreement are included in the charges for
airport services and capital project services, to which the margin does not apply. The margin payable to LHR Airports
in relation to services to the Group was £0.3 million in the 12 months ended 31 December 2013.

**_Termination of Shared Services Agreement_**

Subject to the prior written consent of the Borrower Security Trustee, the Operating Companies have the right to
terminate the Shared Services Agreement in the case of a breach by LHR Airports with a material adverse effect not
remedied within 30 days, certain insolvency related events in relation to LHR Airports or if it becomes illegal for either
LHR Airports or the Obligors to perform their obligations under the Shared Services Agreement.

LHR Airports may terminate the Shared Services Agreement only where:

(a) another suitable and properly resourced member of the Heathrow Airport Holdings Group (excluding any
members of the Group) is appointed to act as replacement Shared Services Provider on substantially the same
terms;

(b) a replacement Shared Services Provider is appointed with the consent of and approved by the Borrower
Security Trustee and, unless otherwise agreed as an Extraordinary Voting Matter, a Ratings Confirmation is
provided; or

(c) the Operating Companies fail to pay any amounts of £50,000 or more to LHR Airports under the Shared
Services Agreement, subject to a 30 Business Day grace period.


-----

The Shared Services Agreement will terminate in respect of an Operating Company which ceases to be controlled by
LHR Airports. Unless otherwise agreed, termination will take effect 6 months from the date that the Operating
Company ceases to be controlled by LHR Airports.

LHR Airports is entitled to pass pensions costs on to the Group. These relate principally to LHR Airports’ obligation to
fund the Heathrow Airport Holdings Group defined benefit pension scheme and are calculated on a basis linked to
pensionable payroll in respect of those employees that LHR Airports makes available to the Operating Companies
under the Shared Services Agreement. In certain circumstances, the obligation of the Operating Companies to meet
pension costs will survive termination of the agreement.

In the event of termination of the Shared Services Agreement, LHR Airports is required to use its reasonable
endeavours to facilitate the transfer of the terminated services to the Operating Companies (or to any replacement
servicer appointed by the Operating Companies) with a view to ensuring an orderly and efficient transfer with minimal
disruption to the ongoing business of the Operating Companies. The employment of relevant airport level staff is
expected to pass to the relevant Operating Company or to a replacement service provider.

**INSURANCE**

LHR Airports provides insurance and claims handling services to the Operating Companies. LHR Airports arranges
both annual and multi-year insurance programmes on a group-wide basis for the Heathrow Airport Holdings Group.
Heathrow Express has separate public liability insurance cover and Heathrow, through LHR Airports, has separate
policies to protect against specific risks.

The Heathrow Airport Holdings Group insurance programmes, which are required under the Common Terms
Agreement (“CTA”), include the following insurance cover:

- **_property damage and business interruption insurance and construction all-risks insurance which covers all_**
risks (including terrorism) of sudden accidental direct physical loss or destruction of, or damage to, insured
property and resultant loss of revenue and/or increased costs of maintaining normal business activities. There is
also a separate policy covering specified tenanted properties, which provides cover on the basis of individual
property sums insured;

- **_general liability insurance, including aviation liability, aviation war/terrorism, public/product liability; public_**
liability with respect to the Heathrow Express rail service; and construction third-party liability;

- **_third-party financial loss and professional indemnity insurance; and_**

- **_employers’ liability insurance._**

Insurance cover for the Group is provided by a combination of insurance market entities and captive insurance
companies owned by or affiliated with LHR Airports or its ultimate shareholders.

The financing agreements (within the CTA) require Heathrow Airport Holdings to effect and maintain insurance
policies in relation to liabilities, undertakings and assets in accordance with good industry insurance practice. Details of
these insurance policies are provided annually to an insurance adviser acting on behalf of certain secured creditors.

Some insurance cover for the Group is provided by Heathrow Airport Holdings own captive insurance company, LHR
Insurance Services Ltd (the “Captive”). The Captive enables the Heathrow Airport Holdings Group to access
reinsurance markets (including Pool Re for property terrorism risks), to leverage the Heathrow Airport Holdings
Group’s combined position on the conventional insurance market and to offer funding options for the Group’s selfinsured retention. The Captive underwrites some group-wide risks and also funds some of the Heathrow Airport
Holdings Group’s self-insured retention.

For more information on insurance, see “Risk Factors – Commercial Risks – The Group’s insurance coverage might not
_be adequate or available in all circumstances”._

**PENSIONS**

The Heathrow Airport Holdings Group operates a number of pension schemes for its employees. The main schemes,
which are operated by LHR Airports, the employing company within the Heathrow Airport Holdings Group and
sponsor of the related pension schemes, comprise a defined benefit pension scheme that closed to employees joining
LHR Airports after 15 June 2008 (the “Pension Scheme”) and a defined contribution pension scheme that employees
joining LHR Airports since 16 June 2008 are eligible to join. There is also a separate defined contribution pension
scheme for employees of Heathrow Express.

Under the terms of the Shared Services Agreement, Group companies make monthly cash payments into the Pension
Scheme determined by the latest agreement made with the trustees of the Pension Scheme. Employer contributions into
the defined contribution pension scheme are determined simply as a percentage of pensionable salary. Under the terms
of the Shared Services Agreement, Group companies are also liable to fund their share of any deficit in the Pension
Scheme, if requested by LHR Airports. The Pension Scheme also has a right to receive up to £284 million of the
proceeds of an enforcement of the security granted by the Senior Borrower Group, which right ranks pari passu with the
Class A bonds.

The Pension Scheme is administered by a board of trustees comprising three employee representatives, one pensioner
representative and four LHR Airports nominated trustees. In addition, the Law Debenture Trust Company provides an
independent trustee. As at 30 June 2014, the Pension Scheme had 4,644 current members, 8,619 pensioners (including
pensions paid to surviving partners and dependents) and 5,075 deferred pensioners.

The most recent triennial valuation of the Pension Scheme was undertaken by its trustee as at 30 September 2010 and
indicated a scheme deficit at that date of £275 million calculated using the trustees’ actuarial assumptions. As part of
the triennial valuation process, agreement was reached between LHR Airports and the Heathrow Airport Holdings
Group Pension Trustee that the level of employer contribution for three years from 1 January 2012 would initially be
£97 million per year, comprising £73 million relating to future service benefits and a £24 million contribution intended
to eliminate the Pension Scheme’s deficit by 31 December 2020. Contribution to future service benefits was reduced to
£63 million following the disposal of Edinburgh and Stansted airports. All but approximately £10 million of the annual
contribution is met by Heathrow.

Discussions are currently underway regarding the triennial valuation as at 30 September 2013 that is expected to result
in agreement by the end of 2014.

In any sale of a Group company, a payment can be made to the Pension Scheme in an amount not exceeding the amount
specified in the Shared Services Agreement in order to bring an end to the relevant company’s pension funding
obligations.

The cost to the Group of contributions to defined contribution pension schemes in 2013 was approximately £5 million.

**AIRPORT REGULATION**

**AIRPORT REGULATION GENERALLY**

**_Regulatory Framework_**
Heathrow is subject to economic regulation by the Civil Aviation Authority (“CAA”). The CAA is the independent
aviation regulator in the UK, responsible for economic regulation, airspace policy, safety and consumer protection.

As the economic regulator for UK airports, the CAA assesses the market power of airports and if an airport passes the
market power test(s) set out in the Civil Aviation Act 2012 (the “Civil Aviation Act”), the airport is regulated by
means of a licence. Heathrow has been determined, by the CAA, to hold significant market power and operates under a
licence granted by the CAA in February 2014. The licence includes a price cap on Heathrow’s airport charges.

The CAA sets the maximum level of airport charges for Heathrow, generally for five year periods, known as
Quinquennia. Heathrow’s current regulatory period is for four years and nine months from 1 April 2014 to 31
December 2018 in order to align Heathrow’s financial and regulatory years. A summary of the regulatory settlement for
the current regulatory period is set out in “Heathrow Price Regulation—Key Elements of the CAA’s Q6 Decision”
below.

Heathrow is regulated by means of a price control mechanism known as RPI +/- X, which incorporates an allowed
return on the Regulatory Asset Base (referred to as the RAB). This is consistent with the economic regulation of other
UK regulated industries (such as telecoms and the energy sector). This form of economic regulation is also sometimes
referred to as incentive regulation, in that Heathrow has an incentive to outperform the price control by means of
attracting more passengers, reducing operating costs, or delivering higher commercial revenues than forecast. If the
opposite is the case, then Heathrow has to absorb the cost. There is not a retrospective adjustment for shortfalls in lost
income or additional costs (except where Heathrow incurs additional security costs, above an established threshold,
when implementing new security directives imposed by the EU or the UK Government).

**_The CAA and its Statutory Powers and Objectives_**
The CAA is the independent aviation regulator in the UK, responsible for economic regulation, airspace policy, safety
and consumer protection.

The CAA has a single primary duty to further the interests of users of air transport services regarding the range,
availability, continuity, cost and quality of airport operation services (where appropriate, by promoting competition in
the provision of airport operation services). There are also supplementary duties to which the CAA must have regard:

## • the need to secure that each holder of a licence is able to finance its provision of airport operation services in the
area for which the licence is granted;

## • the need to secure that all reasonable demands for airport operation services are met;

 • the need to promote economy and efficiency on the part of each holder of a licence in its provision of airport
operation services;

## • the need to secure that each holder of a licence is able to take reasonable measures to reduce, control or mitigate
the adverse environmental effects of the airport to which the licence relates, facilities used or intended to be used
in connection with that airport (“associated facilities”) and aircraft using that airport;

## • any guidance issued to the CAA by the Secretary of State for Transport;

 • any international obligation of the United Kingdom notified to the CAA by the Secretary of State for Transport;
and

## • the principles that regulatory activities should be carried out in a way which is transparent, accountable,
proportionate and consistent, and that regulatory activities should be targeted only at cases in which action is
needed.

In its duties, the CAA also has to take account of the UK’s international obligations which provide, among other things,
that airport charges for non-national aircraft are not higher than those paid by national aircraft engaged in similar
operations.


-----

The International Civil Aviation Organisation publishes guidance on charges for airport services. It considers that where
an airport is provided for international use, the users shall ultimately bear their full and fair share of the cost of
providing the airport including a reasonable rate of return on assets. It also provides guidance on charging systems
suggesting, among other things, that charges should be simple and non-discriminatory and that increases should be
introduced on a gradual basis where possible.

**PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMIC REGULATION**

The Civil Aviation Act prohibits an operator of a dominant airport area from charging for airport operation services,
unless it has a licence granted by the CAA. An airport area is dominant if the CAA determines (and publishes) that the
Market Power Test (“MPT”) in the Civil Aviation Act is met by the relevant airport operator. The MPT has three parts:

## • whether the relevant operator has, or is likely to acquire, substantial market power in a market, either alone or
taken with such other persons as the CAA considers appropriate;

## • whether competition law does not provide sufficient protection against the risk that the relevant operator may
engage in conduct that amounts to an abuse of that substantial market power; and

## • for users of air transport services, the benefits of regulating the relevant operator by means of a licence are likely
to outweigh the adverse effects.

In January 2014, the CAA confirmed that the MPT was met in relation to the core area of Heathrow airport and that
Heathrow’s significant market power is likely to endure for the Q6 period.

**_The Price Cap_**
The price cap for Heathrow is based on a Regulatory Asset Base (“RAB”) methodology using a “single till” building
block approach. The single till takes into account revenue and costs from both aeronautical and non-aeronautical
activities when setting the price caps for a Quinquennium.

In setting the price cap, the CAA determines the regulated revenue requirement. This is calculated as the sum of
forecast operating expenditure less other revenue plus the required return (using the cost of capital determined by the
CAA) on the forecast RAB (taking into account forecast capital expenditure), plus regulatory depreciation and plus or
minus any profiling adjustment. The profiling adjustment is a mechanism used to smooth charges that might otherwise
occur as a result of major investments. The resulting regulated revenue requirement effectively amounts to the total
income from airport charges.

This methodology for deriving the regulated revenue requirement can be represented by a simplified diagram:

**Regulatory Building Blocks**

The regulated revenue requirement is divided by forecast passenger numbers which, subject to a price profiling
adjustment to smooth charges across the five years of a regulatory period, establishes the price cap expressed as a
maximum allowable yield per passenger.

Since the start of the current regulatory period, the maximum allowable yield changes from 1 January each year by RPI
+/- X per cent. based on RPI from the previous April.

In setting the price cap the CAA will take its own view of the scope for future efficiency savings, the appropriate level
of capital expenditure and the rate of growth in demand for airport services.

While the price cap places a limit on the increase in the airport charges yield, Heathrow has the discretion on whether to
price to the maximum permitted level. Therefore, Heathrow can choose to price charges below the cap. For example, if
there is unused capacity, Heathrow could choose to set prices below the cap in order to stimulate demand.


-----

The price control conditions set by the CAA include the following components for the maximum allowable yield:

- The “S factor” is mechanism designed to adjust the maximum allowable yield within the relevant
Quinquennium for either additional or reduced security costs incurred as a result of new UK or European
Commission security directives issued by or through the UK Government. For the current regulatory period, the
adjustment enables Heathrow to pass through 90 per cent. of any additional (or reduced) security costs around a
deadband of £19 million.

- The “K factor” is designed to correct for any under recovery (dilution) or over recovery (concentration) in
airport charges compared to the annual maximum allowable yield per passenger. Under or over recoveries
generally arise due to changes in traffic mix or average loads compared to those forecast at the time prices were
set for the relevant year. For example, an increase in long haul departing passengers would result in yield
concentration leading to an over recovery. Conversely, an increase in average load factors or the proportion of
transfer passengers would cause yield dilution. The K factor adjustment is applied to the maximum allowable
yield calculation two years after the year in which it is incurred and therefore can be carried forward to the
following Quinquennium.

- There is a capital expenditure “trigger” term built into the price control for Heathrow, with provision for the
maximum allowable yield to be reduced if specified project milestones are not delivered on time.

- There is a service quality rebate scheme at Heathrow which sets defined service standards for a range of services
and facilities. See “– Heathrow Price Regulation – SQR Scheme” below.

**_Regulatory Asset Base (RAB)_**
As with other regulated utilities in the UK, the RAB acts as a unit of regulatory value and does not correspond to
statutory asset values. The CAA has historically calculated a forecast of the value of the RAB for Heathrow over each
year of the Quinquennium. The closing RAB for Heathrow for each year is taken to be the sum of the opening RAB,
plus capital expenditure (unless disallowed by the CAA) plus an adjustment for RPI inflation less regulatory
depreciation (including the pricing profile adjustment—see “—The Price Cap” above) and less proceeds of any
disposals at the airport.

The CAA does not update the value of the RAB during each Quinquennium. Heathrow has been required to submit
regulatory accounts to the CAA at 31 March of each year (at 31 December from 2014 onwards), identifying, among
other things, the value of the RAB. A decision as to whether the current period RAB has been appropriately updated
during the current regulatory period is not made until the CAA sets the opening RAB for the next Quinquennium as part
of the price control review.

The RAB is independently verified by Heathrow’s statutory auditors and included in the regulatory accounts which are
provided annually to (but not approved by) the CAA.

**HEATHROW PRICE REGULATION**

**_Key Elements of the CAA’s Q6 Decision_**
The CAA’s decision in respect of Heathrow for Q6 was published on 10 January 2014 and subsequently set out in
Heathrow’s licence issued on 13 February 2014. The key elements of the CAA’s licence for the 4 years and 9 month
period covered by Q6 include:

- a continuation of the RAB-based construct using the single-till and incentive based regulation in the form of an
RPI based price cap;

- a maximum allowable yield based on RPI -1.5 per cent.;

- a WACC (weighted average cost of capital, which is the CAA’s assessment, using a notional capital structure, of
the allowed blended cost of debt and return on equity to satisfy the requirements of capital providers over the
Quinquennium) of 5.35 per cent. (pre-tax real);

## • assumed capital expenditure of £2.816 billion over Q6;

- projected operating costs of £4.731 billion, lower than had been forecast by Heathrow;

- a “write down” of £30 million to the RAB to reflect the CAA’s view of capital inefficiency on a specific project
undertaken during Q5;


-----

## • forecast aggregate passengers for Q6 of 347.7 million including an allowance for the impact of demand shocks
(other than macro-economic related impacts) in the derivation of the passenger forecast; and

## • a split between “core” and “development” capital expenditure for Q6 to allow for greater flexibility in the capital
planning process. Under this arrangement, designation of capital expenditure as core represents firm investment
commitments at the start of the Q6 price control where the scope and cost estimate was reasonably certain.
Designation of capital expenditure as development enables projects to be included over the Q6 price control
period that were not sufficiently scoped or costed at the start of Q6. The CAA set an initial capital expenditure
envelope for Q6 comprising a fixed allowance for core capital expenditure and an indicative allowance for
development capital.

**_SQR Scheme_**
Heathrow’s licence for Q6 includes a service quality rebate (“SQR”) scheme similar to the SQR scheme that applied
during Q5 with defined service targets for a range of services relating to passengers’ experience such as security
queuing times, departure lounge seat availability, cleanliness, way-finding, flight information, arrivals baggage reclaim
availability, the availability of equipment such as lifts, escalators and people movers and the availability of and access
to infrastructure such as piers, jetties and stands. The service standards cover other areas such as airfield congestion.

To the extent that Heathrow does not achieve the defined standards, rebates to airlines are required. The maximum total
revenue at risk during the Quinquennium is 7 per cent. of the total airport charges. Heathrow can achieve a 1.44 per
cent. revenue upside in the form of a bonus if it exceeds certain SQR targets.

As a proportion of total airport charges, rebates are up to a total of approximately 2.6 per cent. for departure lounge seat
availability, cleanliness, way-finding, flight information, arrivals baggage reclaim and equipment availability, 1.2 per
cent. for infrastructure availability and access, 1.1 per cent. for passenger security queuing times and 1.0 per cent. for
airfield congestion.

Over the six years of Q5 up to 31 March 2014, Heathrow incurred total rebates of £38 million (approximately 0.6 per
cent. of aeronautical income over the period).

**_Heathrow’s licence_**
Heathrow’s licence includes a self-modification provision allowing for Heathrow and airlines to agree immediate
changes to the SQR scheme and for the CAA to act as arbiter if the parties cannot reach agreement on the proposed
changes.

Heathrow’s licence for Q6 includes the price control and SQR conditions described above. Other key elements of the
licence include:

## • Revocation: Heathrow’s licence will remain in force in perpetuity except for certain limited circumstances in
which the licence may be revoked such as where the licence is no longer required or continued lack of
compliance by Heathrow in relation to regulatory requirements.

## • Financial resilience: the licence contains the following financial resilience conditions:

 – a restriction on business activities that prohibits Heathrow from undertaking unrelated business activities
and placing the regulated business at risk which reflects the Permitted Business restriction in the Common
Terms Agreement;

## – a requirement on the directors of Heathrow to provide an annual certificate on the adequacy of resources
to continue to provide airport operation services at Heathrow airport for the following 2 years;

## – an undertaking from FGP Topco Limited, Heathrow’ ultimate holding company, not to do anything that
would put Heathrow in breach of its licence;

## – a requirement for Heathrow to put in place a continuity of service plan;

 – a requirement for Heathrow to provide prior written notice to the CAA if it intends to amend its financing
arrangements in respect of credit rating requirements; and

## – an obligation on Heathrow to notify the CAA in the event of Heathrow (or any company within its group
where the financial position of that company or its inability to continue to trade would have an adverse
effect on Heathrow’s financial position or ability to continue to trade) seeking advice from an insolvency
practitioner or any other person relating to Heathrow’s financial position or ability to continue to trade.


-----

## • operational resilience: The licence includes a condition relating to the need to secure the availability and
continuity of airport operation services, particularly in times of disruption.

## • procurement: The licence includes a condition requiring Heathrow to ensure its procurement of capital projects is
efficient and economical, and that it must publish its policies and procedures on how it will achieve this.

## • planning and delivery of capital projects: The CAA noted in its notice granting the licence in February 2014 that
it has identified a possible need for a new licence condition. The new licence condition, relating to the planning
and delivery of capital projects possibly putting greater accountability on Heathrow to ensure efficient delivery
and engagement with the airline community, is to be developed when the licence is in place. Heathrow is now
taking work forward to give effect to the licence including, for example, the protocol in respect of capital
projects. To date, the CAA has not initiated work on a possible new licence condition.

**AERODROME LICENCES**

Heathrow is subject to aerodrome licensing, which requires the operator to demonstrate that it is competent to conduct
aerodrome operations safely.

The CAA must grant a licence in respect of any aerodrome in the United Kingdom if it is satisfied that:

- the applicant is competent, having regard to its previous conduct and experience, equipment, organisation,
staffing, maintenance and other arrangements, to secure that the aerodrome and the airspace within which its
visual traffic pattern is normally contained are safe for use by aircraft; and

- the aerodrome is safe for use by aircraft, having regard in particular to the physical characteristics of the
aerodrome and of its surroundings.

Heathrow has an aerodrome licence for Heathrow airport.

From April 2014 the existing aerodrome licensing regime has begun to be replaced by a certificate, issued under the
European Aviation Safety Agency’s (“EASA”) regulations. There will be a 4 year transition period (ending 31
December 2017) in order to allow airports to convert their existing licences to the new EASA certificate. The CAA will
still be the primary regulatory point of contact for Heathrow airport. It will remain the CAA’s responsibility to conduct
inspections of the airport in its capacity as the national aviation authority. However, EASA will conduct audits of the
CAA (and all other national aviation authorities) to ensure standardisation across member states.

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

**£325 MILLION NOTES DUE 2017 AND £275 MILLION NOTES DUE 2019**

On 9 November 2010 the Issuer issued £325 million 7.125 per cent. Senior Secured Notes due 2017 (the “2017 Notes”).
Subsequently, on 14 December 2012, the Issuer issued £275 million 5.375 per cent. Senior Secured Notes due 2019 (the
“2019 Notes”). The 2017 Notes and 2019 Notes are governed by terms and conditions which are identical in all
material respects to the terms and conditions of the Notes except as to interest, maturity, the definition of Permitted
Holders and the Group RAR financial covenant. The 2017 Notes and 2019 Notes are secured by fixed and floating
security over substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and of Heathrow (DSH) Limited (including the issued share
capital of the Issuer and Security Parent) as described below under “—Security”.

**ISSUER FACILITIES**
The Issuer currently has in place two loan facilities, an £85 million facility repayable by 22 May 2016 and a £77.5
million facility repayable by 19 December 2019 (the “Issuer Facilities”). The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and
Deutsche Trustee Company Limited act as agent and as security agent respectively in relation to the Issuer Facilities.

The Issuer Facilities are secured by fixed and floating security over substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and of
Heathrow (DSH) Limited (including the issued share capital of the Issuer and Security Parent) as described below under
“—Security”.

**Repayments and Prepayments**
Subject to certain conditions, the Issuer may voluntarily prepay and/or permanently cancel all or part (being a minimum
amount of £10,000,000) of the loans or available commitments (as appropriate) under the Issuer Facilities by giving
three business days' prior notice to the agent. Amounts prepaid may not be reborrowed.

In addition to voluntary prepayments, the Issuer Facilities require mandatory cancellation and, if applicable, prepayment
(or, as the case may be, an offer to do so) in full or in part in certain circumstances, including:

- with respect to any lender, if it is or will become unlawful for such lender to perform any of its obligations under
the Issuer Facilities; and

- upon the occurrence of a sale of the whole or substantially all of the Group's business and assets.

Upon a change of control, the Issuer must notify the agent of such change of control. If there is a change of control,
each lender may elect to cancel its commitments immediately and declare all amounts owing to it under the Issuer
Facilities due and payable immediately.

**Interest and Commitment Fees**
Loans under the Issuer Facilities bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus the applicable margin and any
mandatory cost.

The applicable margin for the facility repayable by 22 May 2016 is 4.25 per cent. per annum and for the facility
repayable by 19 December 2019 is 5.75 per cent. per annum.

**Security**
Both the Issuer and Heathrow (DSH) Limited have entered into debentures granting fixed and floating security over
substantially all of their assets and undertaking (including, without limitation, a first ranking charge of all the issued
share capital of Security Parent and the Issuer, respectively) to secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Issuer
Facilities. The holders of the Notes, the holders of the 2017 Notes, the holders of the 2019 Notes and any hedge
counterparties also benefit from this security package as will any additional third party creditor which becomes a
Secured Party in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. The security securing the Issuer Facilities
rank and secure the Issuer Facilities, the Notes, the 2017 Notes, the 2019 Notes, any other Bond Liabilities, any other
Credit Facilities Liabilities and any Hedging Liabilities (as those terms are defined in “Terms and Conditions of the
_Notes”) pari passu pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (see “—Intercreditor Agreement”)._


-----

**Representations**
The Issuer Facilities include standard representations and warranties, which include, amongst others, valid power and
authority to enter into the agreement, compliance with applicable laws, no misleading information and that the Issuer
has good title to its assets.

**Financial Covenants**
In addition to the general covenants described below, the Issuer Facilities each contain a financial covenant requiring
the Group to maintain (i) a Group RAR (as defined in “Terms and Conditions of the Notes”) not greater than either 90
per cent. in respect of each 31 December after the Issuer Facilities were entered into; and (ii) a Group ICR (as defined in
“Terms and Conditions of the Notes”) not less than 1.0 in respect of each period of 12 months ended 31 December after
the Issuer Facilities were entered into. The Issuer will be able to cure any breaches of these financial covenants up to
twice (in non-consecutive years) during the life of each of the Issuer Facilities.

**General Covenants**
The Issuer Facilities contain positive and negative covenants. The restrictions on investments, negative pledge,
disposals, affiliate transactions, indebtedness, dividends and share capital (save for certain agreed deviations) follow the
relevant provisions of the Notes, as described in more detail in “Terms and Conditions of the Notes”.

**Events of Default**
In addition, the Issuer Facilities provide events of default, including, among others, the following:

- non payment, subject to a 3 business day grace period for administrative and technical errors;

- breach of financial covenants with no grace period;

- breach of other obligations, subject to a 20 business day grace period;

- misrepresentation, subject to a 20 business day grace period;

- cross default;

- insolvency, insolvency proceedings and creditor process, subject (where relevant) to a 28 day grace period;

- unlawfulness and invalidity;

- cessation of business;

- termination of licence;

- audit qualification;

- repudiation and rescission of agreement; and

- litigation and creditor's process.

Upon the occurrence of an event of default under either of the Issuer Facilities, the relevant agent may, among other
things, declare all of the loans and all other amounts payable thereunder to be immediately due and payable or to be
payable on demand.

**INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT**

**General**
The Issuer and Heathrow (DSH) Limited have entered into an intercreditor agreement (the “Intercreditor
**Agreement”) with, among others, the security agent, the agent under the Issuer Facilities, the trustee for the 2017**
Notes, the trustee for the 2019 Notes and any hedging creditors. The Trustee will accede to the Intercreditor Agreement
on or about the issue date of the Notes.

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the term “Secured Parties” is defined to mean the security agent, the agent,
arrangers and lenders under the Issuer Facilities, the Trustee in its capacity as trustee for the holders of the Notes, the
holders of the 2017 Notes and the holders of the 2019 Notes, any hedging creditor, any future secured creditor which
has acceded as a party to the Intercreditor Agreement in the relevant capacity and any receiver or delegate appointed by
the security agent pursuant to any of the security documents.

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law.

The Intercreditor Agreement includes terms that establish:

- the ranking and priority of the liabilities owed to the lenders under the Issuer Facilities, to the Trustee in its
capacity as the trustee for the holders of the Notes, the holders of the 2017 Notes and the holders of the 2019


-----

Notes, to the hedging creditors and to Heathrow (DSH) Limited with respect to liabilities owed by the Issuer to
Heathrow (DSH) Limited (“Parent Liabilities”);

- the basis on which the security agent is appointed to hold the collateral created by the security documents;

- under what circumstances the security documents may be enforced;

- the application of proceeds from an enforcement in respect of the collateral; and

- under which circumstances the collateral may be shared on a pari passu basis with additional third party
creditors.

**Priority of Secured Obligations**
The Intercreditor Agreement purports to rank (in right and priority of payment) the debt held by the Secured Parties
under the Issuer Facilities, the trust deed for the 2017 Notes, the trust deed for the 2019 Notes, the Trust Deed and the
hedging agreements (the “Secured Obligations”), together with the collateral that secures such Secured Obligations,
_pari passu without any preference between any such class of Secured Obligations._

**Incremental and Refinancing Debt**
The Intercreditor Agreement permits certain additional secured debt, including any debt which is raised pursuant to
additional credit facilities and additional bonds or notes issued by the Issuer and which are permitted under the terms of
the Issuer Facilities, the trust deed for the 2017 Notes, the trust deed for the 2019 Notes and the Trust Deed to share in
the collateral and rank pari passu alongside the other Secured Obligations.

**Prohibited Actions**
The Intercreditor Agreement does not limit the making of:

- payments, distributions or other actions in respect of the Secured Obligations under the Issuer Facilities;

- payments (including in respect of scheduled interest and principal) in respect of the Secured Obligations under
the Trust Deed; and

- payments in respect of the Secured Obligations under the hedging agreements (subject to certain restrictions as
set out in the Intercreditor Agreement),

in each case, in accordance with terms of the documents governing the relevant class of Secured Obligations.

Following the occurrence of certain acceleration and/or insolvency events all payments in respect of Secured
Obligations must be applied in accordance with the payment waterfall set out in the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement prohibits Parent Liabilities from receiving the benefit of any security, guarantee,
indemnity or other assurance against loss and, prior to the final discharge of all obligations under the Secured
Obligations or an insolvency event, prohibits the taking of any enforcement action by the Parent with respect to Parent
Liabilities.

**Enforcement of Security Documents**
The Intercreditor Agreement provides that only the security agent will have the right to enforce the security documents.

Under the Intercreditor Agreement and subject to the security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms,
the security agent shall determine the nature, management, timing and control of any enforcement of the security
documents on the instructions of the Secured Parties who, in the aggregate, hold more than 50 per cent. of the amounts
under the Issuer Facilities (and certain additional credit facilities), any hedging arrangements and the Notes then
outstanding (including certain additional notes) (the “Majority Primary Creditors”). In the absence of such
instructions, the security agent shall act as it sees fit.

The security agent will not be liable in any respect to any Secured Party or any other person for exercising (or failing to
exercise) any of its rights, powers or discretions in relation to the security documents. The security agent may disregard
any instructions to enforce any security if those instructions are inconsistent with the Intercreditor Agreement.

**Snooze/Lose**
The Intercreditor Agreement provides that if in relation to a request for a consent to participate in a vote or to approve
any other action or provide any confirmation or notification under the Intercreditor Agreement, the agent under the
Issuer Facilities, the Trustee (in its capacity as trustee for the holders of the Notes, the holders of the 2017 Notes or the
holders of the 2019 Notes) or a hedge counterparty (each, for itself and on behalf of the creditors it represents) fails to
respond to that request within 20 business days of the request being made, the consent or vote of such party (and the
aggregate principal amount of indebtedness represented by such party) shall be disregarded for the purposes of
ascertaining whether an agreement has been obtained, a vote carried or another action approved, and, in the case of any
confirmation or notification, that confirmation or notification will be deemed to have been given.


-----

**Enforcement Proceeds**
The Intercreditor Agreement regulates the order in which amounts received by the security agent (including upon
enforcement of the collateral) are distributed to the Secured Parties.

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the parties agree that, following any enforcement of the security documents, the
claims of the security agent, any receiver or delegate appointed by the security agent pursuant to any of the security
documents will have first ranking claims (without any priority between themselves), followed by the costs and expenses
of any Secured Party (including the Trustee and the agents) incurred in realisation or enforcement of the security
documents, and then followed by claims in respect of the obligations under the Issuer Facilities, the obligations under
the trust deed for the 2017 Notes, the obligations under the trust deed for the 2019 Notes, the Trust Deed, the
obligations of any hedging creditor and the obligations under any other additional bonds or additional credit facilities
permitted under the Trust Deed and the Intercreditor Agreement ranking pari passu and pro rata according to the
respective amounts among themselves, and finally followed by any claim which the security agent is obliged to pay in
priority to the Issuer or Heathrow (DSH) Limited. The balance (if any) will be paid to the Issuer and Heathrow (DSH)
Limited. The security agent will apply amounts received following enforcement, including recoveries from
enforcement, in accordance with this priority.

The Intercreditor Agreement contains customary turnover provisions.

**Appointment of Security Agent**
The Intercreditor Agreement sets out the terms on which the security agent holds the benefit of the security documents.

The security agent shall not be obliged to take any action (including with respect to taking enforcement proceedings or
enforcing the security documents) unless indemnified, secured or prepaid to its satisfaction. The security agent shall be
entitled to accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of banking or other business with
either the Issuer or Heathrow (DSH) Limited.

Unless acting on the instruction of the Majority Primary Creditors, or exercising certain specific discretions granted to it
under the Intercreditor Agreement, in exercising any discretion to exercise a right, power or authority under the
Intercreditor Agreement, the security agent shall do so having regard to the interests of all the Secured Parties.

The security agent is not obliged to insure any collateral, or require any other person to maintain such insurance, and
will not be responsible for any loss, expense or liability which may be suffered as a result of the lack of, or inadequacy
of, such insurance. Each Secured Party (other than the security agent) is responsible for undertaking its own
independent appraisal and investigation of all risks arising under or in connection with the Intercreditor Agreement and
related documents, including in respect of the financial condition, status and nature of each member of the Group and
the title of any security provider to the collateral. Neither the security agent nor any receiver or delegate shall be liable
for (among other things) validity, effectiveness, adequacy or enforceability of the collateral.

**Release of Transaction Security**
The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the security agent may release the collateral (and the obligations of the
obligors) under certain conditions, including in connection with the enforcement of the security documents or in
connection with the sale or disposal of assets permitted by each relevant financing document.

**Common Security**
None of the lenders under the Issuer Facilities, the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes and the 2017 Notes or
the hedging creditors may take the benefit of any security or guarantees in respect of their respective Secured
Obligations other than under the relevant financing documents and the security documents.

**Amendments**
The security agent, the Issuer and Heathrow (DSH) Limited each has the right to make amendments which are minor or
of a technical nature to the Intercreditor Agreement without any further consent from the Secured Parties. Other
amendments or waivers of the Intercreditor Agreement may be made only with the consent of the agent under each
Issuer Facility, the Trustee as representative of the holders of the Notes, the 2017 Notes and the 2019 Notes, the trustee
or agent under any additional bonds or additional credit facilities permitted by the Trust Deed and the Intercreditor
Agreement, the security agent and Heathrow (DSH) Limited, except that any amendment, waiver or consent that only
affects the rights and obligations of certain parties (and which could not reasonably be expected to be adverse to the
interests of the other parties) requires the consent only of the parties so affected. Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the
security agent may—if so instructed by the Majority Primary Creditors, and if Heathrow (DSH) Limited consents—
amend the terms of, waive requirements of or grant consents under any of the relevant security documents, provided
that for releases of security, claims or liabilities or any consents given by the security agent in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, any amendment, waiver or consent related to the security documents which affects the nature
or scope of the security or the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the security are distributed requires the
prior consent of the Secured Parties.

**SENIOR BORROWER GROUP INDEBTEDNESS**
As at 30 June 2014, the Senior Borrower Group had indebtedness totalling £11,858 million under revolving credit
facilities (the “RCF”), a revolving working capital facility, a liquidity facility (the “Senior Borrower Liquidity
**Facility”), term loans from the European Investment Bank (together, the “Authorised Senior Credit Facilities” and**
each an “Authorised Senior Credit Facility”) and borrower loan agreements between Heathrow and Heathrow
Funding Limited, which correspond in their terms to each series of bonds (the “Senior Bonds”) issued by Heathrow
Funding Limited (the “Borrower Loan Agreements” and, together with the Authorised Senior Credit Facilities, the
“Senior Borrower Group Indebtedness”). The Senior Borrower Group can issue senior ranking debt (“Senior Debt”)
and junior ranking debt (“Junior Debt”).

The Senior Borrower Group Indebtedness is secured by substantially all the assets of each of the members of the Senior
Borrower Group (the “Senior Obligors” and each a “Senior Obligor”) and guarantees by each Senior Obligor in
respect of each other's obligations, in favour of the lenders under the Senior Borrower Group Indebtedness (the “Senior
**Borrower Secured Creditors”). In addition, Heathrow Funding Limited as issuer of the Senior Bonds provided**
security over substantially all of its assets in favour of the trustee under the Senior Bonds and holders of the Senior
Bonds.

A common terms agreement (the “CTA”) sets out the common warranties, covenants, trigger events or loan events of
default applicable to the Senior Borrower Group Indebtedness. The Senior Borrower Secured Creditors have also
entered into intercreditor arrangements, contained in a security trust and intercreditor deed (the “STID”). These are
described below.

If the Senior Borrower Group fails to make payments or comply with the covenants in respect of its financing, this may
result in a default under the Senior Borrower Group financing and the insolvency of the Senior Borrower Group. The
Notes will be subordinated to all liabilities of the Senior Borrower Group and so in such circumstances the Issuer's
ability to make payments under the Notes would be severely restricted and there might be no returns in relation to the
Notes.

**CTA**

**_General_**
The CTA sets out certain representations, covenants, Trigger Events and Loan Events of Default which apply to each
Authorised Senior Credit Facility including the Borrower Loan Agreements. A copy of the CTA is available on the
Heathrow Airport Holdings Group's website and is incorporated by reference in this Prospectus.

**_Covenants_**
The covenants are positive, negative, informational and financial in nature. They include an undertaking by LHR
Airports Limited as the agent of the Senior Borrower Group (the “Senior Borrower Group Agent”) to provide
consolidated audited financial statements of the Senior Borrower Group and Heathrow Funding Limited for each
financial year and consolidated, unaudited financial information for the financial half-year.

The Senior Borrower Group Agent must also supply an Investor Report by 30 June and 31 December each year which
includes a general update on the Senior Borrower Group, regulatory and business developments and capital expenditure.

Each Senior Obligor has undertaken not to incur any Financial Indebtedness other than Permitted Financial
Indebtedness. The incurrence of additional Senior Debt or Junior Debt is subject to certain conditions including that the
Senior RAR, the ratio of Senior Debt to the total RAB must be less than 0.725 and the Junior RAR, the ratio of Junior
Debt to the total RAB must be less than 0.90, in each case calculated taking account of the proposed additional
Financial Indebtedness. In addition, there are provisions which restrict the amount of Financial Indebtedness which can
fall due (a) within any 24-month period to 30 per cent. of total RAB and (b) within any Five-Year Period to 50 per cent.
of total RAB.

Heathrow cannot be sold without approval from the requisite majority of qualifying Senior Borrower Secured Creditors.
In addition to the restrictions on financial indebtedness and disposals, the CTA also contains a number of covenants
which regulate the Senior Obligors' activities including, among others:

(1) limitations on non-permitted business;

(2) limitations on joint ventures;

(3) a negative pledge; and

(4) a requirement to comply with specified insurance and outsourcing policies.

**_Trigger Events_**
The CTA sets out certain trigger events including:


-----

(1) any breach of the following financial ratios:

(A) the Senior RAR as at any Relevant Date prior to 1 April 2018 is, or is estimated to be, more than 0.70 and
thereafter is, or is estimated to be, more than 0.725;

(B) the Junior RAR as at any Relevant Date is, or is estimated to be, more than 0.85;

(C) the Senior ICR for each Relevant Period is, or is estimated to be, less than 1.40; or

(D) the Junior ICR for each Relevant Period is, or is estimated to be, less than 1.20;

(2) credit rating downgrades on the Senior Bonds;

(4) the commencement of the final reading of draft legislation in the House of Lords or the House of Commons
(whichever occurs later) relating to the business of any Senior Obligor if such legislation could (if enacted)
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

(5) forecast Capital Expenditure over the 12 month period following a Calculation Date exceeds the aggregate of
undrawn RCF, cash and Projected Excess Cashflow Before Capex over such 12 month period;

(6) the amount available under the Issuer Liquidity Facilities/any cash liquidity reserve is less than the estimated
interest and equivalent finance charges for (a) the 12 month period following a Calculation Date in respect of
Issuer Senior Debt and (b) the six-month period following a Calculation Date in respect of Issuer Junior Debt;

(7) the issue of any compliance or enforcement order by any Regulator which would reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect; or

(8) the issue of a termination notice or a notice of any proposed or actual modification in respect of any licence by a
Regulator which, if implemented, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

The occurrence of a Trigger Event gives rise to various consequences including a block on Restricted Payments, the
preparation of remedial plans and a termination plan in respect of the Shared Services Agreement, and a right for the
security trustee under the Senior Borrower Group Indebtedness to request to participate in discussions with the
Regulator.

**_Loan Events of Default_**
The CTA contains a number of Loan Events of Default (subject, in some cases, to agreed exceptions, materiality
qualifications, reservations of law and grace periods) including:

(1) non-payment by a Senior Obligor of amounts payable under the Finance Documents;

(2) a breach of the following financial ratios:

(A) if the Senior RAR as stated in the compliance certificate produced in respect of the reporting date falling
in June in respect of 31 December of the preceding financial year is more than 0.925; and/or

(B) if the Average Senior ICR as stated in the compliance certificate produced in respect of the reporting date
falling in June is less than 1.05;

(3) non-compliance with any term of any covenant or undertaking in any Finance Document;

(4) a representation made or repeated by a Senior Obligor in any Finance Document being incorrect or misleading in
any material respect when made or deemed to be repeated;

(5) the insolvency of a Senior Obligor;

(6) it becoming unlawful for any Senior Obligor to perform its obligations under any transaction document;

(7) certain changes in law; or

(8) the occurrence of an event of default under the Senior Bonds.

In respect of each Loan Event of Default requiring any action or discretion on the part of the relevant creditor, the
security trustee under the Senior Borrower Group Indebtedness will act in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the STID.

**_Hedging Policy_**
The Senior Borrowers are subject to a Hedging Policy which is set out at Schedule 5 of the CTA. The Senior Borrowers
have entered into and in the future may enter into various interest rate, inflation-linked and currency hedging
transactions in conformity with the Hedging Policy.


-----

**Security Trust And Intercreditor Deed ( STID )**
The intercreditor arrangements among the Senior Borrower Secured Creditors of the Senior Borrower Group (the
“Senior Intercreditor Arrangements”) are contained in the STID. Creditors of debt not secured by the collateral
securing the liabilities under the CTA are not and will not become parties to the Senior Intercreditor Arrangements and
will not be subject to their terms. However, the aggregate amount of such Financial Indebtedness is restricted under the
CTA.

The purpose of the Senior Intercreditor Arrangements is to regulate, among other things: (i) the claims of the Senior
Borrower Secured Creditors and their ranking in point of payment after the delivery of a Loan Enforcement Notice; (ii)
the exercise, acceleration and enforcement of rights by the Senior Borrower Secured Creditors; (iii) the rights of the
Senior Borrower Secured Creditors to instruct the security trustee under the Senior Borrower Group Indebtedness; and
(iv) the giving of consents and waivers and the making of modifications to the CTA, the Security Documents, the
Shared Services Agreement, the STID, the Master Definitions Agreement and the Tax Deed of Covenant (the
“Common Documents”). The Senior Intercreditor Arrangements provide for the subordination and postponement of all
claims in respect of Financial Indebtedness of any Heathrow Airport Holdings Group company or Affiliate thereof that
is not a member of the Senior Borrower Group and following delivery of a Loan Acceleration Notice, payments under
the Shared Services Agreement and certain other contracts otherwise entered into in accordance with the CTA.

As regards the giving of consents and waivers and the making of modifications in relation to the Common Documents,
the STID contains provisions which enable the security trustee under the Senior Borrower Group Indebtedness to give
or permit the making thereof in certain circumstances (principally where it determines that the consent, waiver or
modification will not be materially prejudicial to Senior Borrower Secured Creditors). Where the security trustee under
the Senior Borrower Group Indebtedness is not willing or able to exercise its discretion, approval from relevant
qualifying Senior Borrower Secured Creditors is required. Consents, waivers or modifications may, depending on their
nature, constitute Ordinary Voting Matters or Extraordinary Voting Matters. In addition, they may constitute an
Entrenched Right in respect of one or more Senior Borrower Secured Creditors, with the result that the consent of such
Senior Borrower Secured Creditors will need to be obtained. Voting is effected on a “one pound equals one vote” basis,
except that, in the case of bank debt, the entirety of the relevant outstanding bank debt will vote in accordance with the
instructions given by the relevant majority of the bank lenders in respect of such debt.

There are also provisions which enable instructions to be given to the security trustee under the Senior Borrower Group
Indebtedness by the required percentage of Qualifying Senior Borrower Secured Creditors in relation to a number of
matters, including whether to enforce the security following a Loan Event of Default and whether to deliver a Loan
Acceleration Notice.

With exceptions, the Senior Borrowers are generally free to pay debts as they fall due, whether they be in respect of
Senior Debt or Junior Debt, or in respect of unsecured claims. There are, however, priorities of payments which
regulate payments made after the delivery of a Loan Enforcement Notice and after the delivery of a Loan Acceleration
Notice. In addition, the making of certain payments following a Loan Event of Default is regulated.

**TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE NOTES IN DEFINITIVE FORM**

_Some of the definitions in the terms and conditions of the Notes refer to definitions in the Common Terms Agreement_
_and the Master Definitions Agreement (each as defined below). The Common Terms Agreement and the Master_

_Issues) and forming a single series with the Notes) of Heathrow Finance plc (the “Issuer”) are constituted by a Trust_
Deed dated 16 October 2014 (the “Trust Deed”) made between the Issuer, Heathrow (DSH) Limited (the “Parent”)

The issue of the Notes was authorised by resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Issuer passed on 30 September
2014. The statements in these Conditions include summaries of, and are subject to, the detailed provisions of and
definitions in the Trust Deed. Copies of the Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement dated 16 October 2014 (the “Agency

Agreement, the “Paying Agents”, which expression shall include the Principal Paying Agent) and the Trustee, the
Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below), the Common Terms Agreement (as defined below) and the Master

and the Couponholders at the principal office of the Principal Paying Agent, being at the time of issue of the Notes at

Agents. The Noteholders and the Couponholders are entitled to the benefit of, are bound by, and are deemed to have
notice of, all the provisions of the Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement applicable to
them.

Terms used in these Conditions but not defined in the Condition in which they first appear shall have the meanings
attributed to them in Condition 21 (Definitions), unless otherwise stated.

**1.** **FORM, DENOMINATION AND TITLE**

(a) The Notes are in bearer form, serially numbered, in the denominations of £100,000 and integral multiples of
£1,000 in excess thereof, up to and including £199,000, each with Coupons attached on issue. Notes of one
denomination may not be exchanged for Notes of any other denomination.

(b) Title to the Notes and to the Coupons will pass by delivery.

(c) The Issuer, any Paying Agent and the Trustee may (to the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws) deem and
treat the bearer of any Note and the bearer of any Coupon as the absolute owner for all purposes (whether or not
the Note or Coupon shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing on the Note or
Coupon or any notice of previous loss or theft of the Note or Coupon or of any trust or interest therein) and shall
not be required to obtain any proof thereof or as to the identity of such bearer.

**2.** **STATUS**

The Notes and the Coupons constitute direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and secured obligations of the Issuer and
shall at all times rank pari passu and without any preference among themselves.

**3.** **SECURITY**

(a) _Security. Under the Transaction Security Documents, the Transaction Security has been granted by the Parent_
and the Issuer to secure the payment when due of the Issuer's payment obligations under the Notes and the Trust
Deed. On the date of the Trust Deed, the Transaction Security consists of (a) on a first-priority basis, charges
over all of the share capital of the Issuer held by the Parent and the Issuer's holding of shares in the share capital
of Heathrow (SP) Limited, and (b) on a first-priority basis, charges over substantially all the other tangible and
intangible assets of the Parent and the Issuer.

The Transaction Security securing the Notes ranks and secures the Notes, any other Bond Liabilities, the Credit
Facilities Liabilities and the Hedging Liabilities pari passu pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.


-----

Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and compliance with these Conditions, including compliance
with Conditions 4.6 (Negative Pledge) and 4.9 (Further Assurances) and the provisions of the Trust Deed, the
Issuer is permitted to extend the benefit of the Transaction Security to holders of certain future Financial
Indebtedness that may be incurred, including any Additional Notes permitted under these Conditions and the
Trust Deed.

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides, amongst other things, that any proceeds received from enforcement
of the Transaction Security will be shared equally and rateably in satisfaction of the Credit Facilities Liabilities,
the Hedging Liabilities and the Bond Liabilities.

Each Noteholder, by subscribing to, purchasing or otherwise acquiring a Note, shall be deemed (i) to have
authorised the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into the Transaction Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) to be bound thereby.

Noteholders may not, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favour
under the Transaction Security Documents. The Noteholders may only act through the Trustee or the Security
Agent, as applicable. Subject to Conditions 12 (Enforcement of Security) and 13 (Noteholder Action) and the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will agree to any release of the security interests
created by the Transaction Security Documents that is in accordance with these Conditions and the Trust Deed
without requiring any consent of the Noteholders. The Trustee has the ability to direct the Security Agent to
commence enforcement action under the Transaction Security Documents, subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement. The enforcement of the Transaction Security provided for under the Transaction
Security Documents is subject to the Intercreditor Agreement.

Subject to the terms of the Transaction Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Issuer is
entitled (without consent of the Trustee or the Noteholders) to exercise any and all voting rights and to receive
and retain any and all cash dividends, share dividends, liquidating dividends, non-cash dividends, shares
resulting from share splits or reclassifications, rights issue, warrants, options and other distributions (whether
similar or dissimilar to the foregoing) in respect of the shares that are part of the Transaction Security.

The rights under the Transaction Security Documents with respect to the Notes and the Trust Deed must be
exercised by the Security Agent in respect of all of the Notes outstanding and in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

(b) _Release of the Transaction Security. All Security granted to the Security Agent on behalf of the Noteholders and_
the Trustee under the Transaction Security Documents will be automatically and unconditionally released if all
obligations under these Conditions and the Trust Deed are discharged, in each case in accordance with the terms
and conditions in the Trust Deed and the Intercreditor Agreement.

**5.** **THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT**

(a) The Trustee has acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement with, amongst others, the agent under the Facility
Agreements and the Security Agent. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Transaction Security
securing the Notes will rank and secure any other Bond Liabilities, the Credit Facilities Liabilities and the
Hedging Liabilities pari passu. The Intercreditor Agreement also provides, amongst other things, that any
proceeds received from enforcement of the Transaction Security Documents will be shared equally and rateably
between the Credit Facilities Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities and the Bond Liabilities.

(b) Each Noteholder, by subscribing to, purchasing or otherwise acquiring a Note, will be deemed to have:

payment of interest thereafter, in respect of each Interest Period from and including 1 March 2015 to but

of interest, to be made on 3 March 2025, will be in respect of the period from and including 1 September 2024 to
but excluding 3 March 2025 and will amount to £29.07 per principal amount of £1,000 per Note. Each Note will
cease to bear interest from, and including, its due date for redemption unless, upon due presentation, payment of
the principal in respect of the Note is improperly withheld or refused or unless default is otherwise made in
respect of payment in which event interest shall continue to accrue as provided in the Trust Deed.

(b) Where interest is required to be calculated (or paid in respect of overdue principal and other overdue amounts) in
respect of a period that is shorter than an Interest Period, the day count shall be computed on the basis of a 360day year of 12 months.

**7.** **REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE**

7.1 _Final Redemption_

Unless previously redeemed, or purchased and cancelled, the Notes will be redeemed at their principal amount on the
Maturity Date.

7.2 _Optional Redemption_

(a) **_Optional Redemption. At any time, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice (which notice shall be_**
irrevocable), the Issuer may redeem all or some only of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100 per cent. of
the principal amount thereof plus the Applicable Redemption Premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
to but excluding the redemption date.

The Issuer will publish a notice of any optional redemption of the Notes under this Condition in accordance with
the provisions of Condition 20 (Notices).

If fewer than all the Notes are to be redeemed at any time pursuant to this paragraph (a) the Issuer will select the
Notes by a method that complies with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which the
Notes are listed at such time or, if the Notes are not listed on a securities exchange, by such method as the
Trustee in its sole discretion shall deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no such partial redemption
shall reduce the portion of the principal amount of a Note not redeemed to less than £100,000. The Trustee shall
not be liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

(b) **_Redemption Upon Changes in Withholding Taxes. The Notes may be redeemed at their principal amount,_**
together with interest accrued to but excluding the date of redemption at the option of the Issuer in whole, but not
in part, at any time, on giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice to the Noteholders in accordance
with Condition 20 (Notices) (which notice shall be irrevocable), if the Issuer satisfies the Trustee immediately
prior to giving such notice that:

(i) it has or will on the occasion of the next payment due in respect of the Notes become obliged to pay
Additional Amounts as provided or referred to in Condition 10 (Taxation) as a result of any change in, or
amendment to, the laws or regulations of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, or any change in the published
application or official interpretation of such laws or regulations, which change or amendment becomes
effective on or after the date of the Trust Deed; and

(ii) such obligation cannot be avoided by the Issuer taking reasonable measures available to it, provided that
no such notice of redemption shall be given earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the
Issuer would be obliged to pay such Additional Amounts were a payment in respect of the Notes then
due.

Prior to the publication of any notice of redemption pursuant to this paragraph (b):


-----

(A) the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee an opinion of independent legal advisers of recognised standing to
the effect that the Issuer has or will become obliged to pay such Additional Amounts as a result of such
change or amendment; and

(B) the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that the obligation referred to in
clause (b)(i) above cannot be avoided by the Issuer taking reasonable measures available to it,

and the Trustee shall be entitled to accept such opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the condition
precedent set out in clause (b)(i) above, and such certificate as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the
condition precedent set out in clause (b)(ii) above and such opinion and certificate (if accepted) shall be
conclusive and binding on the Noteholders and the Couponholders.

7.3 _Purchase of Notes Upon a Change of Control_

(a) If a Change of Control occurs at any time, then the Issuer must make an offer (a “Change of Control Offer”) to
each Noteholder to purchase such holder's Notes, at a purchase price (the “Change of Control Purchase Price”)
in cash in an amount equal to 101 per cent. of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to the date of purchase described in paragraph (b) below (the “Change of Control Purchase Date”).

(b) Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will publish a notice of the Change of Control Offer
in accordance with Condition 20 (Notices) (the date of publication of such notice being the “Publication Date”),
specifying the nature of the Change of Control and the procedure for exercising the option contained in this
Condition 7.3, including (i) the Change of Control Purchase Price and (ii) the Change of Control Purchase Date,
which will be a Business Day no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the Publication Date, or such
later date as is necessary to comply with requirements under any applicable securities laws or regulations.

To exercise the option to require purchase of a Note under this Condition, a Noteholder must deliver such Note,
on any banking business day in the place of delivery prior to the Change of Control Purchase Date (the “Put
**Period”) at the specified office of any Paying Agent, accompanied by a duly signed and completed notice of**
exercise in the form (for the time being current) obtainable from the specified office of any Paying Agent (a “Put
**Notice”) and in which the Noteholder may specify a bank account complying with the requirements of Condition**
8 (Payments) to which payment is to be made under this Condition. Notes should be delivered together with all
Coupons appertaining thereto maturing after the date (the “Put Date”), which is seven days after the expiration
of the Put Period, failing which deduction in respect of such missing unmatured Coupons shall be made in
accordance with Condition 8 (Payments) and any amount so deducted will be reimbursed in the manner specified
in Condition 8 (Payments). The Paying Agent to which such Note and Put Notice are delivered will issue to the
Noteholder concerned a non-transferable receipt in respect of the Note so delivered. If the Put Date is an Interest
Payment Date, payment of the accrued interest in respect of any Note so delivered will be made in the manner
provided in Condition 8 (Payments) against presentation and surrender of the relevant Coupon. If the Put Date is
not an Interest Payment Date, payment of the accrued interest, and in all cases, payment of principal in respect of
any Note so delivered will be made, if the Noteholder duly specified a bank account in the Put Notice to which
payment is to be made, on the Put Date by transfer to that bank account and in every other case on or after the
Put Date against presentation and surrender or (as the case may be) endorsement of such receipt at the specified
office of any Paying Agent in accordance with Condition 8 (Payments). A Put Notice, once given, shall be
irrevocable. For all relevant purposes of these Conditions, receipts issued pursuant to this Condition shall be
treated as if they were Notes. The Issuer shall purchase (or procure the purchase of) the relevant Notes on the Put
Date unless previously redeemed or purchased and cancelled.

(c) The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if a third party makes the Change of Control
Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in these Conditions
applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and offers to purchase all Notes validly tendered and
not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. The Change of Control provisions of this Condition will be
applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Trust Deed are applicable.

(d) To the extent the Issuer complies with applicable tender offer rules and any other applicable securities laws and
regulations and such rules, laws and regulations conflict with provisions of this Condition 7.3, the Issuer will not
be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Condition and the Trust Deed by virtue of such conflict.

7.4 _Sinking Fund; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases; Cancellation of Notes_

(a) The Issuer is not required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the
Notes.

(b) The Issuer and any of its Subsidiaries may at any time purchase Notes in the open market or otherwise at any
price (provided that they are purchased together with all unmatured Coupons relating to them).

(c) All Notes so redeemed or purchased and any unmatured Coupons attached to or surrendered with them may, but
need not, be cancelled at the election of the Issuer. Any Notes or Coupons so cancelled will not be re-issued or
resold.


-----

(d) Where Notes redeemed pursuant to this Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase) are cancelled upon redemption,
any unmatured Coupons appertaining to such Notes, whether or not attached thereto or surrendered therewith,
shall also be cancelled and may not be resold or re-issued.

**8.** **PAYMENTS**

(a) Payments of principal and premium (if any) and payments of interest due on each Interest Payment Date will be
made against presentation and surrender (or, in the case of a partial payment, endorsement) of Notes or the
appropriate Coupons (as the case may be) at the specified office of any Paying Agent by Sterling cheque drawn
on, or by transfer to a Sterling account maintained by the payee with, a bank in London. Payments of interest due
in respect of any Note other than on an Interest Payment Date shall be made only against presentation and either
surrender or endorsement (as appropriate) of the relevant Note.

(b) All payments are subject in all cases to any applicable fiscal or other laws and regulations, but without prejudice
to the provisions of Condition 10 (Taxation). No commissions or expenses shall be charged to the Noteholders or
Couponholders in respect of such payments.

(c) Each Note should be presented for payment together with all unmatured Coupons relating to it, failing which the
full amount of any such missing unmatured Coupon (or, in the case of payment not being made in full, that
proportion of the full amount of such missing unmatured Coupon which the amount so paid bears to the total
amount due) will be deducted from the amount due for payment. Each amount so deducted will be paid in the
manner mentioned above against presentation and surrender (or, in the case of part payment only, endorsement)
of such missing Coupon at any time before the expiry of ten years after the relevant payment date in respect of
the relevant Note (whether or not the Coupon would otherwise have become void pursuant to Condition 9
(Prescription)) or, if later, five years after the date on which the Coupon would have become due, but not
thereafter.

(d) A Note or Coupon may only be presented for payment on a day which is a banking business day in the relevant
place of presentation (and, in the case of payment by transfer to a Sterling account, in London). No further
interest or other payment will be made as a consequence of the day on which the relevant Note or Coupon may
be presented for payment under this paragraph (d) falling after the due date.

(e) The initial Paying Agent and its initial specified offices are listed below. The Issuer reserves the right, subject to
the prior written approval of the Trustee, at any time to vary or terminate the appointment of any Paying Agent
and to appoint additional or other Paying Agents; provided that they will at all times maintain:

(i) a Principal Paying Agent;

(ii) a Paying Agent with a specified office in a European Union member state (a “Member State”) that will
not be obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any
directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of 26-27 November 2000 or any
law of the European Union or a non-member state implementing or complying with, or introduced in
order to conform to, such directive; and

(iii) so long as the Notes are listed on any stock exchange or admitted to listing by any other relevant
authority, a Paying Agent with a specified office in such place as may be required by the rules and
regulations of the relevant stock exchange or such other relevant authority.

The initial specified office of the initial Paying Agent is:

Winchester House, 1 Great Winchester Street, London EC2N 2DB.

Notice of any change in the Paying Agents or their specified offices will promptly be given to the Noteholders
by the Issuer in accordance with Condition 20 (Notices).

In acting under the Agency Agreement, the Paying Agents act solely as agents of the Issuer and, in certain
limited circumstances specified therein, of the Trustee and do not assume any obligation to, or relationship of
agency or trust with, the Noteholders or the Couponholders. The Agency Agreement contains provisions
permitting any entity into which any Paying Agent is merged or converted or with which it is consolidated or to
which it transfers all or substantially all of its assets to become the successor paying agent.

**9.** **PRESCRIPTION**

(a) Claims in respect of principal and premium will become void unless the relevant Notes are presented for
payment within a period of ten years from the appropriate payment date.

(b) Claims for interest in respect of Notes shall become void unless the relevant Coupons are presented for payment
within five years of the relevant Interest Payment Date, subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) of Condition 8
(Payments).


-----

**10.** **TAXATION**

All payments by or on behalf of the Issuer under or with respect to the Notes will be made free and clear of and without
withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future Tax imposed or levied on such payments by or
within the United Kingdom or by or within any department, political subdivision or governmental authority of or in the
United Kingdom having power to tax (each, a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), unless the Issuer is required to
withhold or deduct Taxes by law. In that event, the Issuer will pay additional amounts (“Additional Amounts”) as may
be necessary to ensure that the net amount received by each Noteholder and Couponholder after such withholding or
deduction (including any withholding or deduction in respect of any Additional Amounts) will not be less than the
amount the Noteholder or Couponholder, as the case may be, would have received if such Taxes had not been withheld
or deducted.

The Issuer will not, however, pay Additional Amounts in respect of any Note or Coupon:

(a) held by or on behalf of a holder who is liable to such Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or levied by a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction by reason of the holder's present or former connection with such Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (other than the mere receipt, ownership, holding or disposition of Notes or Coupons, or by reason of
the receipt of any payments in respect of any Note or Coupon, or the exercise or enforcement of rights under any
Notes or Coupons);

(b) held by or on behalf of a holder who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting
any form or certificate, or by making a declaration of non-residence or other claim for exemption to the relevant
tax authority;

(c) presented for payment by or on behalf of a person who would have been able to avoid such withholding or
deduction by presenting the relevant Notes or Coupons, as the case may be, to another Paying Agent in a
member state of the European Union;

(d) presented for payment more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available to the Noteholder or
Couponholder (except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note
been presented on the last day of such 30-day period); or

(e) where such withholding or deduction is imposed on a payment to or for an individual and is required to be made
pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any directive implementing the conclusions of the
ECOFIN Council meeting of 26-27 November 2000 or any law of the European Union or a non-member state
implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such directive.

The Issuer will (i) make such withholding or deduction as is required by applicable law and (ii) remit the full amount
deducted or withheld to the relevant authority in accordance with applicable law.

Any reference in these Conditions to any amounts in respect of the Notes shall be deemed also to refer to any
Additional Amounts which may be payable under this Condition or under any undertakings given in addition to, or in
substitution for, this Condition pursuant to the Trust Deed.

If the Issuer becomes subject at any time to any taxing jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom, references in these
Conditions, in respect of payments by the Issuer to the United Kingdom shall be construed as references to the United
Kingdom and/or such other jurisdiction.

(i) default for 30 days in the payment when due of any interest or any Additional Amounts on any Note;

(vi) any Financial Indebtedness of any member of the Group:

(A) is not paid when due nor within any originally applicable grace period other than a non-payment of
interest in respect of Junior Debt; or


-----

(B) is declared to be or otherwise becomes due and payable prior to its specified maturity as a result of
an event of default (however described).

No Event of Default will occur under clause (A) or (B) above in respect of Financial Indebtedness if the
aggregate amount of all Financial Indebtedness falling within clauses (A) and (B) above is less than
£50,000,000 (or its equivalent in any other currency or currencies);

(vii) the Transaction Security ceases to be legal, valid, binding, enforceable or effective for any reason other

compulsory manager or other similar officer in respect of the Issuer or a Subsidiary Group
Company or any of their respective material assets,

or, in the opinion of the Trustee, any analogous procedure or step is taken in any jurisdiction; provided,
_however, that this clause (a)(x) shall not apply to: (X) any winding-up petition which is frivolous or_
vexatious and is discharged, stayed or dismissed within 28 days of commencement or, if earlier, the date
on which it is advertised; or (Y) an application for the appointment of a receiver, administrative receiver,
administrator, compulsory manager or other similar officer that is discharged at least five days prior to the
first hearing of that application.

(b) If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, and, in the case of the Events of Default described under clause

premium, if any, and any Additional Amounts and accrued interest on all the outstanding Notes
immediately due and payable. The ability of the Trustee and the Noteholders to declare, and of the

**12.** **ENFORCEMENT OF SECURITY**

(a) At any time after a Note Acceleration Notice has been given to the Issuer, the Trustee:


-----

(i) may in its absolute discretion; and

(ii) shall if it has been directed to do so:

(A) in writing by the holders of not less than 25 per cent. in aggregate of the principal amount of the
Notes outstanding; or

(B) by an Extraordinary Resolution of the holders of the Notes,

subject in each case to being indemnified and/or pre-funded and/or secured to its satisfaction in
accordance with the Trust Deed, instruct the Security Agent to make a Request for voting in relation to
enforcing the Transaction Security pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (each, a “Request
**Instruction”).**

(b) The Trustee shall, subject to being indemnified and/or pre-funded and/or secured to its satisfaction in accordance
with the Trust Deed, promptly after receiving any Request in relation to enforcement of the Transaction Security,
give a notice to Noteholders in accordance with Condition 20 (Notices) soliciting the direction from holders of
the Notes then outstanding (each, a “Noteholder Direction”) to the Trustee as to whether to instruct the Security
Agent to take enforcement action in relation to the Transaction Security pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement
(such instruction, an “Enforcement Instruction”). Upon the conclusion of the solicitation of Noteholder
Directions, the Trustee shall inform the Issuer and the Security Agent promptly in writing of the aggregate
principal amount of Notes represented by the holders of Notes voting in favour of the Enforcement Instruction, if
any.

(c) Any enforcement of the Transaction Security will be undertaken by the Security Agent, subject to, and in

undertakings or assets of the Issuer.

failure is continuing, the holders of not less than 25 per cent. in aggregate of the principal amount of the Notes
outstanding may, as applicable, sign and give a Note Acceleration Notice to the Issuer in accordance with
Condition 11 (Events of Default).

(c) If the Trustee having become bound to give a Request Instruction to the Security Agent fails to do so and that
failure is continuing, the holders of not less than 25 per cent. in aggregate of the principal amount of the Notes
outstanding may, as applicable, give a Request Instruction in writing directly to the Security Agent.

(d) If the Trustee having become bound to inform the Issuer and the Security Agent of the aggregate principal
amount of Notes represented by the holders of Notes voting in favour of the Enforcement Instruction fails to do
so and that failure is continuing, the Noteholders may provide their Noteholder Direction in writing in relation to
the taking of enforcement action in relation to the Transaction Security pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement
directly to the Security Agent.


-----

**14.** **SUBSTITUTION**

The Trustee may, without the consent of the Noteholders or Couponholders, agree with the Issuer to the substitution in

Coupons and the Trust Deed, of any Subsidiary of the Issuer, any successor in business of the Issuer or any Holding
Company of the Issuer, as more fully set forth in the Trust Deed, subject to (i) the Trustee being satisfied that the
interests of the Noteholders will not be materially prejudiced by the substitution, and (ii) certain other conditions set out
in the Trust Deed being complied with. As more fully set forth in the Trust Deed (and subject to the conditions and
qualifications therein), the Trustee may, without the consent of the Noteholders, also agree with the Issuer as to the
substitution of another corporation in place of the Issuer as principal debtor under the Notes, the Coupons and the Trust
Deed.

**15.** **REPLACEMENT OF NOTES AND COUPONS**

If any Note or Coupon is lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed it may be replaced at the specified office of the
Principal Paying Agent in London, subject to all applicable laws and stock exchange requirements, upon payment by
the claimant of the expenses incurred in connection with such replacement and on such terms as to evidence, security,
indemnity and otherwise as the Issuer may require (provided that the requirement is reasonable in the light of prevailing
market practice). Mutilated or defaced Notes or Coupons must be surrendered before replacements will be issued.

**16.** **MEETINGS OF NOTEHOLDERS, MODIFICATION, WAIVER AND AUTHORISATION**

(a) The Trust Deed contains provisions for convening meetings of the Noteholders to consider any matter affecting
their interests, including the modification by Extraordinary Resolution of any of these Conditions or any of the
provisions of the Trust Deed, the Notes, the Coupons, the Agency Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or the
Transaction Security Documents. Such a meeting may be convened by the Issuer or the Trustee and shall be
convened by the Issuer at the request of Noteholders holding not less than ten per cent. in principal amount of the
Notes for the time being remaining outstanding. The quorum at any meeting for passing an Extraordinary
Resolution will be one or more persons present holding or representing a clear majority in principal amount of
the Notes for the time being outstanding, or at any adjourned meeting one or more persons present whatever the
principal amount of the Notes held or represented by him or them, except that at any meeting, the business of
which includes the modification of certain of these Conditions and certain of the provisions of the Trust Deed,
the necessary quorum for passing an Extraordinary Resolution will be one or more persons present holding or
representing not less than two-thirds, or at any adjourned such meeting not less than one-third, of the principal
amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding. The matters (the “Basic Terms Modifications”) that require
such a quorum are:

(i) changing any date fixed for payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest in respect of the Notes,
reducing or cancelling the amount of principal, premium (if any) or interest payable on any date in respect
of the Notes, altering the method of calculating the amount of any payment in respect of the Notes on
redemption, maturity or following the occurrence of a Change of Control or altering the method of
calculating the date for any such payment;

(ii) alteration of the currency in which payments under the Notes and Coupons are to be made;

(iii) impairing the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or after the stated maturity
thereof (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the redemption date);

(iv) except as provided under Condition 4.6 (Negative Pledge), Condition 5 (The Intercreditor Agreement) or
paragraph (c) of this Condition, make any change to any Intercreditor Agreement (or any amended
Intercreditor Agreement or replacement thereof) or any provisions of the Trust Deed affecting the ranking
of the Notes and the ranking of the payment obligations under the Notes, in each case in a manner that
adversely affects the rights of the Noteholders or directly or indirectly releases the Transaction Security
under the Transaction Security Documents, except as permitted by these Conditions, the Trust Deed, any
Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction Security Documents;

(v) alteration of the quorum or majority required to pass an Extraordinary Resolution; and

(vi) alteration of (A) the definition of “Basic Terms Modifications” or (B) the quorum requirements for any
meeting convened to vote on any Basic Terms Modifications.

An Extraordinary Resolution passed at any meeting of the Noteholders will be binding on all Noteholders,
whether or not they are present at the meeting, and on all Couponholders.

The Trust Deed provides that (i) a resolution passed at a meeting duly convened and held in accordance with the
Trust Deed by a majority consisting of not less than three quarters of the votes cast on such a resolution, (ii) a
resolution in writing signed by or on behalf of the holders of not less than three-quarters in principal amount of
the Notes for the time being outstanding or (iii) consents given by way of electronic consents through the
relevant clearing system(s) (in a form satisfactory to the Trustee) by or on behalf of the holder(s) of not less than


-----

three quarters in principal amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding, shall, in each case, be effective as
an Extraordinary Resolution. Such a resolution in writing may be contained in one document or several
documents in the same form, each signed by or on behalf of one or more Noteholders.

(b) The Trustee may (in the case of paragraphs (i)(A), (i)(B) and (ii)) and shall (in the case of paragraph (i)(C))
agree, without the consent of the Noteholders or Couponholders:

(i) (A) to any modification of, or to the waiver or authorisation of any breach or proposed breach of, any
of these Conditions or any of the provisions of the Trust Deed, the Notes, the Coupons, the
Agency Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Transaction Security Documents (save to
the extent such modification, waiver or authorisation relates to any Basic Terms Modification)
which is not, in the opinion of the Trustee, materially prejudicial to the interests of the
Noteholders; or

(B) to any modification which is of a formal, minor or technical nature or to correct a manifest error or
an error which, in the opinion of the Trustee, is proven; or

(C) to any modification which is requested by the Issuer in order to allow the Issuer to comply with
any requirements which apply to it under EMIR subject to the Trustee receiving a certificate from
the Issuer certifying to the Trustee that the amendments are to be made solely for the purpose of
enabling the Issuer to satisfy its requirements under EMIR, unless the Trustee is of the opinion that
such modification would have the effect of exposing the Trustee to any liability against which it
has not been indemnified and/or secured and/or pre-funded to its satisfaction or the effect of
increasing the obligations or duties or decreasing the protections of the Trustee in any of these
Conditions or any of the provisions of the Trust Deed, the Notes, the Coupons, the Agency
Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Transaction Security Documents; or

(ii) to determine that any Event of Default or Default shall not be treated as such, subject to instructions to the
contrary from the Noteholders in the form of an Extraordinary Resolution (as further provided in the
Trust Deed).

(c) The Trust Deed also provides that at the request and expense of the Issuer and without the consent of the
Noteholders:

(i) at the time of, or prior to, the incurrence of any Financial Indebtedness that is permitted to share the
Transaction Security, the Issuer, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into an additional
intercreditor agreement on terms substantially similar to the Intercreditor Agreement or an amendment to
the Intercreditor Agreement to (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of the
Intercreditor Agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Financial Indebtedness covered by any such
agreement that may be incurred by the Issuer that is subject to any such agreement (provided that such
Financial Indebtedness is incurred in compliance with these Conditions and the terms of the Trust Deed),
(3) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (4) make provision for equal and rateable
pledges of the Transaction Security to secure Additional Notes or to implement any Security permitted
under these Conditions or the Intercreditor Agreement or (5) make any other change to any such
agreement that is not in the opinion of the Trustee materially prejudicial to the interests of the
Noteholders; provided that any amendment to the Intercreditor Agreement will not impose or extend any
personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities,
protections or immunities of the Trustee and/or the Security Agent under these Conditions, the Trust
Deed, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Document; and

(ii) the Trustee and the Security Agent may from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the
Transaction Security Documents to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein or
reflect changes of a minor, technical or administrative nature, (2) provide for any Security permitted
under these Conditions, (3) add to the Transaction Security or (4) make any other change thereto that is
not, in the opinion of the Trustee, materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders.

(d) Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, in connection with the exercise by it of any of its trusts, powers or
discretions (including, without limitation, any modification, waiver, authorisation, determination or substitution),
the Trustee shall have regard to the general interests of the Noteholders as a class but shall not have regard to any
interests arising from circumstances particular to individual Noteholders or Couponholders (whatever their
number) and, in particular but without limitation, shall not have regard to the consequences of the exercise of its
trusts, powers or discretions for individual Noteholders or Couponholders (whatever their number) resulting
from their being for any purpose domiciled or resident in, or otherwise connected with, or subject to the
jurisdiction of, any particular territory and the Trustee shall not be entitled to require, nor shall any Noteholder or
Couponholder be entitled to claim, from the Issuer or any other person any indemnification or payment in
respect of any tax consequence of any such exercise upon individual Noteholders or Couponholders except to the
extent already provided for in Condition 10 (Taxation) and/or any undertaking given in addition to, or in
substitution for, Condition 10 (Taxation) pursuant to the Trust Deed.


-----

(e) Any modification, waiver, authorisation, determination or substitution shall be binding on the Noteholders and
the Couponholders, and any modification, unless the Trustee agrees otherwise, or substitution shall be notified
by the Issuer to the Noteholders as soon as practicable thereafter in accordance with Condition 20 (Notices).

**17.** **THE TRUSTEE**

The Trust Deed contains provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee and for its relief from responsibility,
including provisions relieving it from taking action unless indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its
satisfaction.

Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee may at any time, at its discretion and without notice,
take such proceedings against the Issuer or the Parent as it may think fit to enforce the provisions of these Conditions,
the Trust Deed, the Notes, the Coupons, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Transaction Security Documents (as
applicable), but it shall not be bound to take any such proceedings or any other action in relation to the Trust Deed, the
Notes, the Coupons, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Transaction Security Documents unless (i) it shall have been so
directed by an Extraordinary Resolution of the Noteholders or so requested in writing by the holders of at least 25 per
cent. in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding and shall not have received any contrary direction by an
Extraordinary Resolution of the Noteholders or in writing by the holders of at least 50 per cent. in principal amount of
the Notes then outstanding, and (ii) it shall have been indemnified and/or secured and/or pre-funded to its satisfaction.

The Trustee may rely on any certificate or report of the Issuer's auditors or any other person called for by or provided to
the Trustee (whether or not addressed to the Trustee) in accordance with or for the purposes of the Trust Deed, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Transaction Security Documents notwithstanding that such certificate or report and/or
any engagement letter or other document entered into by the Trustee in connection therewith contains a monetary or
other limit on the liability of the auditors of the Issuer or such other person in respect thereof.

The Trust Deed also contains provisions pursuant to which the Trustee is entitled, inter alia, (a) to enter into business
transactions with the Parent and/or the Parent's other Subsidiaries (including the Issuer) and to act as trustee for the
holders of any other securities issued or guaranteed by, or relating to, the Parent and/or any of the Parent's other
Subsidiaries, (b) to exercise and enforce its rights, comply with its obligations and perform its duties under or in relation
to any such transactions or, as the case may be, any such trusteeship without regard to the interests of, or consequences
for, the Noteholders or Couponholders, and (c) to retain and not be liable to account for any profit made or any other
amount or benefit received thereby or in connection therewith.

The Trustee shall not be required to review or check any accounts or other information provided to it by the Issuer
pursuant to the Trust Deed and shall have no liability to any person as a result of any failure to do so.

**18.** **NO PERSONAL LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND SHAREHOLDERS**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator, member or shareholder of the Issuer will have any liability for any
obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Coupons or the Trust Deed or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by
reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Noteholder by accepting a Note and each Couponholder by accepting
a coupon waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the
Notes. Such waiver and release may not be effective to waive liabilities under the US federal securities laws.

**19.** **FURTHER ISSUES**

The Issuer is at liberty from time to time without the consent of the Noteholders (but subject to compliance with the
provisions of Condition 4.1 (Limitation on Financial Indebtedness)) to create and issue further bonds or notes ranking
_pari passu in all respects (or in all respects save for the first payment of interest thereon) and so that the same shall be_
consolidated and form a single series with the outstanding bonds or notes of any series (including the Notes) constituted
by the Trust Deed or any deed supplemental thereto (the “Additional Notes”). Any Additional Notes shall be
constituted by a deed supplemental to the Trust Deed.

**20.** **NOTICES**

Notices to Noteholders will be valid if published in a leading daily newspaper having general circulation in London
(which is expected to be the Financial Times). The Issuer shall also ensure that all notices are duly published in a
manner which complies with the rules and regulations of the London Stock Exchange and any other listing authority,
stock exchange and/or quotation system on which the Notes are for the time being listed. Any such notice shall be
deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than once or on different dates, on the
first date on which publication is made. Couponholders will be deemed for all purposes to have notice of the contents of
any notice given to the Noteholders in accordance with this Condition.

**WHILE REPRESENTED BY THE GLOBAL NOTES**

The following is an overview of the provisions to be contained in the Trust Deed to constitute the Notes and in the
Global Notes which will apply to, and in some cases modify, the Terms and Conditions of the Notes while the Notes are
represented by the Global Notes.

**1.** **Exchange**

The Permanent Global Note will be exchangeable in whole but not in part (free of charge to the holder) for definitive
Notes only:

(a) upon the happening of any of the events defined in the Terms and Conditions of the Notes (“Conditions”) as
“Events of Default”;

(b) if either Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg is closed for business for a continuous period of 14 days (other
than by reason of holiday, statutory or otherwise) or announces an intention permanently to cease business or
does in fact do so and no alternative clearing system satisfactory to the Trustee is available; or

(c) if the Issuer would suffer a disadvantage as a result of a change in laws or regulations (taxation or otherwise) or
as a result of a change in the practice of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg which would not be suffered
were the Notes in definitive form and a certificate to such effect signed by two Directors of the Issuer is given to
the Trustee.

Thereupon (in the case of (a) and (b) above) the holder of the Permanent Global Note (acting on the instructions of one
or more of the Accountholders (as defined below)) or the Trustee may give notice to the Issuer and (in the case of (c)
above) the Issuer may give notice to the Trustee and the Noteholders, of its intention to exchange the Permanent Global
Note for definitive Notes on or after the Exchange Date (as defined below).

On or after the Exchange Date the holder of the Permanent Global Note may or, in the case of (c) above, shall surrender
the Permanent Global Note to or to the order of the Principal Paying Agent. In exchange for the Permanent Global Note
the Issuer will deliver, or procure the delivery of, an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Notes (having
attached to them all Coupons in respect of interest which has not already been paid on the Permanent Global Note),
security printed in accordance with any applicable legal and stock exchange requirements and in or substantially in the

Global Note will, subject as set out below, be made to the bearer of such Global Note against presentation for
endorsement and, if no further payment falls to be made in respect of the Notes, against surrender of such Global Note
to the order of the Principal Paying Agent or such other Paying Agent as shall have been notified to the Noteholders for
such purposes. A record of each payment made will be endorsed on the appropriate part of the schedule to the relevant
Global Note by or on behalf of the Principal Paying Agent, which endorsement shall be prima facie evidence that such
payment has been made in respect of the Notes. Payments of interest on the Temporary Global Note (if permitted by the
first sentence of this paragraph) will be made only upon certification as to non-U.S. beneficial ownership unless such
certification has already been made.

the Noteholders on the second day after the day on which such notice is delivered to Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
Luxembourg (as the case may be) as aforesaid.

by Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg as to the principal amount of such Notes standing to the account of any
person shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding for all purposes) shall be treated as the holder
of such principal amount of such Notes for all purposes (including but not limited to, for the purposes of any quorum

case may be, the Trustee pursuant to Condition 11 (Events of Default), Condition 12 (Enforcement of Security) and

terms of the Trust Deed. Each Accountholder must look solely to Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case
may be, for its share of each payment made to the bearer of the relevant Global Note.

**5.** **Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer in respect of principal, premium and interest on the Notes represented by a Global Note will

from the relevant Interest Payment Date (in the case of interest).

following its redemption or purchase will be effected by endorsement by or on behalf of the Principal Paying Agent of

them to the Principal Paying Agent by electronic means) of the principal amount of the Notes in respect of which such
option is exercised and at the same time presenting or procuring the presentation of the relevant Global Note to the
Principal Paying Agent for notation accordingly within the time limits set forth in that Condition.

**8.** **Redemption at the Option of the Issuer**

For so long as all of the Notes are represented by one or both of the Global Notes and such Global Note(s) is/are held on
behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, in the event that the Issuer exercises its call option pursuant to
Condition 7.2(a) (Optional Redemption) in respect of less than the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding
at such time, the Notes shall be redeemed on a pro rata basis or, if redemption on a pro rata basis is not permitted by
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg at such time, the standard procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
Luxembourg shall operate to determine which interests in the Global Note(s) are to be subject to such option.

Act 2007 provided they are and continue to be listed on a recognised stock exchange within the meaning of section
1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The London Stock Exchange has been designated as a recognised stock exchange for
these purposes. The Notes will be treated as listed on the London Stock Exchange if they are admitted to the Official
List of the UK Listing Authority and are admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange.

Interest on the Notes may also be paid without withholding or deduction for or on account of UK income tax where
interest on the Notes is paid by a company and, at the time the payment is made, the Issuer (and any person by or
through whom interest on the Notes is paid) reasonably believes that the beneficial owner is within the charge to UK
corporation tax as regards the payment of interest or the payment is made to one of the classes of exempt bodies or
persons set out in sections 935 to 937 of the Income Tax Act 2007, provided that HM Revenue & Customs has not
given a direction that the interest should be paid under deduction of tax.

In cases falling outside the exemptions described above, an amount must generally be withheld from payments of
interest on the Notes that has a United Kingdom source on account of UK income tax at the basic rate (currently 20 per
cent.) subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty.

**Provision of Information by UK Paying and Collecting Agents**
HM Revenue & Customs have powers to obtain information and documents relating to the Notes, including in relation
to issues of and other transactions in the Notes, interest, payments treated as interest and other payments derived from
the Notes. This may include details of the beneficial owners of the Notes, of the persons for whom the Notes are held
and of the persons to whom payments derived from the Notes are or may be paid. Information may be obtained from a
range of persons including persons who effect or are a party to such transactions on behalf of others, registrars and
administrators of such transactions, the registered holders of the Notes, persons who make, receive or are entitled to
receive payments derived from the Notes and persons by or through whom interest and payments treated as interest are
paid or credited. Information obtained by HM Revenue & Customs may be provided to tax authorities in other

countries. See also the paragraph entitled “EU Savings Directive” below which describes obligations to provide reports
of or withhold tax from payments of savings income under Council Directive 2003/48/EC.

**Further United Kingdom Income Tax issues**
Interest on the Notes that constitutes UK source income for tax purposes may, as such, be subject to income tax by
direct assessment even where paid without withholding. However, interest with a UK source received without deduction
or withholding on account of UK tax will not be chargeable to UK tax in the hands of a Noteholder who is not resident
for tax purposes in the UK unless that Noteholder carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the UK through a UK
branch or agency or for holders who are companies through a UK permanent establishment, in connection with which
the interest is received or to which the Notes are attributable. There are exemptions for interest received by certain
categories of agent (such as some brokers and investment managers).

The attention of Noteholders is drawn to Condition 10 (Taxation) of the Notes. The provisions relating to additional
payments referred to in Condition 10 (Taxation) of the Notes would not apply if HM Revenue & Customs sought to
assess the person entitled to the relevant interest or (where applicable) profit on any Note directly to UK income tax.
However, exemption from or reduction of such UK tax liability might be available under an applicable double taxation
treaty.


-----

The above description of the UK withholding tax position assumes that there will be no substitution of the Issuer
pursuant to Condition 14 (Substitution) of the Notes and does not consider the tax consequences of any such
substitution.

The references to “interest” above mean “interest” as understood in UK tax law. The statements above do not take any
account of any different definitions of “interest” or “principal” which may prevail under any other law or which may be
created by the terms and conditions of the Notes or any related documentation.

**United Kingdom Corporation Tax Payers**
In general Noteholders which are within the charge to UK corporation tax (other than investment trusts, venture capital
trusts, authorised unit trusts and open ended investment companies) will be treated for tax purposes as realising profits,
gains or losses (including exchange gains and losses) in respect of the Notes on a basis which is broadly in accordance
with their statutory accounting treatment so long as the accounting treatment is in accordance with generally accepted
accounting practice as that term is defined for tax purposes. Such profits, gains and losses (or where the Noteholder's
functional currency is not sterling, then the sterling equivalent of such profits, gains and losses as computed in the
Noteholder's functional currency) will be taken into account in computing taxable income for corporation tax purposes.

**Other UK taxpayers**

**_Taxation of Chargeable Gains_**
The Notes should constitute “qualifying corporate bonds” within the meaning of section 117 of the Taxation of
Chargeable Gains Act 1992. If they are “qualifying corporate bonds”, a disposal by a Noteholder will not give rise to a
chargeable gain or an allowable loss for the purposes of the UK taxation of chargeable gains. If the Notes are deeply
discounted securities within Chapter 8 of Part 4 of the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005, they will
constitute “qualifying corporate bonds”.

**_Accrued Income Scheme_**
The provisions of the accrued income scheme (the “Scheme”) may apply to certain Noteholders who are not subject to
corporation tax, in relation to a transfer of the Notes. On a transfer of securities with accrued interest the Scheme
usually applies to deem the transferor to receive an amount of income equal to the accrued interest and to treat the
deemed or actual interest subsequently received by the transferee as reduced by a corresponding amount. Generally,
persons who are not resident in the UK and who do not carry on a trade in the UK through a branch or agency to which
the Notes are attributable will not be subject to the provisions of these rules. The Scheme will not apply in relation to
Notes which constitute deeply discounted securities as defined in Chapter 8 of Part 4 of the Income Tax (Trading and
Other Income) Act 2005.

**_Taxation of Discount_**
Depending on the issue price and redemption amount, the Notes may constitute “deeply discounted securities” for the
purposes of Chapter 8 of Part 4 of the Income Tax (Trading and other Income) Act 2005. If the Notes are “deeply
discounted securities”, any gain realised on disposal (including redemption or transfer) of the Notes by a Noteholder
who is within the charge to United Kingdom income tax in respect of the Notes will generally be taxable as income but
such Noteholder will not be able to claim relief from income tax in respect of costs incurred on the acquisition or
disposal of the Notes.

**EU SAVINGS DIRECTIVE**
Under EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income (the “EC Directive”), Member States are
required to provide to the tax authorities of other Member States details of payments of interest and other similar
income paid or secured by a person established in a Member State to, or collected by such person for, an individual
resident, or certain limited types of entity established, in that other Member State. Similar income for this purpose
includes payments on redemption of Notes representing any discount on the issue of Notes or any premium payable on
redemption. However, for a transitional period, Austria and Luxembourg may instead impose a withholding system in
relation to such payments, deducting tax at a rate of 35 per cent. Luxembourg has announced that it will no longer apply
the withholding tax system as from 1 January 2015 and will then commence automatic information exchange under the
EC Directive. The transitional period is to terminate at the end of the first full fiscal year following agreement by certain
non-EU countries to the exchange of information relating to such payments. A number of other countries and territories
have adopted similar measures to the EC Directive.

On 24 March 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted a Council Directive amending and broadening the
scope of the requirements described above. Member States are required to apply these new requirements from 1

January 2017. The changes will expand the range of payments covered by the EC Directive, in particular to include
additional types of income payable on securities. The EC Directive will also apply a “look through approach” to


-----

payments made via certain persons, entities or legal arrangements (including trusts and partnerships), where certain
conditions are satisfied, where an individual resident in a Member State is regarded as the beneficial owner of the
payment for the purposes of the EC Directive. This approach may in some cases apply where the person, entity or
arrangement is established or effectively managed outside of the European Union.

The attention of Noteholders is drawn to Condition 10 of the Terms and Conditions of the Notes.

**The proposed financial transaction tax (“FTT”)**

On 14 February 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission’s Proposal”) for a Directive
for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and
Slovakia (the “participating Member States”).

The Commission’s Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the Notes
(including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances.

Under the Commission’s Proposal the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of
the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a
financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A financial institution may be,
or be deemed to be, “established” in a participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by
transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is
subject to the dealings is issued in a participating Member State.

A joint statement issued in May 2014 by ten of the eleven participating Member States indicated an intention to
implement the FTT progressively, such that it would initially apply to shares and certain derivatives, with this initial
implementation occurring by 1 January 2016.

The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the participating Member States. It may therefore be altered
prior to any implementation. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate.

Prospective holders of Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

**Stamp Duty and SDRT**
It is expected that no stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax will be payable on issue of the Notes or on a transfer of
Notes by delivery.

The Notes are subject to U.S. tax law requirements and may not be offered, sold or delivered within the United States or
its possessions or to a United States person, except in certain transactions permitted by U.S. tax regulations. Terms used

thereunder.

Each Manager has agreed that, except as permitted by the Subscription Agreement, it will not offer, sell or deliver the

will have sent to each dealer to which it sells any Notes during the distribution compliance period a confirmation or
other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes within the United States or to, or for the

under the Securities Act.

In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the offering, an offer or sale of Notes within the United States by
any dealer that is not participating in the offering may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

**United Kingdom**
Each Manager has represented and agreed that:

(A) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of
the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which Section
21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer; and

(B) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it
in relation to any Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

**General**
No action has been taken by the Issuer or any of the Managers that would, or is intended to, permit a public offer of the
Notes in any country or jurisdiction where any such action for that purpose is required. Accordingly, each Manager has
undertaken that it will not, directly or indirectly, offer or sell any Notes or distribute or publish any offering circular,
prospectus, form of application, advertisement or other document or information in any country or jurisdiction except
under circumstances that will, to the best of its knowledge and belief, result in compliance with any applicable laws and
regulations and all offers and sales of Notes by it will be made on the same terms.

**Interest of persons involved in the offer of Notes**
Except as described in this “Subscription and Sale” section, so far as the Issuer is aware, no person involved in the offer
of the Notes has an interest material to the offer, other than certain of the Managers acting as lenders under the Issuer
Facilities.
