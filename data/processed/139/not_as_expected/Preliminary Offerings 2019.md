investment in the Notes. In making an investment decision regarding the Notes, investors must rely on their own
examination of the Issuer and the terms of the offering and the Notes, including the merits and risks involved. Neither this
Prospectus nor any other information supplied in connection with the offering of the Notes constitutes an offer or invitation
by or on behalf of the Issuer, any of the Managers or the Trustee to any person to subscribe for or to purchase any Notes.

This Prospectus is based on information provided by the Issuer and other sources that the Issuer believes are reliable.
Neither the Managers nor the Trustee have independently verified the information contained herein. Accordingly, no

more complete understanding of the discussions.

No person is or has been authorised by the Issuer, the Managers or the Trustee to give any information or to make any
representation not contained in this Prospectus and, if given or made, any other information or representation must not be
relied upon as having been authorised by the Issuer, the Managers or the Trustee.

The information contained in this Prospectus is given as of the date hereof. Neither the delivery of this Prospectus nor the
offering, sale or delivery of the Notes shall, under any circumstances, create an implication that there has been no change in
the information set forth in this Prospectus or in the Group’s business since the date of this Prospectus. The Managers and
the Trustee expressly do not undertake to review the financial condition or affairs of the Issuer during the life of the Notes

be required to bear the financial risks of an investment in the Notes for an indefinite period of time.

This Prospectus does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the Notes in any jurisdiction to any
person to whom it is unlawful to make the offer or solicitation in such jurisdiction. The distribution of this Prospectus and
the offer or sale of Notes may be restricted by law in certain jurisdictions. The Issuer, the Managers and the Trustee do not

any applicable registration or other requirements in any such jurisdiction, or pursuant to an exemption available thereunder,
or assume any responsibility for facilitating any such distribution or offering. In particular, no action has been taken by the
Issuer, the Managers or the Trustee which is intended to permit a public offering of the Notes or the distribution of this
Prospectus in any jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required. Accordingly, no Notes may be offered or sold,

Area which has implemented the Prospectus Regulation (each a “Relevant Member State”) will be made pursuant to an

LON54468925 2


-----

exemption under the Prospectus Regulation, as implemented in that Relevant Member State, from the requirement to
publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. Accordingly any person making or intending to make an offer in that Relevant
Member State of Notes which are the subject of the offering contemplated in this Prospectus, may only do so in
circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or any of the Managers to publish a prospectus pursuant to
Article 3 of the Prospectus Regulation or supplement a prospectus pursuant to Article 16 of the Prospectus Regulation, in
each case, in relation to such offer. Neither the Issuer nor any of the Managers has authorised, nor do any of them authorise,
the making of any offer of Notes in circumstances in which an obligation arises for the Issuer or the Managers to publish or
supplement a prospectus for such offer.

**MIFID II product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market – Solely for the purposes of each**
manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion
that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive
2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and
professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a
"distributor") should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to
MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or
refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS – The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or**
otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the
European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail
client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC
(as amended, the “Insurance Mediation Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as
defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU)
No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them
available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making
them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation.

**MANAGER (OR PERSONS ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE STABILISING MANAGER) MAY OVER-ALLOT**
**NOTES OR EFFECT TRANSACTIONS WITH A VIEW TO SUPPORTING THE MARKET PRICE OF THE**

**OVERVIEW**

_This overview highlights certain information contained in this Prospectus. This overview does not contain all of the_
_information prospective investors should consider before investing in the Notes. Prospective investors should read this_
_entire Prospectus carefully, including the sections entitled “Risk Factors”, “Forward-Looking Statements” and the_
_financial information and the notes included or incorporated by reference elsewhere in this Prospectus._

**HEATHROW AIRPORT**

Heathrow Finance plc (the “Issuer”) is a holding company of Heathrow Airport Limited (“Heathrow”) which owns
and operates Heathrow airport (“Heathrow Airport”), the largest airport in the UK. Heathrow is part of the Group (as
defined below), and also owns the Heathrow Express rail service (as defined below).

Heathrow Airport is the primary airport in London, which is the world’s largest origin and destination aviation market
with over 150 million passengers travelling to and from London annually (Source: IATA Airport IS traffic data for
2018). Heathrow Airport was the seventh busiest airport globally in 2018 and busiest airport in Europe in terms of total
passengers (Source: ACI Dec 2018).

**_Figure 1 Top 10 busiest global airports to 31 December 2018_**

There are over 80 airlines operating at Heathrow Airport offering 108 long-haul and 109 short-haul routes. Heathrow
Airport is one of only four airports globally to offer over 100 direct long-haul connections, underlining its critical role
in the global aviation industry. Heathrow Airport handles approximately 70 per cent. (in terms of seats) of all the UK’s
scheduled long-haul air traffic (Source: IATA Airport IS schedule data for 2018) and five of these routes are within the
top ten intercontinental long-haul routes globally (Source: IATA Airport IS schedule data for 2018). In 2018, Heathrow
Airport handled a record 80.1 million passengers. In the nine months of 2019, Heathrow Airport has continued to grow,
welcoming a record 61.0 million passengers.

Terminal 5 has been awarded the World’s Best Airport Terminal by Skytrax for five consecutive years up to and
including 2016 and Terminal 2 was awarded the World’s Best Airport Terminal by Skytrax in 2018. In 2019, Terminal
5 regained the title as the World’s Best Airport Terminal. Heathrow Airport was named “Best Airport in Western
Europe” by Skytrax for the fifth time in 2019. In 2019, Heathrow Airport also received the award for Best Airport
Shopping for the 10th consecutive year.

Heathrow has continued to achieve strong recognition from passengers for overall service. In the independent Airport
Service Quality ("ASQ") survey conducted by Airports Council International ("ACI"), Heathrow achieved an ASQ
score of 4.16 out of 5.00 in the first nine months of 2019 compared to 4.16 in the first nine months of 2018 and just 3.96
in the first nine months of 2012. This result upholds Heathrow’s position in the top European quartile despite pressures
from record passenger growth and operational disruptions. In addition, in the first nine months of 2019, 82 per cent. of
passengers surveyed rated their Heathrow Airport experience ‘Excellent’ or ‘Very good’, illustrating the strength and
resilience of Heathrow's operation and the benefits of our continued investments.

This result is underpinned by a strong overall operational performance, strong levels of punctuality and high levels of
customer satisfaction across several key service attributes including waiting time at security, cleanliness, wayfinding,

airport staff helpfulness and connections. Its status as one of the best hub airports worldwide was further endorsed by
OAG (an air travel data network) which named Heathrow Airport as the Number 1 ‘most internationally connected
airport in the world’ for 2018.

Heathrow Airport is owned and operated by Heathrow, an indirect subsidiary of the Issuer (the Issuer, together with
Heathrow (SP) Limited, Heathrow (AH) Limited, Heathrow Funding Limited, Heathrow Airport Limited and Heathrow
Express Operating Company Limited (“Heathrow Express”) being the “Group”).

The Group companies are indirect subsidiaries of Heathrow Airport Holdings Limited (“Heathrow Airport Holdings”
and, together with its subsidiaries, the “Heathrow Airport Holdings Group”).

Heathrow Airport Holdings is indirectly owned by investment vehicles controlled or managed by Ferrovial S.A. (25.00
per cent.), Qatar Holding LLC (20.00 per cent.), Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (12.62 per cent.), the
Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (11.20 per cent.), Alinda Capital Partners (11.18 per cent.), China
Investment Corporation (10.00 per cent.) and Universities Superannuation Scheme (10.00 per cent.).

The Group generates two primary types of income:

(i) aeronautical income (£1,745 million or 59 per cent. of total income in 2018 (2017: £1,716 million)), which is

generated from fees charged to airlines for use of Heathrow Airport’s facilities for flight and passenger
activities and is subject to the CAA’s price caps; and

(ii) non-aeronautical income (£1,225 million or 41 per cent. of total income in 2018 (2017: £1,168 million)), which

is generated from retail and other sources, including concession fees from retail operators, direct income from
car parks, property rental income, rail income and other regulated charges for services supplied by Heathrow,
and is taken into account by the CAA in setting its price caps.

**KEY STRENGTHS**

Heathrow has a number of key strengths, deriving from both the commercial strength of the airport and its status as
regulated infrastructure:

- **Unique location advantage: Heathrow Airport enjoys a strong position in the South East of England, one of**
the world’s busiest air traffic markets and a market with growing demand for air travel and limited airport
capacity;

- **Pre-eminent market position: Heathrow Airport is Europe’s busiest airport and the world’s seventh busiest**
airport in terms of total passengers. It handles approximately 70 per cent. (in terms of seats) of all the UK’s
scheduled long-haul air traffic (Source: IATA Airport IS schedule data for 2018). It services a range of market
segments, including business and leisure travellers, origin and destination and transfer passengers, long- and
short-haul routes, and a diversified range of major airlines;

- **Regulatory underpinning: price regulation by the CAA provides significant income predictability and cash**
flow visibility within each regulatory period as well as protection against longer term cost and revenue risks;

-----

- **Proven resilience: the Group has consistently demonstrated its ability to perform and deliver, regardless of**
market trends, shocks and economic downturns;

- **Income diversification: revenue generation from a variety of sources, including charges to airlines,**
concession fees from retail operators, income from car parks, advertising revenue, the rental of airport
premises, the provision of facilities and services and the Heathrow Express rail service;

- **Operational excellence: track record of operating close to its permitted capacity for a number of years,**
delivering large scale construction projects on time and on budget and consistently improving customers’
satisfaction levels, at a lower operating expense;

- **Sustainable Growth: Heathrow has taken a leading approach to sustainably grow the airport via the Heathrow**
2.0 strategy which, in Heathrow's view, reduces long-term growth risk. Heathrow believes that it is important
to use its strong position to drive change in the global aviation industry; and

- **Robust debt financing platform: The Group’s debt financing documents provide creditors with a strong set**
of protections. This includes security over all of the Group’s assets, dividend trigger events, financial and
operating covenants and a strong set of information and reporting requirements.

**STABLE AND RESILIENT TRAFFIC PROFILE.**


Heathrow Airport benefits from historically stable passenger volumes. A key factor in this stability is the unfulfilled
demand that is created by the existing aircraft movement cap and size of airport. As demonstrated by Figure 3,
Heathrow Airport has been operating at close to Heathrow Airport's annual air traffic movement ("ATM") cap for many
years. This cap creates significant demand from airlines to operate from Heathrow Airport which reduces Heathrow
Airport's exposure to individual airlines. Demand from airlines to operate from Heathrow Airport is also supported by
the highly profitable routes that connect via Heathrow Airport. Five of the top ten most profitable long-haul
intercontinental flights operate from or to Heathrow Airport (Source: IATA Airport IS schedule data for 2018).

Heathrow Airport is also predominately a long-haul focussed airport and has a much higher proportion of long-haul
traffic than its European peers. Heathrow also benefits from countercyclicality. In periods where traffic volumes are
declining across the industry, airlines have tended to consolidate traffic towards hubs such as Heathrow Airport in order
to benefit from the higher load factors and yields available from routes that operate from Heathrow Airport.


LON54468925 7


-----

**_Figure 4 Proportion of long-haul traffic to 31 December 2018_**

As a result of these features, in the last traffic downturn in 2008 traffic volumes at Heathrow Airport only declined by
3.4 per cent. from peak to trough, which is significantly lower than that experienced at other European Airports.
London’s profile as a major global city also supports Heathrow Airport's resilient traffic profile as its traffic is well
diversified across tourist, business and visiting friends and family passengers.

**AIRPORT REGULATION**

Heathrow Airport is subject to economic regulation by the Civil Aviation Authority (the “CAA”). Among other things,
the CAA sets the maximum level of airport charges that Heathrow can levy on airlines for using Heathrow Airport’s
facilities. These price caps are generally set for a five-year period (a “Quinquennium”), which may be extended.

This price-setting mechanism provides significant cash flow predictability within each Quinquennium. The price caps
take into account Heathrow’s forecast revenues (both aeronautical and non-aeronautical) and costs as well as allowing
recovery of capital costs and a return on investment capital. The return on capital is based on Heathrow’s opening
Regulatory Asset Base (“RAB”) and its forecast capital expenditure for the Quinquennium. As for other regulated
utilities in the UK, the RAB acts as a unit of regulatory value. The RAB is adjusted on an ongoing basis for capital
expenditure, RPI inflation, regulatory depreciation and proceeds of disposals.

**_Figure 5 Building blocks for tariff calculation_**

The price-setting mechanism provides significant income predictability and cash flow visibility within each regulatory
period and provides substantial explicit protection against costs resulting from new security regulations. In addition, the
reset mechanism included within the regulatory framework ensures that Heathrow is only exposed to passenger volume,
operational expenditure, commercial revenue performance and capital investment delivery risk within each regulatory
period. This provides substantial protection against long-term passenger trends.

**Q6 Extension, iH7 and H7**

The current Quinquennium for Heathrow, Q6, was initially set for four years and nine months from 1 April 2014 to 31
December 2018 in order to align Heathrow’s financial and regulatory years. In December 2016, to deal with the
uncertainty associated with the Government’s decision on the location for capacity expansion in the South East of
England, the CAA announced that it would extend the regulatory period by one year (to end on 31 December 2019),
rolling over the current price control of RPI-1.5 per cent. for the additional year.

LON54468925 8


-----

Given the timetable for the expansion of Heathrow Airport, the CAA has emphasised the need for flexibility and
decided to extend Q6 by a further two years to 31 December 2021.The extended two-year period is known as interim
Heathrow 7 (“iH7”).

Following CAP1769 (the CAA consultation on whether the commercial agreement is in the interest of consumers), the
CAA is also expected to confirm that the price path for iH7 will be RPI-1.5% for the year ending 2020 and 2021. The
CAA also indicated that changes to the timetable (that is, further extensions to Q6) may still be possible if there are
“very significant changes” to the statutory process associated with expansion. Heathrow and the airline community have
reached a commercial agreement that would be implemented alongside the price path of RPI-1.5%. This in effect
removes the need for the CAA to assess the revenue requirement allowed for Heathrow throughout iH7. The CAA has
decided that the commercial agreement is in the interest of consumers, with the necessary licence changes to reflect the
agreement over iH7 expected in November alongside the necessary changes to the licence to extend the price control.

As at the date of this Prospectus, the commercial agreement has been signed by a number of key airlines from multiple
alliances and groups representing more than 85% of Heathrow Airport's traffic. Under the agreement, Heathrow offers a
fixed rebate to all airlines provided a given threshold number of passengers is reached and also offers a volume rebate
associated with airlines’ individual performance. The rebates and threshold are offered and calculated for all airlines,
using consistent principles in a non-discriminatory basis.

The rebate creates an incentive for airlines to make better use of Heathrow Airport’s existing capacity by way of a
volume discount while also providing protection in the event that passenger volumes were to fall below current levels
prior to 2022. Another benefit of the commercial agreement is that it will enable all parties to concentrate on the longer
term aim of securing a regulatory settlement for H7 (as defined below) which will support affordable and financeable
expansion of Heathrow Airport.

The CAA, with the support of the Independent Planner Cost Reviewer (“IPCR”), has assessed whether Heathrow has
efficiently incurred planning permission related costs of £82m for the period 25 October 2016 to December 2017. The
CAA’s decision is that Heathrow can recover £80m of the total spent; it cannot recover £1.2m of these costs, and
further evidence and analysis is required to allow the recovery of £0.8m (of the total £82m). The timing of the
implementation of this decision is yet to be confirmed by the CAA.

**H7 Developments**

The regulatory period commencing at the end of iH7 is known as "H7" ("H7").

There have been a number of regulatory developments related to the expansion of Heathrow Airport, with more
expected during the course of 2019.

The CAA's objective in developing the framework for H7 is to find a framework that facilitates affordable
and financeable delivery of new capacity, driving competition and choice in the best interest of consumers. The CAA
continues to progress its thinking on the H7 framework and launched a new consultation titled “Economic regulation of
capacity expansion at Heathrow: policy update and consultation (CAP1782)” at the end of March 2019. In this
consultation the CAA:

a)  discusses an integrated approach to assessing whether the H7 price control is financeable by considering risk,
incentives and the required return to ensure a financeable outcome;

b)  continues to consider that there are merits to the case for a potential modification to Heathrow's licence by means of
a new condition promoting economy and efficiency in the operation, maintenance and development of the airport;

c)  provides a further update on its approach to issues raised by potential alternative arrangements for delivering new
capacity at Heathrow Airport. The CAA confirms that it does not plan to undertake significant work on alternative
arrangements unless robust evidence emerges that alternative delivery models are in the interest of consumers; and

d)  further investigates the potential introduction of new capital investment incentives and how these may affect the risk
and reward balance.

In July 2019, the CAA published a new consultation titled “Economic regulation of capacity expansion at Heathrow
airport: consultation on early costs and regulatory timetable (CAP1819)”. In this consultation, the CAA consults on the
regulatory treatment of Category B costs (see “Expansion of Heathrow Airport – Regulatory Developments” for
description of Category A, B and C costs) to over £265m, pre-DCO Category C costs and the timetable for H7.
Regarding Category B and pre-DCO Category C costs, the CAA confirms that these costs are in the interest of
consumers and that these should be added to Heathrow’s RAB and if efficiently delivered be recoverable by Heathrow.
In addition, the CAA consults on what is the most appropriate allowed return for these costs in 2020 and 2021 and next
steps to formally give effect to its policy on these costs.

LON54468925 9


-----

Regarding the timetable for H7, the CAA confirms its preference for Heathrow to submit an initial business plan in
December 2019, following which, a period of extensive consultation with the airline community will begin. Reflecting
the feedback received Heathrow would have the opportunity to submit a final business plan for consideration by the
CAA and stakeholders in 2020.

In August 2019, the CAA launched a further consultation titled “Economic regulation of Heathrow Airport Limited
working paper on financial resilience and ring fencing (CAP 1832)”. Consistent with its duties, the CAA aims to ensure
that Heathrow remains financially resilient throughout H7 in order to deliver expansion. In this working paper the CAA
discusses potential alternatives to do so and we agree with the CAA that financeability and financial resilience are
instrumental objectives to delivering expansion.

In addition, in October 2019 the CAA made its final decision regarding surface access policy. This will guide
Heathrow’s future surface access investment. It confirms that Heathrow will be able to recover efficiently invested
surface access investment and costs in accordance with the policy. See “Business—Expansion of Heathrow Airport”
and “Airport Regulation—Airport Regulation Generally” and “Airport Regulation—Heathrow Price Regulation—Q6
_Extension, iH7 and H7”._

**FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE**

The Group has continued to deliver a strong financial performance in recent years due to a combination of:

  - Heathrow delivering record traffic and improvements in service standards and passenger experience;

  - strong retail performance reflecting enhancements to the passenger experience such as refurbishment of
Terminals 3, 4 and 5 and major redevelopment of the luxury retail facilities in Terminals 4 and 5; and

  - a continuing focus on operational improvement and cost control.

As a result, in 2018 the Group saw revenue and Adjusted EBITDA increase by 3.0 per cent. and 4.4 per cent.
respectively. The Group’s financial performance in 2018 reflected, in particular, record traffic levels and cost control.

This underlying performance has continued into 2019 with the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA for the first six months of
the year increasing by 6.8 per cent. compared to the first six months of 2018.

Please also see “Selected Historical Financial Information” on page 40.

**Revenue**

The table below details the Group’s revenue for the years ended 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017 as well as
for the six months ended 30 June 2019 and 30 June 2018 (“6M 2019” and “6M 2018”).

Aeronautical income includes airport fees and other traffic charges paid by airlines to Heathrow. Aeronautical income is
subject to a maximum allowable yield per passenger determined by the CAA.

LON54468925 10


-----

In the year ended 31 December 2018, aeronautical revenue increased 1.7% to £1,745 million (2017: £1,716 million) and
increased 5.2% at £871 million in 6M 2019 versus £828 million in 6M 2018.

Aeronautical income generation in 2018 versus 2017 reflected record traffic growth offset by recoverable yield dilution
as airlines employ cleaner and quieter aircraft as incentivised by our tariff structure. Heathrow continues to deliver
strong value for passengers with average aeronautical revenue per passenger decreasing by 1% to £21.78. (2017:
£22.00)

Aeronautical income generation in 6M 2019 versus 6M 2018 reflected continued record traffic growth, favourable
passenger mix and recovery of prior year yield dilution. This has been somewhat offset by further recoverable current
year yield dilution as airlines employ cleaner and quieter aircraft as incentivised by our tariff structure, and the
introduction of our commercial airline deal.

**Retail income**

Heathrow Airport generates retail income primarily from retail concession fees and car parking income. Third parties
operate all bars, restaurants, specialist shops, duty-free and tax-free outlets and other paid merchant services at the
airport under concessions granted by Heathrow Airport. Heathrow Airport also generates retail income or fees from
other services such as advertising, car rental and bureaux de change.

Heathrow’s retail business has performed strongly in recent years with the key performance indicators for the business,
retail income per passenger, increasing by 5.8 per cent. from £8.45 in 2017 to £8.94 in 2018. The strong performance in
2018 was evident across all revenue streams, with retail concession reflecting higher passenger numbers as well as the
‘call-to-gate’ initiative which increases passenger dwell time in the departure lounges. Retail concessions were
additionally boosted by the roll out of new digital capability on the online Heathrow boutique, allowing customers to
reserve and collect their shopping, with 52 brands now offering this service. Catering also benefitted from the call-togate initiative, and strong performance in the year was further enhanced by refurbishments in Terminals 3 and 5, as well
as ‘Grab & Go’ offerings for passengers to take meals with them on their flights. Other retail reflects a significant
increase in advertising income due mainly to improved utilisation of advertising sites.

Retail income per passenger increased 1.5 per cent. from £8.62 in 6M 2018 to £8.75 in the 6M 2019 benefiting from
increased passenger traffic and a higher percentage of participating passengers. Catering also benefited from an
improved outlet offering whilst luxury goods performed well as the weaker pound makes high value products more
attractive for overseas passengers.

**Other income**

Heathrow generates other income from the provision of operational facilities and utilities to airlines and other
businesses operating at the airport. This income includes rental of systems such as check-in and baggage-handling
facilities and charges for providing electricity, telecommunications and water services. Heathrow Airport also generates
rental income from property such as cargo storage, aircraft hangars, maintenance facilities and office premises and
income from the Heathrow Express rail service.

**Operating costs before depreciation and amortisation**

In the year ended 31 December 2018, the Group’s operating costs before depreciation and amortisation increased by £9
million (0.8 per cent.) from £1,124 million in 2017 to £1,133 million in 2018 and decreased by £2 million (0.4 per cent.)
from £557 million in 6M 2018 to £555 million in 6M 2019.

In 2018, the increase in operating costs was primarily driven by expansion and investment in safety, security and
resilience. In the early part of the year, Heathrow spent over £5 million in ensuring operations ran with limited
disruption during one of the worst winters in recent years. There was also increased investment in special assistance
services, security costs to aid operational resilience and upgrading drone defence capabilities. On a per passenger basis,
costs have declined through cost efficiencies in people-related areas and a decline in business rates, offsetting increased
pension charges including a one-off guaranteed minimum payment equalisation of past service costs, and higher staff
numbers to manage service and resilience while passenger numbers continue to increase.

The lower operating costs in 6M 2019 versus 6M 2018 related to the adoption of International Financial Reporting
Standard 16 – Leases (“IFRS 16”), where £26 million of lease costs are now being reported below EBITDA. Prior to
the adoption of IFRS 16 these costs would have been included in operating costs, above EBITDA. Of the £26 million,
£13 million sits within operational costs, £1 million sits within maintenance costs and £12 million sits within utilities.
Operating costs excluding the application of IFRS 16 have increased, which was primarily driven by increased
investment in growth, resilience, security and passenger experience. Heathrow has spent more on special assistance
services, upgrading drone defence capabilities, security costs to aid operational resilience and keep passengers safe,

LON54468925 11

while passenger numbers continue to increase. Excluding the application of IFRS 16, operating costs in 6M 2019 have
increased 4.1% to £580 million.

**Financing of the Group**

**_Overview_**

Heathrow Airport is the largest wholly-privately financed airport in the world. The Group maintains a diversified multiproduct, multi-currency funding platform which currently incorporates bond issuance in Sterling, Euros, U.S. dollars,
Swiss francs, Canadian dollars, Norwegian krone and Australian dollars together with various other forms of term debt
as well as revolving credit facilities. As at 30 September 2019, the Group had consolidated nominal net debt of £14,175
million of which £12,844 million was within the Issuer’s subsidiaries and £1,331 million was at the Issuer level.

As at 30 September 2019, debt within the Issuer’s subsidiaries comprised £11,487 million in Class A net debt (Class A
bonds are rated A- by S&P and Fitch) and an additional £1,357 million in Class B debt (Class B bonds are rated BBB
by S&P and Fitch) which ranks behind the Class A debt. As at 30 September 2019, the Issuer itself had £1,331 million
in net debt which is serviced from its subsidiaries’ cashflows but is structurally subordinated to the Class A and B debt
within its subsidiaries.

Please see “Debt, gearing and interest cover statistics” on page 43.

**_Financing at the Issuer_**

The Issuer has a combination of loan, bond and privately placed financing in place which comprises:

  - Issuer Facilities:

    - loan facilities of £50 million with a final maturity of 2022 (the “2014 Issuer Facility”);

    - £125 million with final maturities of up to 2026 (the “2016 Issuer Facility 1”);

    - £150 million with a final maturity of 2028, (the “2016 Issuer Facility 2”);

    - £75 million with a final maturity of 2024 (the “2017 Issuer Facility”);

    - £260 million with final maturities up to 2028, expected to be drawn in late 2019 and early 2020 (the
“2018 Issuer Facility 1”);

    - £151.8 million with final maturities up to 2034 (the “2018 Issuer Facility 2”);

    - £250 million with a final maturity of 2031 (the “2019 Issuer Facility 1”);

    - £200 million with a final maturity of 2035 (the “2019 Issuer Facility 2”) expected to be drawn by late
2020; and

    - £100 million with a final maturity of 2035, £50 million of which is drawn and £50 million to be
drawn in 2020 (the “2019 Issuer Facility 3”, together with the 2014 Issuer Facility, the 2016 Issuer

Facility 1, the 2016 Issuer Facility 2, the 2017 Issuer Facility, the 2018 Issuer Facility 1, the 2018
Issuer Facility 2, the 2019 Issuer Facility 1 and the 2019 Issuer Facility 2, the “Issuer Facilities”);

  - £300 million notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”);

  - £250 million notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”);

  - £275 million notes due 2027 (the “2027 Notes)”; and

  - £75 million of private placed debt to be drawn in four instalments ending in May 2020 with a final maturity in
2030 (the “2030 PP”).

The issuance of Notes described in this Prospectus will rank pari passu with the Issuer Facilities, the 2024 Notes, the
2025 Notes, the 2027 Notes and the 2030 PP, and will benefit from the same security package.

**_Financing at the Senior Borrower Group_**

The Senior Borrower Group finances its activities through a mix of senior (Class A) and junior (Class B) term debt
(including bonds) and revolving credit facilities in a variety of tenors, formats and currencies. It hedges a significant
proportion of its interest rate, inflation and currency exposures under an agreed hedging policy.

Bonds are issued by Heathrow Funding Limited under its bond issuance programme, which was established in 2008.

The Senior Borrower Group also has access to various other forms of term debt and revolving credit and liquidity
facilities which have significant undrawn balances.

The Senior Borrower Group uses proceeds of bond issuances, term debt and revolving credit facilities drawings for its
general corporate purposes, including to fund operating and capital expenditure, to pay interest and principal on its
bonds, term debt and revolving loans and, subject to the terms of its financing agreements, to make distributions to
enable the servicing of other parts of the Heathrow Airport Holdings Group’s capital structure, including payments of
interest and principal related to the Issuer’s debt and to enable the payment of dividends to the Heathrow Airport
Holdings Group’s ultimate shareholders.

As at 30 September 2019, the Issuer’s subsidiaries had outstanding £12.1 billion in nominal debt under 39 separate
bond issues with scheduled maturities between 2020 and 2058. At the same date, the Issuer’s subsidiaries had in place:

  - £1,050 million in revolving credit facilities with a final maturity of November 2023 (fully undrawn);

  - £100 million working capital facility with a final maturity of November 2023 (fully undrawn);

  - £16 million in amortising loans from the European Investment Bank with a final maturity of 2022 (fully
drawn);

  - £718 million in term loan facilities with maturities between 2021 and 2029 (fully drawn);

  - £725 million in term notes with maturities between 2026 and 2037 (fully drawn); and

  - £381 million in bonds with maturities between 2035 and 2041 (fully undrawn);

The Group’s debt maturity profile (determined on a nominal basis and excluding £395 million in index-linked
derivative accretion but including £1,086 million in undrawn term debt), as at 30 September 2019, is as shown in the
table below.

**_Liquidity_**

At 30 September 2019, the Group had £3,691 million in cash resources and undrawn debt facilities, including £1,150
million available under revolving credit and working capital facilities, £1,086 million available under term debt and
£1,456 million in cash, cash equivalents and authorised investments.

The Group is cash positive with £1,790 million cash from continuing operating activities in 2018.

The Group expects to have sufficient liquidity to meet all its obligations in full until May 2021. The obligations include
forecast capital investment (including expected investment over the period related to potential expansion), debt service
costs, debt maturities and distributions. The liquidity forecast takes into account the undrawn loan facilities and term
debt as well as cash resources at 30 September 2019 referred to above together with expected operating cash flow over
the period. Under the Senior Borrower Group Indebtedness common terms agreement (the “CTA”), it is required that
projected cashflow from operations after deducting finance charges together with cash at hand and any undrawn
balances under committed facilities exceeds 12 months’ projected capital expenditure.

**Ring-fencing of the Group**

Heathrow Airport Holdings has put in place a ring-fenced long-term debt financing platform for the Group. This
financing platform has been designed to support senior, junior and holding company bond and other term debt,
revolving credit facilities and associated hedging.

The Noteholders will, like the Class A and Class B bondholders, benefit from a range of structural enhancements,
including the following:

- the Group is insulated from Heathrow Airport Holdings insolvency:

    - creditors have full security over both the Issuer and its parent Heathrow (DSH) Limited including a
pledge of shares in both the Issuer and the Security Parent;

    - subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, Noteholders have the power to appoint an administrative
receiver to Heathrow (DSH) Limited and so mitigate the risk of insolvency of the Issuer;

- there are no legal, economic or cash flow dependencies between the Issuer and Heathrow Airport Holdings
Group companies higher up the corporate structure:

    - the Issuer is required to act solely as a holding company of the Security Parent, and its parent,
Heathrow (DSH) Limited, is required to act solely as a holding company for the Issuer;

    - the Issuer has no other assets and no recourse or liability to other parts of the Heathrow Airport
Holdings Group;

    - restrictions are in place on transactions with the wider Heathrow Airport Holdings Group to avoid
value transfer;

- an operational and financial covenant package including:

    - restrictions on the Issuer’s ability to distribute cash outside the Group, including restrictions on
distributions where:

        - _pro forma RAR is greater than 82 per cent. for Class A and Class B debt at the Security_
Parent (compared with 85 per cent. under the CTA). This is designed to provide headroom
within the Class B debt trigger levels at the Security Parent and so provide a liquidity buffer
at the Issuer;

        - _pro forma RAR is greater 92.5 per cent. for debt at the Issuer;_

    - Noteholders benefit indirectly from the covenants (e.g. hedging policy, restrictions on Heathrow’s
activities and sale of key assets) which bind the Senior Borrower Group under the CTA; and

LON54468925 14


-----

    - a covenant that prevents the Senior Borrower Group agreeing to any tighter restrictions on
distributions than are currently in the CTA, so protecting the distributions which the Issuer requires to
service its indebtedness, including the Notes.

For more details on the financing arrangements described above, see “Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Terms
_and Conditions of the Notes in Definitive Form” in this Prospectus._

**_Use of proceeds of the Notes_**

The issuance of the Notes together with the expected use of proceeds outlined below will result in the amount of gross
debt at the Issuer being 12.9 per cent. of Heathrow Airport’s expected RAB at the end of 2019.

The net proceeds of the issue of the Notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes.

**HEATHROW’S STRATEGY**

Heathrow is focused on transforming Heathrow Airport from one of the best airports in Europe to one of the best
airports in the world.

To support and develop Heathrow Airport’s role as a hub, Heathrow intends to continue enabling the success of the
major network airlines operating at Heathrow Airport by investing in further capacity, operational flexibility and
resilience while maintaining sustainable aeronautical charges for airline customers.

Heathrow works continuously to make every journey better through improved service standards to ensure it remains
passengers’ preferred airport. Improving the passenger experience is supported by ongoing investment in modern
airport facilities and operating processes. The Group has invested approximately £9 billion transforming Heathrow
Airport over the last decade, including the opening of Terminal 2 in June 2014. Each of Heathrow Airport’s four
operational terminals is either relatively new or recently refurbished. In 2018, the Group invested £793 million (2017:
£700 million) including expansion-related capital investment. Terminal 5 was awarded the World’s Best Airport
Terminal by Skytrax for five consecutive years up to and including 2016 and Terminal 2 was awarded the World’s Best
Airport Terminal by Skytrax in 2018. In 2019, Terminal 5 regained the titled as the World's Best Airport Terminal.
Heathrow Airport was named “Best Airport in Western Europe” by Skytrax for the fifth time in 2019. In 2019,
Heathrow Airport also was also named the Best Airport for Shopping the tenth year running.

Heathrow has four strategic priorities to help deliver its strategy:

   - **Mojo: making Heathrow a great place to work, helping its people fulfil their potential and working together to**
lead change across Heathrow Airport;

   - **Transforming customer service: aiming to deliver the world’s best passenger experience through working**
with the Heathrow Airport community to transform the service it gives to passengers and airlines;

   - **Beating the plan: aiming to beat the business plan and deliver a competitive return by growing revenue,**
reducing costs and delivering investments efficiently; and

   - **Sustainable growth: working to operate and grow Heathrow Airport sustainably, now and in the future.**

Sustainability is at the core of Heathrow’s strategy to responsibly develop Heathrow Airport to support sustainable
economic growth in the United Kingdom. In February 2017, Heathrow launched Heathrow 2.0, a long-term
sustainability strategy which sets out a series of goals to deliver sustainable growth. The strategic business case for
Heathrow 2.0 comprises four key business benefits. These are:

   - **Maintaining the licence to operate and grow. Managing environmental risks and transforming Heathrow’s**
performance on sustainability to build trust with local, political and NGO stakeholders and position Heathrow
as a leader;

   - **Attracting and retaining talent. Nearly 40 per cent. of millennials have chosen a job because of the relevant**
company’s sustainability approach (survey by Swytch, Feb 2019);

   - **Creating brand preference in response to changing consumer perceptions. Passengers welcome an airport**
experience that induces a sense of emotional well-being as well as meeting their practical needs. Sustainability
can bring a human touch to a functional place; and

   - **Delivering cost efficiencies. Key Heathrow 2.0 objectives such as zero carbon infrastructure, zero waste and**
water reduction deliver cost efficiencies as well as environmental improvements.

LON54468925 15

As a result, Heathrow 2.0 focuses on four pillars as follows:

   - **A Great Place to Work – helping Heathrow's people fulfil their potential;**

   - **A Great Place to Live – working with Heathrow Airport's neighbours to improve their quality of life;**

   - **A Thriving Sustainable Economy – creating opportunities for business to deliver a stronger future for the**
UK; and

##### • A World Worth Travelling – working with Heathrow's industry and regulator to deliver fair and sustainable
air travel for future generations to enjoy.

**EXPANSION OF HEATHROW AIRPORT**

Heathrow Airport has been operating close to its permitted limit on annual flights for a number of years and is the
busiest airport in the world with two or fewer runways, based on its mode and hours of operation. As a result, for a
significant period of time Heathrow has been considering ways to deliver sustainable growth by expanding runway
capacity. The objective is to deliver even greater benefits in Heathrow Airport’s role as the UK’s only hub airport whilst
mitigating the effects of expansion, particularly on local communities.

The expansion of Heathrow Airport comprises a nationally significant infrastructure project (“NSIP”) for the purposes
of the Planning Act 2008 (the “Planning Act”). The Planning Act intends to speed up the decision-making process for
major new infrastructure projects. NSIPs require a type of consent known as ‘development consent’ under procedures
governed by the Planning Act which, where granted, is made in the form of a Development Consent Order (“DCO”).
Heathrow intends to prepare its final proposals and submit its DCO application to the Secretary of State in 2020,
commencing a consent process which will take approximately 18 months from submission of the DCO application to
decision. If Heathrow is granted a DCO, the first flights are expected to begin using the new runway as early as 2026.

The Planning Act provides that the Secretary of State can designate a national policy statement (“NPS”) which sets out
the policy framework against which an application for development consent to construct and operate a NSIP will be
determined. NPSs are subject to public consultation and scrutiny by Parliament before being finalised. The final
Airports NPS (“ANPS”) was approved by Parliament on 25 June 2018. The House of Commons voted 415 to 119 in
favour of the ANPS, a majority of 296. The Secretary of State for Transport formally designated the ANPS on 26 June
2018.

Since approval of the ANPS, Heathrow has been actively developing its DCO application and has made considerable
progress towards delivering a sustainable, affordable and financeable expanded Heathrow Airport. Heathrow remains
committed to delivering expansion responsibly through open and transparent consultation. Heathrow has carried out
three public consultations.

Between January and March 2018, Heathrow consulted on its emerging proposals and options for the expansion of the
airport. Between January and March 2019, Heathrow carried out a second consultation, which focused on airspace
change proposals for its existing two runways and expansions as well as future operations for an expanded airport.

Heathrow launched a statutory consultation on 18 June 2019 (the "June 2019 Consultation") which ran until 13
September 2019 (see “Business—Expansion of Heathrow Airport”). Statutory consultation is required under the
Planning Act prior to submission of a DCO application. Heathrow has assessed all feedback received to date through its
previous consultations to develop its proposal and is currently assessing the feedback from the statutory June 2019
Consultation. Heathrow will use the feedback received via this statutory consultation, and any further engagement after
this date, to finalise the project prior to submission of its DCO application in 2020.

The June 2019 Consultation sought feedback on a number of proposals including:

   - **Heathrow’s draft preferred masterplan for expansion:** Heathrow's proposals for the future layout of the
airport including the runway and other airport infrastructure such as terminals and road access;

   - **plans to operate the future airport: how the future three runway airport will be operated, including important**
elements such as night flights, as well as how additional flights could be operated on Heathrow Airport’s
existing two runways before the new runway opens;

   - **assessment of impacts of Heathrow Airport’s growth:** Heathrow’s preliminary assessment of the likely
impacts of expansion on the environment and local communities; and

LON54468925 16


-----

   - **plans to manage the impacts of expansion:** Heathrow’s plans for mitigating the effects of expansion,
including property compensation, Heathrow's Noise Insulation Policy, a Community Fund, and measures to
mitigate against air pollution, carbon, and other environmental effects.

The June 2019 Consultation set out Heathrow’s draft preferred masterplan and proposed growth in phases – from the
opening of the new runway expected as early as 2026 to the completion of the masterplan in approximately 2050.
Growth in infrastructure between 2026 and 2050 is intended to align closely with forecast passenger growth. The
expansion of the airport creates benefits for consumers as a result of greater competition and will help airlines schedule
and develop new routes, reduce operational impacts to minimise impact on the customer experience and provide
flexibility to respond if passenger growth performs differently to Heathrow’s forecasts.

At each phase of the draft preferred masterplan, Heathrow set out the infrastructure that will be required to
accommodate estimated passenger numbers (million passengers per annum, or mppa). The phasing shown is indicative
and represents key snapshots in time; the speed of delivery of infrastructure could be affected by changing passenger
demand, affordability or other factors. Heathrow has phased its growth proposals as follows:

1) **up to around 2026: new north west runway completed including realignment of the M25, diversion of local**

roads and rivers and completion of surface water treatment requirements;

2) **around 2030 (up to 115 million passengers per annum): partial completion of terminal facilities and satellite**

building, reconfigured cargo areas and some new hotels completed;

3) **around 2035 (up to 130 million passengers per annum): additional terminal and satellite facilities, new**

parking areas and further airport related development including hotels; and

4) **around 2050 (up to 140 million passengers per annum): completion of terminal facilities including**

demolition of Terminal 3 and transformation of the Central Terminal Area.

Subject to obtaining a DCO, the proposed expansion of Heathrow Airport is required to deliver at least 260,000
additional flights per annum at Heathrow Airport. Heathrow’s current draft preferred masterplan considers growth up to
740,000 flights serving approximately 142 million passengers per annum, compared to over 80 million passengers in
2018 and the creation of thousands of jobs in every region across the nation while delivering billions of pounds worth in
economic benefits.

The expansion of Heathrow Airport needs to balance economic benefits with Heathrow’s responsibility to the
environment. The ANPS sets out criteria on carbon, air quality, noise and surface access that Heathrow's expansion
plans need to meet for Heathrow to receive permission to expand. Heathrow believes that a new approach to growing
capacity is the right way for Heathrow Airport to operate sustainably and incentivises Heathrow further to minimise
effects of growth.

Heathrow has proposed a system of environmentally-managed growth, where capacity is released according to a
number of legally binding strict environmental limits encompassing the key environment impacts of carbon, air quality,
noise and surface access. Heathrow proposes that it will only be able to release new capacity if it is operating within
these limits. Heathrow has also proposed publishing environmental performance publicly, clearly and transparently, to
validate its monitoring. This is outlined in the environmentally managed growth framework which was published at the
time of the June 2019 Consultation.

In parallel with the DCO process, Heathrow has also progressed the approval process required to implement the
airspace changes associated with the expansion of Heathrow Airport. The changes to Heathrow’s flight paths follow a
separate approvals process to the physical expansion of Heathrow Airport. To obtain permission for changes to flight
paths, an Airspace Change Proposal is required to be submitted to the CAA. Heathrow intends to undertake a full
public consultation on proposed flight path changes required for expansion in 2022.

Heathrow is also considering a number of changes to help the current two runways operate more efficiently. These
include using Independent Parallel Approaches (“IPA”). The proposed introduction of IPA on Heathrow Airport’s
existing two runways has the potential to increase the efficiency and resilience of the airport and it could also be used to
facilitate the proposed early release of capacity in advance of the third runway being brought into operation. Upon
receipt of DCO consent, it is proposed that the current cap of 480,000 ATMs would be increased. Heathrow is
proposing to implement up to an additional 25,000 ATMs on the existing two runways prior to the third runway being
brought into operation.

**RISK FACTORS**

**_The following sets out certain aspects of the Group’s financing documentation and the activities of the Group about_**
**_which prospective Noteholders should be aware. The occurrence of any of the events described below could have a_**
**_material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Issuer or the Group and_**
**_could lead to, among other things, non-payment of amounts under the Notes._**

_This section of the Prospectus describes all material risks that are known to the Group as at the date of this Prospectus._
_This section of the Prospectus is not intended to be exhaustive and prospective holders of the Notes should read the_
_detailed information set out elsewhere in this document, including the documents incorporated by reference, prior to_
_making any investment decision. Further, prospective holders of the Notes should seek their own legal, financial,_
_accounting, tax and other relevant advice as to the structure and viability of an investment in the Notes._

_In addition, while the various structural elements described in this document are intended to lessen some of the risks_
_discussed below for holders of the Notes, there can be no assurance that these measures will ensure that the holders of the_
_Notes receive payment of interest or repayment of principal from the Issuer in respect of such Notes on a timely basis or at_
_all._

**COMMERCIAL RISKS**

**_The successful implementation of the Group’s capital investment programme could be affected by unanticipated_**
**_construction and consents issues._**

The Group’s capital investment programme includes major construction projects at Heathrow Airport, including the
potential expansion of Heathrow Airport, and is subject to a number of risks. For example, if the Group is not able to
achieve a consensus amongst its airline customers in support of capital investment projects, this could affect the
willingness of the CAA to include the costs of such projects in the RAB. Difficulties in obtaining or discharging the
requirements of any requisite permits, consents, including environmental consents, licences, planning permissions,
compulsory purchase orders or airspace change consents (and related legal challenges) or easements could adversely affect
the design or increase the cost of the capital expenditure projects or delay or prevent the completion of a project or the
commencement of its commercial operation. Although contractors typically share in cost and schedule risks, the Group
may face higher than expected construction costs and delays, not all of which may be permitted by the CAA to be included
in Heathrow Airport’s RAB, and possible shortages of equipment, materials and labour due to the number of major
construction projects in the London area.

The Group’s planned capital expenditure programme has a large number of interdependent programmes of work and a
reliance on suitably qualified and experienced personnel for the delivery of projects.

The commencement of commercial operation of a newly constructed facility may also give rise to start-up problems, such
as the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, or lack of readiness of airline operators, closure of facilities and
disruptions of operations. The Group’s construction contracts may contain restricted remedies or limitations on liability
such that any such sums claimed or amounts paid may be insufficient to cover the financial impact of breach of contract.
The ability of contractors to meet their financial or other liabilities cannot be assured.

The failure of the Group to recognise, plan for and manage the extent of the impact of construction projects could result in
projects overrunning budgets, operational disruptions, capital expenditure trigger rebates to airlines, unsatisfactory
facilities at Heathrow Airport, safety and security performance deficiencies and higher than expected operating costs. Any
of these could affect Heathrow Airport’s day-to-day operations and impact the Group’s reputation and, consequently, have
a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The potential expansion of Heathrow Airport could be delayed due to factors outside the Group’s control._**

The expansion of Heathrow Airport is subject to certain steps, factors and processes outside the control of the Group,
including but not limited to:

    - engagement and formal consultation with Heathrow Airport’s airline community, local communities and the

wider public;

    - engagement and formal consultation with neighbouring and regional local authorities and other statutory

bodies (including Transport for London, the Environment Agency and Natural England);

    - the grant of a DCO (as defined above) by the Secretary of State for Transport following submission of a

detailed application by Heathrow and an examination process conducted by the Planning Inspectorate on

behalf of the Secretary of State;

LON54468925 22


-----

    - any delay to the DCO application/decision process caused by political instability and/or by rival scheme

promoters;

    - the grant of any other planning consents (including, for example, for early works required to facilitate

development relating to expansion) and/or environmental licences and permits required for expansion;

    - airspace change consent from the CAA to make changes to the airspace around Heathrow Airport to support

the North West Runway Scheme (as defined below);

    - successfully defending legal or other challenges to the expansion of Heathrow Airport;

    - accessing debt markets to fund the expansion of Heathrow Airport;

    - competing large infrastructure projects in the UK resulting in human resources and supply chain constraints;

    - competing schemes relating to the development at or around Heathrow Airport; and

    - the construction, delivery and operation of an expanded Heathrow Airport (including in accordance with the

requirements of any/all consents and permits obtained).

While the Group is undertaking significant activity to secure the proposed expansion of Heathrow Airport (see ‘Business—
_Expansion of Heathrow Airport’), any delay or failure to secure or deliver any of the necessary steps or any of the_
processes required in connection with the expansion of Heathrow Airport as expected could in turn delay (or prevent) the
potential expansion of Heathrow Airport, and any such delays could in turn lead to cost overruns and the lack of available
resources relating to the construction, delivery and operation of an expanded Heathrow Airport, which may have a material
adverse effect on the Group’s reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group’s aeronautical income could decline as a result of a reduction in flights, passengers or other factors outside_**
**_the Group’s control which adversely impact the operating resilience of the Group._**

The Group generates aeronautical income from airport fees and traffic charges. These charges are regulated and principally
levied on the basis of passenger numbers, maximum total aircraft weight, aircraft noise and emission characteristics and
the length of time for which an aircraft is parked at the airport. The charges are also linked to the rate of inflation, which is
liable to change (both as a result of the performance of the UK economy and also as a result of changes to the basis on
which RPI and / or CPI are calculated). There are no specific operating contracts with the airlines operating at Heathrow
Airport. There can therefore be no assurance as to the level of the Group’s future aeronautical income from any one or
more airline operators. Decisions by, legal disputes with, financial difficulties at, or the failure of, a significant airline
customer, or the withdrawal of their landing rights, could lead to a reduction in flights and passenger numbers and/or
failure or delay in recovering airport fees or landing charges. The effect of decisions by or events at airlines that have a
major presence at Heathrow Airport could have a material adverse effect on the Group.

The number of passengers using Heathrow Airport may be affected by a number of other factors, including:

   - industrial action that affects critical services at Heathrow Airport, including at airlines;

   - wars, riots or political action;

   - acts of terrorism or cybersecurity threats and attacks;

   - changes in domestic or international regulation, including international trade liberalisation developments such as
Open Skies (as defined below);

   - shocks to the macroeconomic environment (including any impact of the UK exiting the European Union, changes
in fuel prices and currency exchange rates, inflation, employment and spending) whether affecting the global
economy, the UK economy or the Greater London economy in which Heathrow Airport is based;

   - an increase or decrease in competition from UK and non-UK airports;

   - unauthorised use of drones;

   - protest activity;

   - an increase in airfares;

   - airline bankruptcies;

   - decisions by airlines regarding the number, type and capacity of aircraft (including the mix of premium and
economy seats), as well as the routes on which particular aircraft are utilised;

   - health scares, epidemics or pandemics across the globe;

LON54468925 23


-----

disruptions caused by natural disasters or events, for example, the closure of airspace due to the volcanic eruption
in Iceland in 2010;

   - extreme weather at Heathrow Airport or other airports, such as the severe winter weather experienced in the
northern hemisphere in December 2010 which caused over 4,000 flights to be cancelled at Heathrow Airport and
significant impact to airline schedules globally;

   - the quality of services and facilities, including the impact of construction projects; and

   - the development of efficient and viable alternatives to air travel, including the improvement or expansion of
existing surface transport systems, the introduction of new transport links or technology and the increased use of
communications technology.

The Group, where possible, seeks to anticipate the effects of the events noted above in its operations and also maintains
contingency plans to minimise disruption and passenger inconvenience, including contingency plans aiming to mitigate the
impacts of potential industrial action. In addition, the Group has a range of formal national and local consultative bodies to
discuss pay, employment conditions and business issues with trade unions. Collective bargaining takes place with the
unions Unite, PCS and Prospect for those employee groups for which these unions are recognised, with the Group
committed to implementing changes affecting people fairly.

There can be no guarantee that the Group’s contingency plans would be effective in anticipating the effects of the factors
noted above. Any of these factors could negatively impact the Group’s reputation, affect Heathrow Airport’s day-to-day
operations and result in a decrease in the number of passengers using Heathrow Airport which could in turn have a
material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_A decrease in passenger numbers or other factors outside the Group’s control could reduce non-aeronautical income._**

The Group’s principal sources of non-aeronautical income include retail concession fees, car parking income, property
rental income, rail income and income from the provision of operational facilities and utilities.

Retail concession fees are driven by passenger numbers and propensity of passengers to spend in the shops at Heathrow
Airport. As noted above, there are a variety of factors which could adversely affect the number of passengers using
Heathrow Airport. Levels of retail income may also be affected by changes in the mix of long- and short-haul and transfer
and origin and destination passengers; economic factors, including exchange rates and changes in duty free or VAT
reclaim regimes; retail tenant failures; lower retail yields on concession re-negotiations; redevelopments or
reconfigurations of retail facilities at Heathrow Airport, which can lead to a temporary or permanent decline in retail
concession fees; reduced competitiveness of the airport retail offering; stricter hand luggage and other carry-on
restrictions; and reduced shopping time as a result of more rigorous and time consuming security procedures. Car parking
income could be reduced as a result of increased competition from other modes of transport to Heathrow Airport, such as
buses and trains, as well as increased competition from off-site car parks. Rail income could be reduced as a result of
additional direct rail connections to Heathrow Airport following the expected commencement of Elizabeth Line services
between central London and Heathrow Airport. Other non-aeronautical income could be reduced as a result of a decrease
in demand from airport users, such as car rental operators and airlines leasing check-in counters or other facilities. Any of
these factors could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group could be subject to terrorism and/or increased security requirements._**

The UK Government currently assesses the international terrorism threat to mainland Britain as “substantial”, the third
highest threat level on the government’s risk assessment scale. Heathrow Airport operates within a stringent and complex
security regime as required by the Government, which has imposed additional security measures from time to time, for
example following the discovery of terrorist plots in August 2006 and December 2009. An incident in 2010 involving
cargo aircraft led to additional measures for the cargo industry only. The consequences of any future terrorist action or
threat may include cancellation or delay of flights, impact on the ability of passengers and employees to access Heathrow
Airport and any facilities associated with or required in connection with the operation and management of Heathrow
Airport, fewer airlines and passengers using Heathrow Airport, liability for damage or loss and, the costs of repairing
damage and impact on day-to-day operations including the ability to operate and manage Heathrow Airport.

The implementation of additional security measures at Heathrow Airport in the future could lead to additional limitations
on airport capacity or retail space, overcrowding, increases in operating costs and delays to passenger movement through
the airport, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_Incidents could occur at Heathrow Airport._**

Airports are exposed to the risk of incidents, including accidents, as a result of a number of factors, including extreme
weather conditions, equipment failure, unauthorised use of drones, political protest, human error and terrorist activities.
These incidents could result in injury or loss of human life, damage to airport infrastructure and short- or long-term closure

LON54468925 24


-----

of Heathrow Airport s facilities and may have an impact on the operation of Heathrow Airport and passenger traffic levels,
which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group’s insurance coverage might not be adequate or available in all circumstances._**

The Group benefits from insurance cover to protect against key insurable risks including terrorism and business
interruption. Cover may not be adequate to cover lost income, reinstatement costs, increased expenses or other liabilities.
Moreover, there can be no assurance that if insurance cover is cancelled or not renewed, replacement cover will be
available at commercially reasonable rates or at all.

The Group may not have, or may cease to have, insurance cover if the loss is not covered under, or is excluded from, an
insurance policy including by virtue of a deductible applying, exhaustion of applicable cover limits or a policy operating as
an excess policy or if the relevant insurer successfully avails itself of defences available to it, such as breach of disclosure
duties, breach of policy condition or misrepresentation.

Insurance cover for the Group is currently, and may in the future be, provided by a combination of insurance market
entities and captive insurance companies owned by, or affiliated with, Heathrow Airport Holdings or its ultimate
shareholders. Any of these insurers could cease to offer current insurance cover, become insolvent or lose their licences or
authorisations. Any failure to obtain insurance or to collect under relevant insurance policies could have a material adverse
effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Heathrow and Heathrow Express (together, the “Operating Companies” and each, an “Operating Company”) could be_**
**_subject to periodic increase in pension cash contributions in the future._**

Under the Shared Services Agreement, LHR Airports is entitled to pass its pension costs on to the Operating Companies.
The costs of the pension schemes, primarily in relation to the defined benefit pension scheme (the “Pension Scheme”),
may vary from time to time (for instance as a result of fluctuation in investment values or as a result of changes to actuarial
assumptions). The Group expects pension costs, including the costs of reducing any deficit, to be treated by the CAA as
operating costs in setting price caps, but there is no guarantee that the CAA will do so.

The most recent actuarial valuation of the Pension Scheme, undertaken by the Pension Trustee as at 30 September 2018,
concluded in October 2019 and indicated a scheme deficit of £123 million calculated using the Pension Trustee’s actuarial
assumptions. As part of the valuation process, LHR Airports and the Pension Trustee agreed that the annual deficit
recovery payment into the Pension Scheme would decrease from £23 million to £20 million. These payments are intended
to eliminate the deficit by 30 September 2022.

The Pension Scheme’s trustee is a Borrower Secured Creditor pursuant to the STID and ranks equally in an amount up to
£284 million with senior (Class A) debt. The extent of any deficit or surplus to the Pension Scheme, which may vary
significantly from one accounting period to another, results from factors outside the control of the Group.

Increases in the Group’s pension cash contributions could, because they are not fully taken into account by the CAA in
setting price caps, have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. See
“Business – Pensions”.

**_The Group faces a number of operational risks outside its control._**

The operation of an airport is a complex undertaking that is subject to a number of factors outside the control of the Group.
These factors include weather conditions, climate change, variable aircraft movements and traffic congestion. In particular,
if climate change results in more volatile weather, such as a greater frequency and intensity of storms, this could disrupt
the operation of Heathrow Airport by reducing airport capacity and/or affecting the ability of passengers and/or employees
to access Heathrow Airport and any facilities associated with or required in connection with the operation and
management of Heathrow Airport. Passenger attitudes to environmental and climate issues may also change and this may
lead to a reduced demand for air travel or reputational consequences. In addition, the Secretary of State for Transport has
powers under the Airports Act 2006 to give directions to airport operators in the interests of national security, including
closure of airports. Given the nature of these factors, it is not possible to accurately predict their future impact on airport
operations from past performance, and any impact from such factors could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group’s revenue could decline as a result of changes in the Group’s operating environment._**

Changes in the Group’s operating environment, such as long-term changes in passenger demand for air travel, could lead
to a misaligned operational capacity within the Group. While the Group carries out evaluations through a series of scenario
planning exercises, there can be no assurance that the Group can identify the timing or period of any such changes or that
once identified, the Group will be able to realign the operational capacity of the Group and implement change management
successfully which could lead to a shortfall in the Group’s revenue.

**_Operations and passenger experience at Heathrow Airport depend upon third parties, whose performance the Group is_**
**_unable to control._**

The Group depends on the co-operation of a large number of third parties, including government agencies and business
partners, to provide essential functions, such as air traffic control, border control, utilities infrastructure, the management
of fuel storage and distribution assets, baggage system operation and maintenance, passenger check-in, re-fuelling, rescue
and firefighting services, utilities provision, catering and information technology. The Group works to manage its
relationship with such third parties, for example the Group’s management of contracts with third party suppliers is
underpinned by robust and responsible procurement practices which involve the consideration of the resilience and
sustainability of third party suppliers before contracts are entered into with such third parties, and the frequent monitoring
of the operational performance of such third parties once contracts are commenced. There can be no guarantee that the
Group’s management of third parties will be effective, and the Group’s business operations and the experience of
passengers at Heathrow Airport may be affected if these third parties do not adequately perform the services they are
required to provide. In particular, a failure by these third parties to appropriately respond to passenger volumes, accidents,
fire, technical defects or failures in IT or data processing may cause flight delays, damage to facilities, and the cancellation
of airport services. Any of these events or a combination of events related to the performance of third parties could have a
material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group companies enter into contracts with third parties which require them to give representations, covenants and_**
**_indemnities, which could expose the Group to litigation._**

The Group companies enter into contracts with third parties under which they have given or will give representations,
covenants and indemnities as part of the transactions to which the contracts relate. Entry into such contracts gives rise to a
risk of litigation relating to the representations, covenants and indemnities which, if significant, could have a material
adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group is dependent on LHR Airports as the Shared Services Provider to operate its businesses._**

LHR Airports employs staff assigned to Heathrow. Pursuant to the Shared Services Agreement, LHR Airports also
provides various central support services (including senior management and strategic direction), administration, cash
management and operational services, including the provision of IT services and staff, to the Operating Companies as
described in more detail in “Business – Shared Services”. Heathrow, as a subcontractor for LHR Airports, provides certain
central support services to Heathrow Express. Whilst the Shared Services Agreement contains provisions that are designed
to assist with the transfer of employees and services to the Operating Companies or a replacement services provider, if the
Shared Services Agreement were terminated, there can be no assurance that transfers will be effected in a manner that does
not have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group could face operational disruption, inconvenience to passengers and long-term reputational damage as a_**
**_result of compromises to the security of those affected by the activities of the Group._**

The Group is responsible for ensuring that its assets, infrastructure, human and electronic systems and processes meet the
minimum statutory requirements to protect aviation security, deliver high security standards and build confidence with
regulators, airlines and passengers. It also needs to ensure that its assets, infrastructure, human and electronic systems are
protected from theft, damage or intrusion.

The Group has a responsibility to ensure aviation security and safeguard the welfare and safety of staff, business partners
and the public who may be affected by the activities of the Group.

Security risks are mitigated by adopting and enforcing rigorous policies and procedures supported by professional training
and by investment in leading edge security technology. The Group works closely with airlines and government agencies,
including the police, in building a framework to establish joint accountabilities for airport security and shared ownership
of risk, thus ensuring security measures remain both flexible and proportionate to the prevailing threat environment.

While the Group is taking steps to discharge its responsibilities effectively and to avoid compromises to the security of
those affected by the activities of the Group, there can be no guarantee that steps taken by the Group will be effective. A
failure to exercise this responsibility effectively could result in operational disruption, inconvenience to passengers and
long-term damage to the Group’s reputation, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group could face disruption from cybersecurity threats to its data and systems and/or non-compliance with the_**
**_Security of Network & Information Systems Regulations could result in regulatory action which could have a_**
**_significant impact on the Group._**

Heathrow faces external cyber threats to its data and systems. Heathrow’s data and systems may be vulnerable to theft,
loss, damage and interruption due to unauthorised access, security breaches, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, power loss,
or other disruptive events. In addition, the CAA has determined that Heathrow is an “operator of essential services” (an

LON54468925 26


-----

**OES ) for the purposes of the Security of Network & Information Systems Regulations (the** **NIS Regulations ). As an**
OES, Heathrow has to take appropriate and proportionate security measures to manage risks to its network and information
systems, and it will be required to notify serious incidents to the CAA. A security breach could have a negative impact on
customer confidence in Heathrow’s systems and negatively impact Heathrow’s reputation. In addition, a failure to comply
with the requirements of the NIS Regulation could result in enforcement action being taken against Heathrow, including
levying substantial fines. Should a security breach and/or non-compliance with the NIS Regulation occur, this could result
in operational disruption, inconvenience to passengers and long-term damage to the Group’s reputation, which could in
turn have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**REGULATORY RISKS**

**_Heathrow is subject to economic regulation by the CAA, which is subject to change._**

Heathrow faces the risk of adverse change to its economic regulation by the CAA. See _“Business—Expansion of_
_Heathrow Airport” and “Airport Regulation—Airport Regulation Generally” and “Airport Regulation—Heathrow Price_
_Regulation—Q6 Extension, iH7 and H7”._

Heathrow is subject to economic regulation by the CAA. Among other things, the CAA sets the maximum level of airport
charges that Heathrow can levy on airlines for using Heathrow Airport’s facilities. These price caps are generally set for a
Quinquennium, which may be extended. The CAA published its final decision in relation to the current Quinquennium for
Heathrow, Q6, on 10 January 2014. Q6 was initially set for four years and nine months from 1 April 2014 to 31 December
2018, Q6, on 10 January 2014. The CAA’s final decision details the price controls for the period, including the maximum
allowable annual yield per passenger at RPI-1.5 per cent.

In December 2016, to deal with the uncertainty associated with the UK Government’s decision on the location for capacity
expansion in the south east of England, the CAA announced that it would extend the regulatory period by one year (to end
on 31 December 2019), rolling over the current price control of RPI-1.5 per cent. for the additional year.

The CAA subsequently extended Q6 by a further two years to 31 December 2021. The extended two-year period is known
as interim Heathrow 7 (“iH7”). However, the CAA states that changes to the timetable may still be possible if there are
“very significant changes” to the statutory process associated with expansion.

The CAA is also developing a framework for Heathrow’s next regulatory period (“H7”) currently scheduled to begin on 1
January 2022. The CAA’s objective is to find a framework that facilitates affordable and financeable delivery of new
capacity, driving competition and choice in the best interest of consumers. The CAA continues to progress its thinking on
the H7 framework and launched a new consultation titled “Economic regulation of capacity expansion at Heathrow airport:
consultation on early costs and regulatory timetable (CAP1819)”. In this consultation the CAA consults on the regulatory
treatment of Category B costs over £265m, pre-DCO Category C costs and the timetable for H7. Regarding Category B
and pre-DCO Category C costs, the CAA confirms that these costs are in the interest of consumers and that these should
be added to Heathrow’s RAB and if efficiently delivered be recoverable by Heathrow. In addition, the CAA consults what
is the most appropriate allowed return for these costs in 2020 and 2021 and next steps to formally give effect to its policy
on these costs. Regarding timetable for H7, the CAA confirms its preference for Heathrow to submit an initial business
plan in December 2019, a period of extensive consultation with the airline community will follow the initial plan.
Reflecting the feedback received Heathrow would have the opportunity to submit a final business plan (for CAA and
stakeholders’ consideration) in 2020.

The CAA has established performance-linked requirements which can negatively impact aeronautical income. For
example, the permitted yield in respect of airport charges at Heathrow Airport can be reduced if prescribed milestones are
not met on certain capital investment projects. In addition, under the service quality rebate scheme for the current
regulatory period, failure to meet specified targets relating to, among other things, airport cleanliness, security queuing
times, flight information displays and stand and jetty availability can result in rebates to airline customers of up to 7 per
cent. of airport charges. See “Airport Regulation—Heathrow Price Regulation—SQRB Scheme”.

The Group works to mitigate this risk by having in place a dedicated project team to engage with and maintain a sound
relationship with the CAA as well as advise the Group on regulatory matters in order to ensure full compliance with
existing regulatory requirements and to liaise with the CAA on its proposed changes to the economic regulation of
Heathrow. The regulatory framework also requires formal engagement with airline customers, and the Group invites
airlines to send representatives to engagement fora such as joint steering groups to mitigate the risk of adverse airline
relations. Key stakeholders are engaged on a joint planning basis which provides airlines with the opportunity to articulate
their views and on-going requirements.

There can be no assurance that the Group’s strategy for mitigating the risks associated with the economic regulation of
Heathrow set out above will be successful, nor that the current or future price caps set by the CAA will be sufficient to
allow Heathrow to operate at a profit; nor that the present price caps will be increased or at least maintained at current
levels; nor that the methodology of the review process at subsequent reviews will be consistent with previous practice, any
of which could result in a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

LON54468925 27


-----

**_Heathrow is subject to an economic licensing regime._**

The legislative framework prescribes that Heathrow operates under a licence granted by the CAA, which has no expiry
date. However, in certain limited circumstances, such as a continued failure by Heathrow to comply with the conditions of
the licence, the licence may be revoked by the CAA. For more information on the economic licensing regime, see “Airport
_Regulation – Principles of Economic Regulation” and “Airport Regulation – Heathrow Price Regulation”. Any revocation_
of the licence could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

Additionally, the licence may be amended by the CAA in the future through a prescribed licence modification process.
Although this will be subject to a right of appeal by Heathrow, the licence could be amended in a way that adversely
affected the ability of the Group to finance its business at reasonable rates, which could have a material adverse effect on
the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group could face other strategic, regulatory and public policy constraints._**

Income and/or operations at Heathrow Airport could be adversely affected by changes in public policy regarding route
licensing, the “use it or lose it” rule under which airlines are required to fly 80 per cent. of their slots or sacrifice them to
other airlines, changes to the conditions for the maintenance of the Heathrow Airport aerodrome licence, security and
safety, immigration and border controls, airport development, environmental policy, tax, air passenger duty or the
provision of airport capacity. In the event that unforeseen strategic, regulatory and/or public policy constraints are
imposed, this could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group could face costs related to environmental, health and safety and planning considerations._**

The Group’s business is affected by a wide variety of EU and UK environmental, health and safety and planning laws and
requirements.

The Group’s existing operations may be impacted by a number of environmental and planning factors, including those
involving aircraft movements; climate change; air quality (including emissions standards); noise; energy use and
efficiency; soil and water pollution arising from airport operations; discharges and surface water drainage; land and
groundwater contamination; flooding; drought; asbestos in premises and exposure to asbestos; and waste handling,
management and disposal.

The Group consults and engages with the community in which it operates to ensure the concerns of the community are
taken into account. The Group also has in place proactive environmental management systems and employee training
programmes are embedded within the Group’s operations through clear environmental strategies and resource
conservation initiatives.

The Group recognises that a failure to exercise its responsibility to ensure that it safeguards the welfare and safety of its
people, business partners and the public who may be affected by the Group’s activities effectively risks operational
disruption, inconvenience to passengers and long-term damage to the Group’s reputation which could in turn have a
material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Group’s safety
management system includes risk assessment processes for all activities entailing significant risk and proportionate control
measures employed to safeguard everyone impacted by the Group’s business. The Group also operates robust asset
management processes to ensure property and equipment remains safe. Governance, led by the Group’s senior
management teams, and assurance processes are used to ensure that controls around health and safety risks remain
effective and continuous improvement is encouraged.

Compliance with present or future environmental, health and safety and planning requirements may be costly and timeconsuming and interfere with the Group’s existing activities and operations. Non-compliance, in particular with
environmental laws and requirements, could have a negative impact on the Group’s reputation which could in turn
jeopardise the Group’s licence to operate. The CAA has to date taken environmental costs incurred by the Group into
account when determining the RAB and in setting price caps. The CAA has not indicated that it intends to change its
policy in this regard in the future, but, if it were to do so, this could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group could face fines for non-compliance with competition laws and regulations._**

Competition authorities exercise considerable discretion in setting levels of fines for non-compliance with competition
laws and regulations. Given the position of Heathrow Airport in certain markets, any failure to comply with applicable
competition laws and regulations may result in the Group incurring substantial fines or settlement costs, as well as
suffering significant reputational damage, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_Non-compliance with the Group’s internal corporate governance requirements could have a significant impact on the_**
**_Group’s reputation and brand._**

LON54468925 28


-----

The Group has in place internal corporate governance requirements based on applicable laws, rules and requirements such
as the Bribery Act 2010. To ensure that the Group’s operations are executed in accordance with these requirements, the
Group’s management processes include Professional Conduct Policy and other Group policies as well as a Group
approvals procedure which governs the Group’s processes and operations. The Group regularly performs communication
and training in these areas, and monitors and audits internal compliance with these requirements. There is however no
guarantee that violations of the Group’s internal corporate governance requirements will not occur, which could have
material adverse effects on the Group’s reputation and brand, and result in fines which could in turn have a material
adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Future regulatory settlements may not allow for increased operating costs._**

Operating costs may differ from projections. There can be no assurance that future price caps set by the CAA will be
sufficient to allow Heathrow to cover its operating costs, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Non-compliance with Data Protection Legislation (2016/679/EU) could result in regulatory action or civil claims which_**
**_could have a significant impact on the Group_**

Heathrow is subject to significant obligations in respect of data protection legislation. In the event Heathrow is unable to
meet such obligations, it may be subject to regulatory action or civil claims. The General Data Protection Regulation
(2016/679/EU), which applied to all UK companies including Heathrow from May 2018, permits national supervisory
authorities to levy administrative penalties of up to 4 per cent. of companies’ global annual turnover in cases of significant
non-compliance. Additionally, Heathrow may be subject to claims for material and non-material damage from groups of
affected customers and employees. The cost of regulatory or legal action, and any reputational damage suffered as a result
of such action, could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**FINANCING RISKS**

**_Given its leverage position, the Group will need to raise further debt from time to time._**

The Group will need to raise further debt from time to time in order, among other things, to:

(a) finance future capital expenditure including the expansion of Heathrow Airport; and

(b) enable it to refinance and/or repay indebtedness, including the Notes, as such indebtedness becomes due.

There can be no assurance that the Group will be able to raise future finance on terms that are economically viable or at all.
For instance, events in the credit markets in 2007 and 2008, and regulatory uncertainty in 2009, significantly restricted the
Group’s ability to raise finance. In addition, under the terms of the Senior Borrower Group Indebtedness, if Heathrow is
unable to replace a liquidity facility under certain circumstances, it will not be permitted to incur any further indebtedness,
including issuing bonds under the multicurrency bond programme of Heathrow Funding Limited.

An inability to refinance and/or repay its indebtedness or incur any further indebtedness could have a material adverse
effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group is subject to exposure on its hedging arrangements._**

Whilst the Group operates a hedging programme in accordance with the hedging policy under the terms of the Senior
Borrower Group Indebtedness, it is not required to fully or perfectly hedge its present or future interest rate, foreign
currency or inflation exposure and may not in practice do so. The hedging policy appears as Schedule 5 to the CTA which
is incorporated by reference in this Prospectus. The Group is subject to the creditworthiness of, and in certain
circumstances early termination of the hedging arrangements by, hedge counterparties.

Changes in interest, foreign currency and inflation rates, and exposure to hedge counterparty risk, could have a material
adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_A significant portion of the Group’s cash flow from operations is dedicated to debt payments._**

Because of the secured nature of its borrowings and the structure that applies to them, the Group has been able to raise
more debt than would typically be the case for an unsecured borrower. As a result, a greater portion of the Group’s cash
flow from operations is dedicated to payments on its debt obligations, thus reducing its flexibility to deal with significant
financial underperformance. This may increase the Group’s vulnerability to any economic downturn in its business or to
adverse industry conditions, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial
condition and results of operations.

LON54468925 29

**_Given its leverage position, the Group will need to raise further debt from time to time._**

The Group will need to raise further debt from time to time in order, among other things, to:

(a) finance future capital expenditure including the expansion of Heathrow Airport; and

(b) enable it to refinance and/or repay indebtedness, including the Notes, as such indebtedness becomes due.

There can be no assurance that the Group will be able to raise future finance on terms that are economically viable or at all.
For instance, events in the credit markets in 2007 and 2008, and regulatory uncertainty in 2009, significantly restricted the
Group’s ability to raise finance. An inability to refinance and/or repay its indebtedness or incur any further indebtedness
could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, under the terms of the Senior Borrower Group Indebtedness, if Heathrow is unable to replace a liquidity
facility under certain circumstances, it will not be permitted to incur any further indebtedness, including issuing bonds
under the multicurrency bond programme of Heathrow Funding Limited.

**_Ability to incur more debt._**

The Group may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future. Neither the terms of the Notes nor the Issuer
Facilities prohibit the Group from incurring more indebtedness (subject to satisfaction of certain conditions). If new debt is
added to the Group’s current debt levels, the related risks that the Group now faces could intensify.

**LEGAL RISKS**

**_General risk relating to the impact of the UK exiting the European Union._**

In a UK referendum held on 23 June 2016, a majority voted for the UK to leave the European Union (the “EU”)
(“Brexit”). On 29 March 2017, the UK Government formally began the Brexit process by notifying the European Council
of its intention to leave under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (“Article 50”). The UK was initially due to
leave the EU on 29 March 2019, and it was expected that a withdrawal agreement between the UK and the EU (the
“Withdrawal Agreement”) would be implemented into UK law before that date. If implemented in its current form (as at
the date of this Prospectus), the Withdrawal Agreement would provide for a transition period until at least December 2020
(the “Transition Period”). During the Transition Period, UK would continue to be treated by the EU as an EU Member
State and the UK would remain bound by applicable EU law.

On 28 October 2019, the UK and the EU agreed a further extension to Article 50 to 31 January 2020. The extension may
be curtailed at any time before 31 January 2020 if the Withdrawal Agreement is implemented into UK law. Until the UK
formally leaves the EU under the provisions of Article 50, it remains an EU Member State and is bound by applicable EU
law.

The next steps that may be taken by the UK Government regarding Brexit are uncertain, especially in light of there being a
general election in the UK in December 2019. A new Government is likely to shape the direction of the UK negotiations
with both EU leaders and UK MPs.

It is extremely difficult to predict the Brexit outcome for the UK in the near to medium term. Specifically, it is not possible
at this point to determine the nature or extent of any final agreement between the UK and the EU or the precise impact that
Brexit and/or any related matters may have on the UK or the Group’s business, financial condition and results of
operations. Possible risks to the Group could include, but are not limited to:

  - macro-economic factors, including lower economic growth in the UK, greater volatility in the currency markets,
and the introduction of new trade barriers, which may have a negative impact on Heathrow Airport’s traffic,
operations and the cost of travel, and in turn the demand for air travel;

  - market restrictions between the UK and the EU, including the UK losing its access to the single aviation market
and the benefit of other air service agreements, which may impact passengers as airlines modify their ownership
structures and re-route aircraft, potentially leading to increased costs and affecting the demand for air travel (for
more information regarding air service agreements, including the replacement of the EU-US Open Skies
Agreement, please see “Air Service Agreements, Open Skies and Brexit”); and

  - access to skills and labour from the EU.

However, any of these possible factors and restrictions and outcomes relating to or arising as a result of the Brexit process
could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

LON54468925 30

**_The Group companies face potential secondary liabilities as members of the Heathrow Airport Holdings Group._**

The Group is part of the larger Heathrow Airport Holdings Group. The Group could, in certain circumstances, face
secondary liabilities in respect of obligations of other Heathrow Airport Holdings Group entities which could have a
material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_General risk of change of law._**

It is possible that changes in law, rules or regulations (including changes in tax regimes) applicable to the Group, or their
interpretation or application, either generally or following a change of UK government or an exit by the UK from the EU,
could result in the Group’s debt financing arrangements as originally structured no longer having the anticipated effect,
could increase the cost of the Group’s financing arrangements, could increase the Group’s tax liabilities, could result in
expropriation of some or all of Heathrow's assets and/or could adversely affect the rights, priorities of payments and/or
treatment of holdings in the Notes for Noteholders and could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group faces potential secondary (and joint and several) tax liabilities._**

Where a company fails to discharge certain tax liabilities within a specified time period, UK tax law imposes, in certain
circumstances, secondary liability for those overdue taxes on other companies that are or have been members of the same
group of companies, or are or have been under common control, for tax purposes with the company that has not discharged
its tax liabilities. With respect to VAT groupings, in certain circumstances members of the Group may also face joint and
several liability.

If any secondary (or joint and several) tax liabilities arise in the Issuer or other members of the Group, which are not
discharged by the other members of the wider Heathrow Airport Holdings Group, and are of significant amounts, the
Issuer or other members of the Group could be adversely affected.

**_UK insolvency law may impact the rights of creditors including the Noteholders in certain circumstances._**

The English insolvency statutes empower English courts to make an administration order in respect of an English
company. An administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that the relevant company is or is likely to become
“unable to pay its debts” and that the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. In
addition, the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” over the assets of an English company may appoint an administrator
out of court, provided such floating charge has become enforceable. In this case the prospective administrator must be
satisfied that the purpose of administration is reasonably likely to be achieved. An English company or the directors of
such company may also appoint an administrator out of court. The purpose of an administration comprises three parts
which must be looked at successively: rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable,
achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole or, if neither of those objectives are reasonably practicable,
and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realising property to make a distribution
to secured or preferred creditors.

The rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are particularly curtailed in an administration. Upon the appointment
of an administrator, no step may be taken to enforce security over the company’s property, except with the consent of the
administrator or leave of the court. The same requirements for consent or leave apply to the commencement or institution
of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress or diligence) against the company or property of the
company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for leave, in light of the
hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above.

Accordingly, if the Issuer was to enter into administration proceedings, the Notes and the related security from the Issuer
could not be enforced while the relevant company was in administration, without the leave of the court or consent of the
administrator. There can be no assurance that the security agent would obtain this leave of the court or consent of the
administrator.

In addition, an administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain requirements under the
Insolvency Act 1986, dispose of the property of a company in administration. However, the general prohibition against
enforcement by secured creditors without consent of the administrator or leave of the Court, and the administrators’
powers with respect to floating and other security, do not apply to any security interest created or arising under a financial
collateral arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Agreements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (UK). A
financial collateral arrangement includes (subject to certain other conditions) a pledge over shares in a company, where
both the collateral provider and collateral taker are non-natural persons.

Under English insolvency law, the liquidator or administrator of a company may, among other things, apply to the court to
unwind a transaction entered into by such company, if such company was unable to pay its debts (as defined in section 123
of the Insolvency Act 1986) at the time of, or as a result of, the transaction and enters into liquidation or administration
proceedings within two years of the completion of the transaction. A transaction might be subject to a challenge if it was

LON54468925 31


-----

entered into by a company at an undervalue, that is, it involved a gift by the company or the company received
consideration of less value than the benefit given by such company. However, a court generally will not intervene if a
company entered into the transaction in good faith for the purpose of carrying on its business and at the time it did so there
were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit such company. The Issuer believes that the Notes will
not be issued on terms which would amount to a transaction at an undervalue, that the offering is in good faith for the
purposes of carrying on the Group’s business and that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction will
benefit the Group. However, there can be no assurance that the issuance of the Notes will not be challenged by a liquidator
or administrator or that a court would support this analysis.

In addition, if it can be shown that a transaction entered into by an English company was made for less than fair value and
was made to shield assets from creditors, then the transaction may be set aside as a transaction defrauding creditors. Any
person who is a “victim” of the transaction, and not just liquidators or administrators, may assert such a claim. There is no
statutory time limit within which a claim must be made and the company need not be insolvent at the time of the
transaction.

If the Issuer was to commence administration proceedings, the Notes and the related security could not be enforced while
the relevant company was in administration.

The holder of a qualifying floating charge that has been created since 15 September 2003 over all or substantially all of the
assets of an English company can generally no longer appoint an administrative receiver of that company. There is,
however, an exception to this rule that applies to certain capital markets transactions that are expected to incur at least £50
million of debt.

Any interest accruing under or in respect of the Notes for any period from the date of commencement of administration or
liquidation proceedings, to the extent not fully covered by the assets securing the Notes, could be recovered by holders of
the Notes only from any surplus remaining after payment of all other debts provided in the proceeding and interest accrued
but unpaid up to the date of the commencement of the proceeding.

Under English insolvency law, certain preferential claims, including unpaid contributions to occupational pension schemes
in respect of the twelve-month period prior to insolvency and unpaid employees’ remuneration in respect of the fourmonth period prior to insolvency, will, while ranking behind the claims of holders of fixed security, rank ahead of floating
charges. In addition, a prescribed part of floating charge realisations (being 50 per cent. of the first £10,000 of net
realisations and 20 per cent. of the net realisations thereafter, up to a maximum of £600,000) is required to be set aside for
the benefit of unsecured creditors and, as such, ranks ahead of the relevant floating charge.

**RISKS RELATING TO THE ISSUER AND THE NOTES**

**_The Issuer depends on subsidiaries for payments._**

The Issuer is a holding company with no material assets other than the shares of its subsidiary, Heathrow (SP) Limited. All
of the Issuer’s revenue is generated by the Operating Companies. Accordingly, almost all of the Issuer’s cash flow is
generated by the Operating Companies. Therefore, the Issuer’s ability to make payments on its indebtedness and to fund
its other obligations is dependent not only on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate cash, but also on the ability of its
subsidiaries to distribute cash to it in the form of dividends, fees, interest, loans or otherwise.

However, the Issuer’s subsidiaries face various restrictions in their ability to distribute cash to the Issuer. The Senior
Borrower Group must satisfy certain restricted payment covenants and other conditions before it may make distributions to
the Issuer. Business performance and local accounting and tax rules may limit the amount of retained earnings, which is in
many cases the basis of dividend payments.

**_The Notes are subordinated to liabilities of the Issuer’s subsidiaries._**

The Issuer’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any
amounts due pursuant to any debt incurred by the Issuer or to make any funds available whether by dividends, fees, loans
or other payments. Any right of the Issuer to receive any assets of any of its subsidiaries upon liquidation, dissolution,
winding up, receivership, reorganisation, assignment for the benefit of creditors, marshalling of assets and liabilities or any
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings (and the consequent right of the holders of the Issuer’s indebtedness to
participate in the distribution of, or to realise proceeds from, those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of
any such subsidiary’s creditors (including trade creditors and holders of debt issued by such subsidiary). Accordingly, the
Notes will be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the Issuer’s subsidiaries. As at 30 June 2019, the Issuer’s
subsidiaries had £19,308 million of outstanding liabilities, including outstanding indebtedness. The terms and conditions
of the Notes do not prohibit the Issuer’s subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness.

LON54468925 32


-----

**_The Issuer may not be able to repurchase Notes on change of control._**

Upon a Change of Control (as defined under “Terms and Conditions of the Notes in Definitive Form—Definitions”), the
Issuer will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at 101 per cent. of their principal amount plus accrued
and unpaid interest. The source of funds for any such purchase of the Notes will be the Issuer’s available cash or cash
generated from the Operating Companies’ operations or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of
equity. The Issuer may not be able to satisfy its obligations to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control because it
may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the Notes that are tendered upon a change of control.

**_Liquidity of the Notes could be limited and there could be an absence of a secondary market for the Notes._**

There can be no assurance that a secondary market for the Notes will develop or, if a secondary market does develop for
any of the Notes issued after the date of this Prospectus, that it will provide any holder of Notes with liquidity or that any
such liquidity will continue for the life of the Notes. Consequently, any purchaser of the Notes must be prepared to hold
such Notes for an indefinite period of time or until final redemption or maturity of the Notes.

The liquidity and market value at any time of the Notes are affected by, among other things, the market view of the credit
risk of such Notes and will generally fluctuate with general interest rate fluctuations, general economic conditions, the
condition of certain financial markets, international political events and the performance and financial condition of the
Group.

**_Rating of the Notes_**

The ratings assigned by the rating agencies to the Notes reflect only the views of the rating agencies and in assigning the
ratings the rating agencies take into consideration the credit quality of the Group and structural features and other aspects
of the transaction, including counterparty risk. There is no assurance that any such ratings will continue for any period of
time or that they will not be reviewed, revised, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies as a result of
changes in, or unavailability of, information or if, in the rating agencies’ judgment, circumstances so warrant. If any rating
assigned to the Notes is lowered or withdrawn, the market value of the Notes may be reduced. Future events, including
events affecting the Group and/or circumstances relating to the airport industry generally, could have an adverse impact on
the ratings of the Notes.

**_Compliance with covenants may be affected by events beyond the Issuer’s control._**

The terms and conditions of the Notes, the 2024 Notes, the 2025 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 2030 PP and the Issuer
Facilities limit the Group’s ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends or make other
distributions; make investments; sell assets; enter into agreements restricting the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay
dividends; consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Group’s assets; enter into sale and
leaseback transactions; and provide security. In addition, the terms and conditions of the Notes require that, subject to
certain cure rights, Group RAR may not be greater than 92.5 per cent. as at any Relevant Testing Date. The terms and
conditions of the Notes, the 2024 Notes, the 2025 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 2030 PP and the Issuer Facilities also require
that Group ICR may not be less than 1.0 in respect of any Relevant Testing Period.

The ability of the Issuer to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond the Issuer’s
control. If the Issuer breaches any of these covenants or restrictions, it could be in default under the Notes, the 2024 Notes,
the 2025 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 2030 PP and the Issuer Facilities. This would permit the lenders under the Issuer
Facilities and the 2030 PP to take certain actions, including declaring all amounts that the Issuer has borrowed under the
Issuer Facilities or the 2030 PP, as the case may be and other indebtedness to be due and payable, together with accrued
and unpaid interest. This would also result in an event of default under the Notes, the 2024 Notes, the 2025 Notes and the
2027 Notes. The lenders could also refuse to extend further credit under the Issuer Facilities. If the debt under the Issuer
Facilities, the Notes, the 2024 Notes, the 2025 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 2030 PP or any other material financing
arrangement that the Issuer enters into were to be accelerated, the Issuer’s assets may be insufficient to repay in full the
Notes and the Issuer’s other indebtedness.

**_The interests of the Group’s ultimate shareholders may be inconsistent with interests of Noteholders._**

Ferrovial S.A., Qatar Holding LLC, Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, the Government of Singapore Investment
Corporation, Alinda Capital Partners, China Investment Corporation and Universities Superannuation Scheme, or
investment vehicles controlled or managed on their behalf, indirectly own all of the shares of the Issuer. As a result, these
shareholders have, directly or indirectly, the power, among other things, to affect the Group’s legal and capital structure
and its day-to-day operations, as well as the ability to elect and change management and to approve other changes to the
Group’s operations. The interests of the Group’s ultimate shareholders could conflict with the interests of investors in the
Notes, particularly if the Group encounters financial difficulties or is unable to pay its debts when due. In addition, the
Group’s ultimate shareholders may, in the future, own businesses that directly compete with the Group in certain respects,
or do business with the group.

LON54468925 33


-----

**_Security may be insufficient to repay the Notes._**

If there is an event of default under the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be secured only by the property and assets of
Heathrow (DSH) Limited and the Issuer, which primarily consist of the share capital of the Issuer held by Heathrow
(DSH) Limited and of the share capital of Heathrow (SP) Limited held by the Issuer. To the extent that the claims of the
holders of the Notes, the claims of lenders under the Issuer Facilities, the claims of the lenders under the 2030 PP and the
claims of any other third party creditor that shares in the Transaction Security in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement exceed the value of the Transaction Security securing the Notes and other obligations, those
claims will rank equally with the claims of the holders of all other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness
ranking pari passu with the Notes.

To the extent that other first-priority security interests, pre-existing liens, liens permitted under the terms and conditions of
the Notes and other rights encumber the Transaction Security securing the Notes, those parties may have or may exercise
rights and remedies with respect to the Transaction Security that could adversely affect the value of the security and the
ability of the security agent to realise or foreclose on the security.

**_Payments in relation to the Notes are subject to the Intercreditor Agreement._**

The Trustee will accede to an intercreditor agreement with, among others, the agents and representatives of the other
indebtedness secured by the Transaction Security, including the Issuer Facilities, the 2024 Notes, the 2025 Notes, the 2027
Notes, the 2030 PP and counterparties to certain hedging obligations. Other creditors may become parties to the
Intercreditor Agreement in the future and share in the Transaction Security. Among other things, the Intercreditor
Agreement governs the enforcement of the security documents, the sharing in any recoveries from such enforcement and
the release of the Transaction Security by the security agent.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the security agent shall act upon the instructions of the secured creditors
representing more than 50 per cent. of the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2024 Notes, the 2025 Notes,
the Notes, the 2027 Notes, any additional notes, the Issuer Facilities, the 2030 PP, any new credit facilities and certain
hedging creditors. As the Notes, when issued, will represent less than 50 per cent. of such amount (including the aggregate
Principal Amount of the Notes themselves), the holders of the Notes may be bound by instructions given by other secured
creditors. The Intercreditor Agreement further provides that, if the Trustee or holders of the Notes do not respond to a
Request (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) within 20 business days, the votes of holders of the Notes will not be
counted for, amongst other things, the purposes of instructing the security agent. These arrangements could be
disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes in a number of respects. For example, other creditors not subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement could commence enforcement action against the Issuer or its subsidiaries during such consultation
period, the Issuer or one or more of its subsidiaries could seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, or the value of
certain collateral could otherwise be impaired or reduced.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the security agent may release certain collateral in connection with sales of
assets pursuant to a permitted disposal or enforcement sale and in other circumstances permitted by the Trust Deed and the
Issuer Facilities. Therefore, such collateral available to secure the Notes could be reduced in connection with the sales of
assets or otherwise, subject to the requirements of the financing documents and the Trust Deed.

The Trust Deed, the terms of the 2025 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 2030 PP and the Issuer Facilities permit the Issuer, in
compliance with the covenants in those agreements, to incur additional indebtedness secured by liens on the Transaction
Security. The Issuer’s ability to incur additional debt in the future secured on the collateral may have the effect of diluting
the ratio of the value of such Transaction Security to the aggregate amount of the obligations secured by the Transaction
Security.

**_Book-entry form of Notes._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global form and deposited with a common depositary for Euroclear and
Clearstream, Luxembourg. Interests in the Notes will trade in book-entry form only. The common depositary, or its
nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg will be the sole holder of the Global Notes representing the Notes.
Accordingly, owners of book-entry interests must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, and
non-participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg must rely on the procedures of the participant through which
they own their interests, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of Notes.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon the
Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. The procedures to be
implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights
under the Notes.

LON54468925 34


-----

**_Modification, waivers and substitution._**

The terms and conditions of the Notes contain provisions for calling meetings of holders of the Notes to consider matters
affecting their interests generally. These provisions permit defined majorities to bind all holders of the Notes including
holders of the Notes who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting and holders of the Notes who voted in a manner
contrary to the majority.

The terms and condition of the Notes also provide that the Trustee may, without the consent of holders of the Notes, agree
to (i) any modification of, or to the waiver or authorisation of any breach or proposed breach of, any of the provisions of
the Notes or the Trust Deed, (ii) determine without the consent of the holders of the Notes that any event of default or
potential event of default shall not be treated as such or (iii) the substitution in place of the Issuer in respect of the Notes of
a new group holding company, in each case in the circumstances and subject to the conditions described in “Terms and
_Conditions of the Notes in Definitive Form”._

**INDUSTRY SOURCES AND TERMINOLOGY**

This Prospectus contains certain statistical and other information regarding Heathrow Airport and the markets it serves.

Unless otherwise indicated, the information contained in this Prospectus relating to Heathrow Airport’s market share
and the size of the relevant market sector is based on Heathrow’s own internal estimates based on regulatory and analyst
reports, special surveys and information published or provided by airlines and other companies, as well as Heathrow’s
own knowledge of the market.

References in this Prospectus to Heathrow Airport’s number of “passengers” refer to the sum of all arriving and
departing passengers, other than in-transit passengers.

Information in this Prospectus relating to Heathrow Airport’s percentage of “international” passengers is based on the
number of its passengers arriving from and departing to destinations that are not in the United Kingdom relative to the
total number of passengers served by Heathrow Airport. Information in this Prospectus relating to Heathrow Airport’s
percentage of “domestic” passengers is based on the number of its passengers arriving from and departing to
destinations that are in the United Kingdom relative to the total number of passengers served by Heathrow Airport.
Accordingly, the information reflects the place of origin or destination of passengers as opposed to their residence.

All information in this Prospectus relating to Heathrow Airport’s percentage of “business” passengers is based on the
number of Heathrow Airport’s passengers who are travelling for reasons related to such passengers’ employment, based
on surveyed information, relative to the total number of passengers served by Heathrow Airport. All information
relating to Heathrow Airport’s percentage of “leisure” passengers is based on the number of Heathrow Airport’s
passengers who are not business passengers, relative to the total number of passengers served by Heathrow Airport.

“ATM” or “Air Transport Movement” means a flight carried out for commercial purposes and includes scheduled
flights operating according to a published timetable, charter flights and all-cargo flights. Air transport movement does
not include empty positioning flights and private non-commercial flights.

“European **flights” are flights arriving from or departing to other destinations in Europe (other than domestic flights).**
International “long haul” flights are all flights other than European flights and domestic flights.

“Gate room” refers to the area where passengers board and disembark from their aircraft.

“hub airport” refers to an airport where a significant proportion of passengers transfer between flights in being
transported to their final destination.

“IATA” refers to the International Air Transport Association, a trade association of the world’s airlines which supports
the aviation sector with global standards for airline safety, security, efficiency and sustainability.

“Maximum allowable yield” refers to the maximum amount of aeronautical income per passenger that Heathrow may
charge in each regulatory year for services subject to price regulation by the CAA.

“Origin and destination” traffic refers to any traffic that is not transfer or transit traffic and originates from or
terminates at a particular airport.

“Pier” refers to an airport passenger building which is connected to a terminal and which houses Gate rooms where
passengers wait to board and disembark from their aircraft.

“Satellite” refers to an airport passenger building which is connected to a terminal and which houses not only Gate
rooms but also other passenger handling facilities (for example, retail facilities) and serves as an extension to the
departure lounge.

“Stand” means an aircraft parking stand; these can be ‘pier-served’, which means they are adjacent to the terminal,
enabling passengers to walk directly on and off aircraft parked on the stand via an airbridge, or they can be ‘remote’,
which requires passengers to either be transported by coach or walk between the stand and the terminal.

“Transfer traffic” relates to passengers who use an airport for the sole purpose of connecting from one aircraft to
another. They are counted as both arriving and departing passengers.

“Transit” or “In-transit” traffic refers to passengers who arrive and depart on the same aircraft within 24 hours.

References to the “Heathrow Express rail service” refer to the express (non-stop) service which runs between
Paddington station and Heathrow airport. Where reference is made to CAA publications or data, efforts have been made
to ensure data is reproduced and presented in a similar style to aid comparison and cross-reference but may not be
identical as a result of modifications made for presentational purposes.

**BUSINESS**

**Heathrow Airport**

London is the world’s leading global financial centre and a leading worldwide centre of commerce. As London’s largest
airport, and its only international hub, Heathrow Airport is a critical infrastructure asset not only for the UK but for
global finance and commerce.

Heathrow Airport hosts most of the world’s major international airlines and is the worldwide hub of British Airways
and the main European hub of the oneworld airline alliance. It also hosts the other two principal airline alliances of
SkyTeam and Star Alliance.

Heathrow Airport is served by two parallel runways which together have maximum permitted ATMs of 480,000 per
year. In 2018, Heathrow Airport operated at 99.1 per cent. of this limit in 2018 and has been operating close to the limit
for many years.

Heathrow Airport provides a wide range of passenger services, including passenger-handling facilities, car parking,
shops, bars and restaurants. Heathrow Airport is served by extensive bus services, London Underground services and
the dedicated Heathrow Express rail service to and from London Paddington Station.

The Group has invested approximately £9 billion transforming Heathrow Airport over the last decade, including the
opening of Terminal 2: The Queen’s Terminal in June 2014. Each of Heathrow Airport’s four operational terminals is
either new or recently refurbished. In 2018, the Group invested £793 million (2017: £700 million). In 2018, Terminal 2
handled 18.5 million passengers (2017: 17.8 million) and Terminal 5 handled 32.8 million passengers (2017: 32.3
million).

Terminal 5 has been awarded the World’s Best Airport Terminal by Skytrax for five consecutive years up to and
including 2016 and Terminal 2 was awarded the World’s Best Airport Terminal by Skytrax in 2018. In 2019, Terminal
5 regained the title as the World’s Best Airport Terminal. Heathrow Airport was named “Best Airport in Western
Europe” by Skytrax for the fifth time in 2019. In 2019, Heathrow Airport also received the award for Best Airport
Shopping for the tenth consecutive year.

Heathrow has continued to achieve strong recognition from passengers for overall service. In the independent Airport
Service Quality ("ASQ") survey conducted by Airports Council International ("ACI"), Heathrow achieved an ASQ
score of 4.16 out of 5.00 in the first nine months of 2019 compared to 4.16 in the first nine months of 2018 and just 3.96
in the first nine months of 2012. This result upholds Heathrow’s position in the top European quartile despite pressures
from record passenger growth and operational disruptions. In addition, in the first nine months of 2019, 82 per cent. of
passengers surveyed rated their Heathrow Airport experience ‘Excellent’ or ‘Very good’, illustrating the strength and
resilience of Heathrow's operation and the benefits of our continued investments.

This result is underpinned by a strong overall operational performance, strong levels of punctuality and high levels of
customer satisfaction across several key service attributes including waiting time at security, cleanliness, wayfinding,
airport staff helpfulness and connections. Its status as one of the best hub airports worldwide was further endorsed by
OAG (an air travel data network) which named Heathrow Airport as the Number 1 ‘most internationally connected
airport in the world’ for 2018.

**REVENUE GENERATION AND ECONOMIC REGULATION**

**Overview**

Heathrow Airport is subject to economic regulation by the CAA. The regulatory system is designed to allow airports to
generate revenues which are sufficient to finance their operating and capital expenditure requirements and provide a
regulated rate of return on their RAB. Among other things, the CAA sets the maximum level of airport charges that
Heathrow can levy on airlines for using Heathrow Airport’s facilities. These price caps take into account Heathrow’s
forecast revenues (both aeronautical and non-aeronautical) and costs as well as allowing recovery of capital costs and a
return on capital. Details of the regulatory regime and how the CAA determines price caps are set out in “Airport
_Regulation”._

Heathrow generates two primary types of income: aeronautical income, which is generated from fees charged to airlines
for use of the airport’s facilities, and non-aeronautical income from a variety of sources. The chart below shows the
breakdown of the £2,970 million total revenue of Heathrow by source for 2018.

###### Other, 17%

 Aeronautical,
 Retail, 24% 59%

**Aeronautical income**

Aeronautical income reflects the charges levied by Heathrow on the airport’s airline customers. These charges (tariffs)
cannot exceed the regulated maximum allowable yield per passenger.

The tariff structure through which the aeronautical income is recovered from airlines includes three key elements:

_Departing passenger fees_

   - Fees per passenger are based on the number of passengers on board an aircraft and are levied in respect of all
departing passengers. There is no charge in respect of crew members working on flights.

   - Three levels of charge based on route area: domestic, European and rest of world. Transfer and transit
passengers benefit from a discount.

   - Airlines are entitled to receive remote stand rebates which applies per passenger for scheduled flights arriving
or departing from a stand which has been designated as remote by Heathrow.

   - Departing flights are subject to a minimum departure charge which applies when the calculated departing
passenger charge falls below this minimum level.

_Landing charges_

   - Landing charges are levied for substantially all aircraft (with certain diplomatic and other flights being
exempted). These are calculated in accordance with the certified maximum take-off weight of the aircraft and
are banded into categories for aircraft weighing less than and those weighing more than sixteen metric tonnes,
which includes nearly all commercial aircraft. These charges are broken into further categories based on the

LON54468925 48


-----

noise rating of each aircraft with quieter aircrafts attracting a lower charge. Arriving aircrafts are also subject
to emissions charge based on their NOx rating.

_Parking charges_

   - Aircraft parking charges are levied for each 15-minute slot after 30 minutes for narrow-bodied aircraft and 90
minutes for wide-bodied aircraft.

The CAA stipulates that the airport must charge non-passenger flights at the same rates as passenger flights. These
flights also incur the minimum departure charge.

Heathrow Airport hosts most of the world’s major international airlines and is the worldwide hub of British Airways
and the main European hub of the oneworld airline alliance. It also hosts the other two principal airline alliances of
SkyTeam and Star Alliance.

The chart below represents the total aeronautical income[(1)] for Heathrow Airport by airline for 2018:

Aer Lingus, 2% Air Canada, 3%

American Airlines, 4%

Other, 34%

British Airways, 42%

Virgin Atlantic, 5%

United Airlines, 4%

Qatar Airways, 2%

Delta Air Lines, 2%
Emirates, 3%

(1) Rounded to the nearest per cent. and excludes other charges, related primarily to the provision of fixed electrical ground power and preconditioned air to aircraft.

**_Non-aeronautical income_**

Heathrow generates non-aeronautical income from a variety of sources. These include:

   - concession fees from retail operators;

   - direct income from car parks, advertising revenue and VIP products;

   - the rental of airport premises such as aircraft hangars, warehouses, cargo storage facilities, maintenance
facilities, offices and airline lounges;

   - the provision of facilities such as baggage handling and passenger check-in; and

   - fare revenue from the operation of the Heathrow Express rail service.

**THE GROUP AND ITS OWNERSHIP**

The Group is indirectly owned by investment vehicles controlled or managed by Ferrovial S.A. (25.00 per cent.), Qatar
Holding LLC (20.00 per cent.), Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (12.62 per cent.), the Government of Singapore
Investment Corporation (11.20 per cent.), Alinda Capital Partners (11.18 per cent.), China Investment Corporation
(10.00 per cent.) and Universities Superannuation Scheme (10.00 per cent.). The Group companies are indirect
subsidiaries of LHR Airports. LHR Airports is itself a subsidiary of Heathrow Airport Holdings.

**KEY STRENGTHS**

**Heathrow Airport has a strong position in the South East of England, one of the world’s busiest air traffic**
**markets and a market with growing demand for air travel.**

   - Airports are critical to domestic and international travel, trade and communication. London, as the world’s
leading financial and commercial centre, drives significant global business travel into and out of the region.

   - Demand to fly to and from London is 27 per cent. higher than any other city in the world (Source: Airports IS
data December 2018).

   - As London’s largest airport, and its only international hub, Heathrow Airport is a critical infrastructure asset
not only for the UK but for global finance and commerce.

   - Aviation has demonstrated resilience as a long-term growth industry. Over the period of 2008 to 2018,
passenger traffic through Heathrow Airport increased at a compound annual rate of 1.8 per cent. despite the
effects of the major economic downturn in 2008 and 2009. Growth in air travel in the South East of England is
expected to continue. Heathrow Airport accounts for nearly half of total passenger traffic in Greater London,
with passenger traffic through the five major airports in the Greater London area at over 176 million
passengers in 2018 (Source: IATA Airport IS traffic data for 2018).

   - The scale of infrastructure and geographical requirements necessary to develop a competing airport provide for
very high barriers to entry. These barriers to entry are even more marked for hub airports such as Heathrow
Airport.

**Heathrow Airport has a unique scale, market position and resilience in passenger traffic.**

   - In 2018, Heathrow Airport was Europe’s busiest airport and the world’s seventh busiest in terms of total
passengers (Source: ACI Dec 2018).

   - Heathrow Airport enjoys a unique market position in the UK, being the country’s only hub airport and acting
as the gateway to approximately 70 per cent. (in terms of seats) of all the UK’s scheduled long-haul air traffic
(Source: IATA Airport IS schedules for 2018).

   - Heathrow Airport is the largest UK port by value with 1.7 million tonnes of cargo passing through it in 2018.
Heathrow plays a critical role in the UK’s international trade, handling over 30 per cent. of all UK exports by
value outside the European Union in 2018 (Source: UK Trade Info).

   - Over half of passengers traveling through Heathrow Airport are non-UK resident and it has an even split
between business, visiting friends and family and leisure traffic. Further, it has a balanced mix of European,
North American and other long-haul traffic. As a result, there is a greater diversity of economic and
demographic factors affecting the airport’s passenger demand compared to other UK and international airports.

   - A substantial proportion of Heathrow Airport’s passenger traffic is long-haul, with 108 long-haul destinations
currently served from Heathrow Airport, which makes Heathrow Airport one of only four airports globally
with more than 100 direct long-haul routes. In 2018, Heathrow Airport’s proportion of long-haul traffic was
51.6 per cent. (in terms of passengers). There are 82 airlines currently operating at Heathrow Airport and over
two thirds of those operate long-haul services. Heathrow Airport has also been operating close to its permitted
capacity for a number of years, reflecting airline demand to use the airport.

**Regulation provides cash flow visibility and mitigates market risk.**

   - The price caps set by the CAA take into account forecast passenger traffic, operating costs and other revenues
for Heathrow as well as allowing recovery of capital costs and a return on capital. In making its determination,
the CAA takes into account the actual historic experience of Heathrow and it is limited to a pre-defined
timeframe (generally five years) which materially mitigates the market risk faced by Heathrow. This pricesetting mechanism provides significant income predictability and cash flow visibility within each regulatory
period as well as protection against longer term cost and revenue risks.

**Proven resilience to market trends, shocks and economic downturns.**

   - Heathrow has been resilient to economic downturns and other changes in the air travel market such as wars,
acts of terrorism and the threat of pandemic illnesses. In recent years, demand for air travel in the UK has
tended to return relatively quickly to historic levels following external shocks.

LON54468925 50


-----

**Heathrow has consistently demonstrated operational excellence**

   - In 2018, Heathrow continued to deliver strong levels of service across the end to end journey. Over the period,
Heathrow's service standards remained high, with limited or no disruption to its operations despite passenger
growth increasing pressure on key processes such as check in, security, immigration and baggage. Evidenced
by customer feedback as well as a series of industry awards that Heathrow received in 2018, over the years
Heathrow has transformed customer experience at the airport. In the independent Airport Service Quality
("ASQ") survey conducted by Airports Council International ("ACI"), Heathrow achieved an Airport Service
Quality score of 4.16 out of 5.00 in the first nine months of 2019 compared to 4.16 in the first nine months of
2018 and just 3.96 in the first nine months of 2012. This result upholds Heathrow’s position in the top
European quartile despite pressures from record passenger growth and operational disruptions. In addition, in
the first nine months of 2019, 82 per cent. of passengers surveyed rated their Heathrow Airport experience
‘Excellent’ or ‘Very good’, illustrating the strength and resilience of Heathrow's operation and the benefits of
our continued investments.

   - Heathrow Airport's status as one of the best hub airports worldwide was further endorsed by OAG (an air
travel data network) which named Heathrow Airport as the Number 1 ‘most internationally connected airport
in the world’ for 2018.

**Heathrow benefits from diversified income sources and serves a variety of market segments.**

   - Heathrow earns income from a variety of sources, including charges to airlines, concession fees from retail
operators, income from car parks, advertising revenue, the rental of airport premises such as aircraft hangars,
cargo storage facilities, maintenance facilities and offices, the provision of facilities and services such as
baggage handling and passenger check-in and the Heathrow Express rail service.

   - Heathrow Airport serves a diversified range of major airlines. It is home to British Airways and Virgin
Atlantic Airways and also sizeable operations for many non-UK airlines, particularly from Europe, North
America, the Middle East and Asia.

   - Heathrow Airport serves a range of market segments, including business and leisure travellers, origin and
destination and transfer passengers and long and short-haul routes.

**Sustainable growth**

   - Heathrow has taken a leading approach to sustainably grow the airport via the Heathrow 2.0 strategy which, in
Heathrow's view, reduces long-term growth risk. Heathrow believes that it is important to use its strong
position to drive change in the global aviation industry. This builds trust with local, political and NGO
stakeholders and supports its licence to grow. Sustainability is also important in attracting talent to work at
Heathrow and creates a brand preference for passengers to choose to fly via Heathrow Airport instead of
elsewhere. Finally, sustainability helps Heathrow to reduce costs by reducing waste.

**Robust debt financing platform**

  - The Group’s debt financing documents provide creditors with a strong set of protections. This includes
security over all of the Group’s assets, dividend trigger events, financial and operating covenants and a strong
set of information and reporting requirements. See "Description of Other Indebtedness ".

**THE ROLE OF HEATHROW**

Heathrow co-ordinates the activities of the numerous organisations involved in the provision of airport services to
passengers, airlines and other airport users which include:

   - providing passengers, airlines and other service providers with the infrastructure and facilities (such as checkin desks, concourses, gate rooms, baggage handling facilities and office facilities) needed to optimise
operations and maximise passenger and flight traffic within existing capacity constraints;

   - implementing, under government supervision, air transport security measures, including passenger and
baggage inspections. The UK Government has the power to give any airport operator “such directions of a
general character as appear to the Secretary of State to be necessary or expedient in the interests of national
security or of relations with a country or territory outside the UK”;

   - developing commercial areas (such as shops, restaurants and car parks) and determining the optimal mix and
location of retail services;

   - maintaining and developing airport infrastructure to meet evolving airline and passenger demands;

LON54468925 51


-----

ensuring that Heathrow Airport is served by appropriate and adequate ground transport services;

   - maximising capacity at Heathrow Airport and setting airport capacity constraints in consultation with NATS,
the airlines and ACL (which allocates take-off and landing slots); and

   - assigning airlines to terminals in consultation with the airlines, ACL and NATS.

**HEATHROW AIRPORT’S INFRASTRUCTURE, FACILITIES AND ACCESS**

**Overview**

Heathrow Airport commenced operations as London’s principal commercial airport in 1946. The airport’s first
permanent terminal opened in 1955 and the substantial growth in demand for air transport throughout the 1960s and
1970s saw much of the core infrastructure at Heathrow Airport’s Central Terminal Area developed, including the
opening of what is now Terminal 3 in 1961 and Terminal 1 in 1968 and the construction of car parks, public transport
and other operational and administration facilities. Terminal 4 was added in 1986.

In 2008, Terminal 5 opened on the western side of the airport. The terminal has transformed passenger experience and
also operational performance. The main building and its Satellites are positioned perpendicular to the runways, to
maximise the efficient use of land on the airport, delivering operationally efficient taxiway and runway hold processes
for the benefit of the whole campus. As well as delivering passenger, airline and airport benefit in its own right, the
additional terminal capacity created by Terminal 5 provided the space to allow Heathrow to begin renovating and
rebuilding its other terminals. Terminal 5 was named the World’s Best Airport Terminal by Skytrax for five successive
years up to and including 2016 and regained the title of World’s Best Airport Terminal in 2019.

The first key phase in transforming Heathrow’s existing terminals was the construction of a new Terminal 2. The
original Terminal 2 was closed in late 2009 with demolition of the old terminal infrastructure enabling construction of
the new terminal to commence in mid-2010. In June 2014, the £2.5 billion investment was opened on time and on
budget and attained a high safety record during the construction phase.

The original Terminal 2, opened by Her Majesty the Queen in 1955 was Heathrow’s first permanent terminal and was
designed to deal with 1.2 million passengers a year. The new terminal has the capacity to cater for up to 20 million
passengers a year. Airlines and passengers benefit from state of the art facilities that include main terminal and satellite
buildings, a multi-storey short-stay car park and an energy centre supporting the Terminal 2 campus and the wider
airport. The terminal and satellite buildings include 24 aircraft stands of which 7 stands are capable of handling the
A380 aircraft operating at Heathrow Airport.

Terminal 2 is home to all 24 Star Alliance member airlines operating at Heathrow Airport together with Aer Lingus,
Eurowings, Icelandair and Flybe. For the Star Alliance airlines, it provides the opportunity to enhance efficiencies
through use of common facilities, processes and personnel. It also enhances the scope for closer commercial cooperation between alliance members by, for example, capitalising on competitive minimum connection times to attract
greater volumes of transfer passengers. Both these features will further strengthen Heathrow Airport’s competitive
position.

In parallel with the work on Heathrow Airport’s terminals, significant investment continues in Heathrow Airport’s
baggage infrastructure. This includes an underground automated baggage system between Terminal 3 and Terminal 5
and the Terminal 3 integrated baggage system which became fully operational in April 2016.

**Runways**

Heathrow Airport’s two parallel runways generally operate in “segregated mode”, with arriving aircraft allocated to one
runway and departing aircraft to the other. To mitigate noise impact to residents living below the approach and
departure routes, the allocation of runways to arriving and departing aircraft is normally swapped at around 3:00 p.m.
each day or as weather conditions necessitate.

The airport is permitted to schedule up to 480,000 ATMs per year and in 2018 Heathrow Airport operated at 99.1 per
cent. of this limit.

**Retail Facilities**

Heathrow Airport has a total of approximately 58,600 square metres of retail space served by over 83 retail clients
operating almost 480 retail outlets. Terminal 5, with over 16,900 square metres of retail space, has significantly
increased the airport’s overall retail portfolio. Heathrow Airport owns over 22,000 public car park spaces that are
available to passengers and the general public. All terminals at Heathrow Airport are served by car rental operators. The
terminals and their approaches provide advertising space, which yields further income.

LON54468925 52

**Access to Heathrow Airport**

Heathrow Airport’s extensive ground transport links facilitate access to the airport for passengers, cargo transporters
and airport personnel:

   - Heathrow Airport is located just off the M4 motorway, linking London and the West of England, and London’s
orbital motorway, the M25.

   - Heathrow Express offers a frequent non-stop rail service to and from London Paddington Station. This service
is supplemented by the TfL Rail “stopping service”, which provides local access to the airport as well as
connections with train services on the main rail line between London and the West of England.

   - Additional direct rail connections to Heathrow Airport will commence with the introduction of the Elizabeth
Line services between Central London and Heathrow Airport.

   - In addition, the UK Government has confirmed its support for a rail link between Heathrow Airport and the
west of England on the Great Western Main Line and work is progressing on the high-speed rail link between
London and Birmingham (with a connection to Heathrow Airport via Old Oak Common), currently scheduled
to be operational between 2026 and 2033 although subject to the Oakervee review which will report after the
General Election. In December 2018, the Department for Transport published their findings on the Market
Sounding exercise for private investment for a new southern rail link to Heathrow Airport and are currently
developing their strategic objectives for the scheme.

   - The London Underground Piccadilly Line has stations serving each of the terminals at Heathrow Airport.

   - Heathrow Airport has one of the busiest coach stations in the UK. Long distance coach services operated by
National Express provide fast services from Heathrow Airport to various parts of the UK, including Victoria
Coach Station in Central London. Many of the local bus services in the nearby London suburbs also run to the
airport.

**Capital investment at Heathrow Airport**

The capital investment programme at Heathrow Airport of approximately £9 billion over the last decade has
transformed Heathrow Airport’s infrastructure, positioning it strongly to continue its role as one of the leading global
hub airports for the benefit of the whole of the UK in the coming decades.

Capital expenditure for the Q6 regulatory period from 1 April 2014 to 31 December 2018 was £2.9 billion, or £3.1
billion including capital related to expansion. Capital expenditure for the initial one-year extension to the Q6 regulatory
period through to 31 December 2019 is currently forecast to be £627 million or around £953 million including capital
related to expansion. The proposed capital expenditure for iH7, the further two year extension of the Q6 regulatory
period through to 31 December 2021, is under review with the airline community and the CAA. The capital investment
plan is subject to approval of individual projects and the corresponding business cases. The capital programme is
primarily focused on maintenance and compliance related projects, together with sustaining and improving the
passenger experience.

|Compound Annual Growth Rate, 2008-2018||||1.8||||||0.1|


(1) Percentage growth on previous year and compound annual growth rate is based on unrounded passenger and ATM numbers.

Over the period from 2008 to 2018, traffic at Heathrow Airport increased by approximately 20 per cent. to over 80
million passengers in 2018, an annual compound rate of 1.8 per cent. Heathrow Airport has generally been operating
close to its limit of 480,000 Air Transport Movements per annum for the last 15 years, operating at 99.1 per cent. of its
limit in 2018.

As Heathrow Airport has been operating at close to 100 per cent. of its ATM cap, overall passenger growth at the
airport is generally dependent on factors such as larger aircraft, increases in the number of seats available for particular
types of aircraft and higher load factors. In the first nine months of 2019 average number of seats per aircraft remained
broadly in line with the first nine months of 2018 at 213.2 (2018: 213.4). Passenger traffic growth increased 0.7 per
cent. in the first nine months of 2019 to a record 61.0 million passengers.

At the same time that the number of seats per aircraft has been improving, load factors have also improved. A key
driver for the commercial aeronautical deal which Heathrow is aiming to implement in 2020 and 2021 is to create
incentives for airlines to continue to improve load factors. In the first nine months of 2019, load factors increased to
80.2 per cent. (2018 (79.8 per cent)) driven largely by the strong demand to fly to and from Heathrow Airport.

In the five years prior to 2012, prior to the recent period of more robust growth, Heathrow Airport’s traffic declined
modestly particularly reflecting the impact of the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009. Its passenger traffic declined
only 1.4 per cent. to 66.9 million in 2008 (from 2007) and 1.5 per cent. to 65.9 million in 2009 (from 2008) and saw a
cumulative reduction in rolling annual traffic from peak to trough in this period of 3.4 per cent. This was amongst the
most resilient performances of major airports in Europe and North America, thought to be influenced by three factors
namely Heathrow Airport operating at full capacity, its high exposure to long-haul traffic (the faster growing segment
of the global aviation market) and the countercyclical nature of transfer traffic.

Over the last ten years there has also been a shift in traffic at Heathrow Airport towards long-haul routes with long-haul
traffic increasing 21 per cent. from 34.1 million passengers in 2008 to 41.3 million passengers in 2018. European and
domestic UK traffic was just 19 per cent. higher at the end of this period with its share of Heathrow Airport’s total
traffic declining from 47.8 per cent. of total traffic in 2008 to 47.6 per cent. in 2018.

(1) Excludes other charges, related primarily to the provision of fixed electrical ground power and pre-conditioned air to aircraft.

(2) Includes Iberia departures operated by British Airways.

(3) Includes Lufthansa, Austrian Airlines, Swiss Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Germanwings and Eurowings.

The largest airline customer at Heathrow Airport is British Airways, which has its global hub there. British Airways is a
full-service airline operating a network of intercontinental, European and domestic services. British Airways operates to
all regions including key global cities. International Airlines Group owns British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus and
Vueling, which all operate at Heathrow Airport. Traffic from these airlines in 2018 totalled 40.8 million passengers
(2017: 40.3 million). British Airways and Iberia are currently the sole airline occupants at Terminal 5. Heathrow has an
agreed joint framework with British Airways for future cooperation.

The second largest airline customer at Heathrow Airport is Virgin Atlantic Airways which operates multi-class flights
to long-haul destinations from Heathrow Airport’s Terminal 3.

The joint business agreement between British Airways and American Airlines has provided American Airlines with
additional slots at the airport, allowing them to grow passenger volumes to 1.7 million passengers in 2018 and means
they are now the third largest airline at Heathrow.

Lufthansa Group owns Lufthansa, Austrian Airlines, Swiss Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Germanwings and Eurowings
which all operate at Heathrow Airport and traffic from these airlines in 2018 totalled 4.5 million passengers (2017: 4.3
million).

**Air Service Agreements and Open Skies**

The rights of airlines to operate to and from Heathrow Airport are subject to air service agreements between the UK and
other countries (which fall under the umbrella of the 1944 Convention on International Civil Aviation), and multilateral
agreements (such as the Open Skies agreement between the European Community, its Member States and the United
States which came into effect on 30 March 2008, and liberalised air services between the EU Member States and the
United States (the “Open Skies Agreement”), which permits any airline in the EU to fly to any point in the US and
vice-versa). As a result of these air service agreements, a greater number of airlines have access to Heathrow Airport.

The UK Government has concluded replacement Air Service Agreements (“ASAs”) for countries that are covered by its
membership of the EU, like the United States that maintain today’s arrangements.

**UK – EU air services in the event of no deal**

The EU’s Regulation 2019/502 on common rules ensuring basic air connectivity (‘the EU Regulation’) entered into
force in March 2019. This EU Regulation provides the basis for EU countries to give UK airlines permission to operate
if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. Subject to some minor modifications, it also applies to Norway and Iceland
through its incorporation into the EEA Agreement. The EU’s Regulation was originally intended to apply until the end
of March 2020, but a proposal to extend this to October 2020 was announced by the European Commission on 4
September 2019.

**OTHER OPERATIONS**

**Cargo and Mail Carriers**

Heathrow Airport handles cargo and mail traffic, although this only forms a small part of ATMs. The bulk of cargo and
mail at the airport is carried in the cargo holds of passenger flights rather than by dedicated cargo flights. There were
2,880 all-cargo ATMs at Heathrow Airport in 2018 (2017: 2,951).

Cargo and mail carriers are responsible for handling merchandise and packages at Heathrow Airport, including delivery
to cargo warehouses, customs procedures and clearance, aircraft loading and unloading, sorting and transport to the
final destination.

**ROLE OF GOVERNMENT SERVICES AND AGENCIES IN AIRPORT OPERATIONS**

The UK Government is responsible for a number of essential services at Heathrow Airport, which it discharges through
governmental and non-governmental agencies, notably:

  - security operations: The UK Government is responsible for setting aviation security regulations, issues
directions to airport operators, airlines and cargo operators and monitors compliance with these directions
through a programme of regular inspections and audits;

  - public order and policing services: Policing operations at Heathrow Airport are the responsibility of the
Metropolitan Police Authority which is paid to provide these services by Heathrow. These public safety
services should be distinguished from security operations, which are designed to prevent illicit acts that risk
endangering the security of aircraft and passengers; and

  - border controls: The UK Home Office’s Border Force is responsible for the control of persons and goods.

Air traffic control, including aerodrome navigation services, are provided by NATS, a privately held entity which is
responsible for the arrival and departure of aircraft to and from the aircraft parking areas at Heathrow Airport. NATS
also works closely with Heathrow and airlines in determining the declaration of scheduling capacity.

**SUPPLIERS**

The Heathrow Airport Holdings Group works with numerous external suppliers for the delivery of services relating to
the day-to-day operation of the airport, as well as for the construction of capital projects.

**Utilities**

The electrical power distribution infrastructure at Heathrow Airport is owned, managed, maintained and developed by
UK Power Networks Services Limited under a long-term contract. Arrangements are in place with E.ON for the supply
of electricity and gas, with Affinity Water for the supply of water and with Thames Water for sewerage and trade
effluent services.

**IT**

A majority of IT services for Heathrow Airport are currently outsourced by Heathrow to Computacenter (UK) Limited
and BAE Systems Applied Intelligence Limited, under contracts that commenced in 2017, and to Capgemini UK plc
under a contract that commenced in 2018. SITA Information Networking Computing BV provides certain network and
telecommunications services under a contract that commenced in 2018.

**Baggage**

Baggage system operation and maintenance services for Heathrow Airport are provided by Babcock Airports Limited
under a framework contract that commenced in 2013 and was extended in 2018. The IT for Heathrow Airport’s baggage
systems is provided by Vanderlande Industries UK Limited under a contract that commenced in 2018.

**Other services**

There are a large number of services required for the operation of Heathrow Airport which are arranged on a separate
basis with external suppliers, including security screening, ground handling, terminal cleaning and passenger
transportation services.

LON54468925 56


-----

**COMPETITION**

Heathrow Airport competes for Transfer traffic with the other major European hub airports such as Paris Charles de
Gaulle, Amsterdam Schiphol, Frankfurt and Madrid Barajas. The airport also faces increasing competition for Transfer
traffic from hub airports in the Middle East, such as Dubai, Istanbul and Doha.

To a more limited extent, there is some competition from London Gatwick Airport, London Stansted Airport, London
Luton Airport, London Southend Airport and London City Airport in the air travel market in the South East of England
and other forms of travel (including the Eurostar high-speed train service connecting London with Paris, Brussels and a
variety of other European cities).

**EXPANSION OF HEATHROW AIRPORT**

On 25 October 2016, the UK Government announced its decision to support the expansion of Heathrow Airport. The
UK Government’s decision followed the clear and unanimous recommendation of the Airports Commission on 1 July
2015, following nearly three years of consultation, evidence gathering and analysis. Heathrow has completed three
public consultations as Heathrow works to refine its preferred masterplan. Heathrow launched its statutory consultation
(the “June 2019 Consultation”) on 18 June 2019, which ran until 13 September 2019 and set out details on its
preferred proposals, inviting comments from the local community as well as statutory consultees and the wider public.
The preferred proposals include expansion of Heathrow Airport with the construction of a new runway north west of
Heathrow Airport (the “North West Runway”), related enabling infrastructure and new taxiway systems, additional
terminal capacity and satellite buildings, automated baggage facilities and passenger transit systems for ease of
movement around Heathrow Airport (together the “North West Runway Scheme”).

The North West Runway Scheme is expected to involve a significant programme of acquisition of residential and
commercial property in the area of land adjacent to the existing perimeter of Heathrow Airport, to be acquired to
develop much of the expected additional infrastructure and facilities required as part of the North West Runway
Scheme. Subject to obtaining a DCO (as set out below), the proposed expansion of Heathrow Airport is required by the
Airports National Policy Statement to deliver at least 260,000 additional flights per annum. Heathrow’s current draft
preferred masterplan considers growth up to 740,000 flights, serving approximately 142 million passengers per annum
compared to over 80 million passengers in 2018. If Heathrow is granted a DCO, the first flights are expected to begin
using the new runway as early as 2026.

The UK Government has made it clear that the expansion of Heathrow Airport will only be allowed to proceed on the
basis of Heathrow offering a “world class package of compensation and mitigation worth up to £2.6 billion, including
community support, insulation, and respite from noise” to balance expansion.

The June 2019 Consultation, also contained a preliminary assessment of the likely impacts of expansion on the
environment and local communities, together with Heathrow’s plans to manage such impacts. This includes proposals
for property compensation, a Noise Insulation Policy, a Community Fund and measures to mitigate against air pollution,
carbon and other environmental effects.

**National Policy Statement and Development Consent Order process**

The Planning Act 2008 (the “Planning Act”) sets out the consenting and authorisation process for nationally significant
infrastructure projects (“NSIPs”). NSIPs are projects considered by government to be so large and important that
permission to build them needs to be given at a national level, by the relevant Secretary of State. The construction or
alteration of an airport falls under the Planning Act regime where its proposed increase in passenger capacity would be
at least 10 million additional passengers per year. The proposed expansion of Heathrow Airport would exceed this
threshold and therefore it is classified as an NSIP under the Planning Act.

The Planning Act provides that the Secretary of State can designate national policy statements (“NPS”) which set out
the policy framework against which an application for development consent to construct and operate a NSIP will be
determined. NPSs are subject to public consultation and scrutiny by Parliament before being finalised. In February
2017, the UK Government published its draft Airports National Policy Statement (“ANPS”) outlining its policy for
Heathrow Airport’s expansion. The draft ANPS was subsequently updated to take into consideration the responses
received to the first consultation of the ANPS. Following a further public consultation on the ANPS and a review by the
Transport Select Committee, a final version of the ANPS was tabled for consideration by the UK Parliament.

The final ANPS was approved by the UK Parliament on 25 June 2018. The House of Commons voted 415 to 119 in
favour of the ANPS, a majority of 296. The Secretary of State for Transport formally designated the ANPS on 26 June
2018.

Under the Planning Act, any development defined as an NSIP will require consent in the form of a Development
Consent Order (“DCO”). Heathrow, as promoter of the proposed expansion, will therefore need to apply for a DCO to
the Secretary of State for Transport. A DCO is legislation that combines consent to develop a project alongside a range

LON54468925 57


-----

of other consents that would normally have to be obtained separately, such as listed building consent and environmental
consents. A DCO can also contain powers for the compulsory acquisition of land and development that is associated
with the NSIP but not part of it.

Pre-application consultation is a key part of the planning process under the Planning Act. Heathrow is required to
formally consult interested parties, including the public, local authorities and other statutory consultees, such as Natural
England, Historic England and the Environment Agency before making its application.

The DCO application must be submitted to the Planning Inspectorate, the government agency responsible for operating
the planning process for NSIPs, who will process the application on behalf of the Secretary of State. The Planning
Inspectorate will publicly examine the application and make a recommendation to the Secretary of State, who will then
make a final decision on whether to grant the DCO. Once a decision has been issued by the relevant Secretary of State,
there is a six-week judicial review period in which an application to challenge it in the High Court on legal grounds may
be submitted.

The DCO will not include consent to make the necessary changes to the airspace and flight paths serving Heathrow
Airport as a result of expansion. This is authorised by the CAA via a separate airspace change process under CAP1616.
The final application for airspace change consent is expected to be submitted after the DCO has been granted.

**Draft preferred masterplan development**

Since approval of the ANPS, Heathrow has been actively developing its DCO application and has made considerable
progress towards delivering a sustainable, affordable and financeable expanded Heathrow Airport. Heathrow remains
committed to delivering expansion responsibly through open and transparent consultation. Heathrow has carried out
three public consultations. Between January and March 2018, Heathrow consulted on its emerging proposals and
options for the expansion of the airport. Between January and March 2019, Heathrow carried out a second consultation,
which focused on airspace change proposals for its existing two runways and expansions as well as future operations for
an expanded airport.

Heathrow launched the June 2019 Consultation on 18 June 2019 and it ran until 13 September 2019. Statutory
consultation is required under the Planning Act prior to submission of a DCO application. Heathrow has assessed all
feedback received to date through its previous consultations to develop its proposals and is currently assessing the
feedback from the June 2019 Consultation. Heathrow will use the feedback received via this statutory consultation, and
any further engagement after this date, to finalise the project prior to submission of its DCO application in 2020.

The June 2019 Consultation sought feedback on a number of proposals including:

   - **Heathrow’s draft preferred masterplan for expansion:** Heathrow's proposals for the future layout of the
airport including the runway and other airport infrastructure such as terminals and road access;

   - **plans to operate the future airport: how the future three runway airport will be operated, including important**
elements such as night flights, as well as how additional flights could be operated on Heathrow Airport’s
existing two runways before the new runway opens;

   - **assessment of impacts of Heathrow Airport’s growth:** Heathrow’s preliminary assessment of the likely
impacts of expansion on the environment and local communities; and

   - **plans to manage the impacts of expansion:** Heathrow’s plans for mitigating the effects of expansion,
including property compensation, Heathrow's Noise Insulation Policy, a Community Fund, and measures to
mitigate against air pollution, carbon, and other environmental effects.

The June 2019 Consultation sets out Heathrow’s draft preferred masterplan and proposed growth in phases – from the
opening of the new runway expected in approximately 2026 to the completion of the masterplan in approximately 2050.
Growth in infrastructure between 2026 and 2050 will align closely with forecast passenger growth. The expansion of
the airport creates benefits for consumers as a result of greater competition and will help airlines schedule and develop
new routes, reduce operational impacts to minimise impact on the customer experience and provide flexibility to
respond if passenger growth performs differently to Heathrow’s forecasts.

At each phase of the draft preferred masterplan, Heathrow set out the infrastructure that will be required to
accommodate estimated passenger numbers (million passengers per annum, or mppa). The phasing shown is indicative
and represents key snapshots in time; the speed of delivery of infrastructure could be affected by changing passenger
demand, affordability or other factors. Heathrow has phased its proposals as follows:

1) **up to around 2026: new North West Runway completed including realignment of the M25, diversion of local**

roads and rivers and completion of surface water treatment requirements;

2) **around 2030 (up to 115 million passengers per annum): partial completion of terminal facilities and satellite**

building, reconfigured cargo areas and some new hotels completed;

LON54468925 58


-----

3) **around 2035 (up to 130 million passengers per annum): additional terminal and satellite facilities, new**

parking areas and further airport related development including hotels; and

4) **around 2050 (up to 140 million passengers per annum): completion of terminal facilities including**

demolition of Terminal 3 and transformation of the Central Terminal Area.

One of the ways Heathrow plans to manage the impact of expansion is through its framework for environmentally
managed growth, which was part of the June 2019 Consultation. It set out Heathrow’s proposals for how growth would
be managed in accordance with environmental limits on air quality, surface access, noise and carbon, and supports
growth in flights at the airport while ensuring Heathrow’s environmental performance stays within maximum limits.

**Judicial Review of the ANPS**

On 1 May 2019, the High Court dismissed all 26 grounds for review of the ANPS with 21 held to be not arguable.
Appeals against that decision brought by four of the Claimants were heard by the Court of Appeal in October 2019, and
a judgment will be handed down in due course.

**Airspace Change**

In parallel with the DCO process, Heathrow has also progressed the approval processes required to implement the
airspace changes associated with the expansion of Heathrow Airport. The changes to Heathrow’s flight paths follow a
separate approvals process to the physical expansion of Heathrow Airport. To obtain permission for changes to flight
paths, an Airspace Change Proposal is required to be submitted to the CAA. Heathrow intends to undertake a full public
consultation on proposed flight path changes required for expansion in 2022.

Heathrow is also considering a number of changes to help the current two runways operate more efficiently. These
include using Independent Parallel Approaches ("IPA"). The proposed introduction of IPA on Heathrow’s existing two
runways has the potential to increase the efficiency and resilience of the airport and it could also be used to facilitate the
proposed early release of capacity in advance of the third runway being brought into operation. Upon receipt of DCO
consent, it is proposed that the current cap of 480,000 ATMs would be increased. Heathrow is proposing to implement
up to an additional 25,000 ATMs on the existing two runways prior to the third runway being brought into operation.

From January to March 2019, Heathrow carried out its Airspace and Future Operations Consultation consulting on
operational and airspace changes for an expanded Heathrow Airport. Heathrow presented airspace design envelopes
(the geographic areas where flight paths could be positioned in future) and asked for comment on any local factors that
should be considered when designing new flight paths to and from Heathrow Airport. Heathrow also sought views on
the ways that it could operate the runways for an expanded Heathrow, including how it could provide breaks from
aircraft noise through its initial proposals for runway and airspace alternation, along with how it should manage night
flights in the future. The feedback received on future operations as part of this consultation has been analysed and is
now summarised in Heathrow’s Future Operations Consultation Feedback Report.

Heathrow is currently reviewing the responses on local factors provided as part of the Airspace and Future Operations
Consultation. Heathrow received over 20,000 suggestions of ‘local factors’ within the design envelopes. These are
locations that respondents would like Heathrow to take into account when designing flight paths for an expanded
Heathrow. These ‘local factors’ will be entered into a database alongside known locations, buildings and sites which
are known to be sensitive to noise and Heathrow will consider the effect of flight path options on these when
undertaking the Options Appraisal (Stage 2B of the CAA’s Airspace Change Process). Heathrow expects to publish a
report on this element of the consultation later in 2019.

**Logistics Hubs**

In March 2019 Heathrow announced the names and locations of the 18 shortlisted sites that remain in the running to be
Heathrow’s four logistics hubs, to help deliver the expanded airport. The sites were selected from a longlist of 65, all of
which were visited during a nationwide tour which concluded in the summer of 2018. The longlisted locations were
then all invited to take part in a pre-qualification questionnaire which helped to determine which sites were best placed
to be involved in the delivery of the project. In the autumn, the 18 sites shortlisted will have the opportunity to pitch to
the airport for their chance to become the final four logistics hubs, to be announced in 2020. The final four sites will
become offsite construction centres that will help to deliver Britain’s new runway as Heathrow looks to construct as
much of the expanded airport offsite as possible. In conjunction with Heathrow’s logistics hubs selection process, it has
also engaged with a number of companies via its Innovation Partners Programme. These innovative approaches will
also help to make the project more affordable and sustainable – by transporting assembled components in consolidated
loads and importing best practice.

LON54468925 59


-----

In addition, there have been a number of regulatory developments related to the expansion of Heathrow Airport. See
_”Airport Regulation—Airport Regulation Generally and ‘Airport Regulation—Heathrow Price Regulation—Q6_
_Extension, iH7 and H7”._

**BREXIT**

Heathrow continues to monitor progress on the proposed Withdrawal Agreement following the extension of the UK’s
date to exit the European Union until the 31 January 2020. The aviation industry remains well positioned for Brexit
contingency plans despite the delay in the approval of the Withdrawal Agreement by the UK. Brexit contingency
regulations have been agreed by both the UK and the EU, which includes continued flight access between the UK and
Europe.

The UK and EU have also agreed to recognise certain security and safety standards. The UK Government has
confirmed that airport certifications will remain valid and unaffected by any changes to the safety regulatory regime
post-Brexit. In addition, current cargo security standards are aligned and equivalent, and will not require new
designations post-Brexit. The UK Government, CAA and the EU have also committed to a minimum of a continuation
of mutual recognition of EASA’s safety system of licenses, certificates and approvals.

Heathrow Airport is unique as the UK’s only hub airport. It benefits from a very well diversified traffic mix and
historically more stable passenger traffic and demand than any other European airport and a robust regulatory
framework. The Group has taken a prudent approach to both operational and financial planning. Contingency plans
have been developed which will help to minimise any potential impact on passengers, including maintaining substantial
headroom to covenant levels and taking steps to provide the Group with sufficient liquidity in place to meet all its
obligations in full until March 2021.

**ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION AND MANAGEMENT**

**Environmental regulation**

Heathrow is subject to or influenced by various regulation and legislation relating to environmental matters, with
provisions related to aircraft noise, air quality and carbon emissions being particularly relevant.

**_Aircraft noise regulation_**

Aircraft noise in and around UK airports is subject to European, UK and local regulation. The EU is assuming
increasing responsibility for the regulation of aircraft noise standards, with EU member states obliged to comply with
the requirements of EU directives and incorporate them into national legislation. The UK government has a key role in
setting and developing the policy framework for aircraft noise control, particularly at designated UK airports. A range
of noise controls relating to aircraft operations are set out in statutory notices and published in the UK Aeronautical
Information Package and elsewhere as appropriate. These controls cover aspects such as departure noise limits and
night flight restrictions.

Additional noise-related controls are a feature of the local planning system that often introduces planning obligations in
section 106 agreements between airport operators and planning authorities. At Heathrow Airport there are various
conditions to the planning permissions for Terminals 4 and 5 that restrict total annual air transport movements and some
aircraft operations at different times of day relative to the location of the activity on the airfield.

**_Air quality and carbon emissions regulation_**

Heathrow Airport is subject to or influenced by various regulations and legislation designed to improve air quality and
reduce carbon emissions. These include global agreements binding the UK to reduce its carbon emissions, EU law
requiring local air quality (whether from airport or other activities) to achieve minimum standards and UK regulations
governing certain activities and operations, specifically the operation of Heathrow’s boiler installations.

In July 2017, the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (“Defra”) published its revised national air
quality action plan which outlines necessary steps to bring the UK into compliance with EU law in the shortest time
possible. Following the latest ruling from the High Court in a case brought by ClientEarth, challenging whether the
Government’s latest plan was adequate to bring air pollution limits into compliance as soon as possible, Defra published
a supplementary plan in October 2018 setting out requirements for feasibility studies to be undertaken in 33 local
authority areas not already considered in the plan, in addition to 23 authorities that already have such actions. Current
and historic data from local air quality monitoring stations show that the immediate vicinity of Heathrow Airport is
already compliant with the nitrogen dioxide limit values. Defra’s latest plan demonstrates that areas within the
Expansion assessment area will be compliant by 2025, which is the same time period that the Greater London area is
expected to be compliant. A significant body of analysis, most recently presented in the Preliminary Environmental

Information Report, demonstrates that it is possible to expand Heathrow Airport while meeting all legal obligations on
air quality. Given the significance of road-traffic in pollution levels around Heathrow (and across London), Heathrow’s
mitigation hinges on its surface access strategy. That strategy sets a goal for a public transport mode share of 50% by
2030 and a commitment to expand without increasing the number of airport-related vehicles on the road.

Heathrow is also subject to regulation and taxation of energy-related CO2 emissions due to the size of combustion plant
on site. The EU Emissions Trading System (“EU ETS”) defines an annually reducing free allowance for emissions
from fossil fuel combustion on site, resulting in an increasing requirement to either reduce emissions or purchase
additional allowances. Further, the Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme, requires Heathrow to
pay the UK government for each tonne of carbon dioxide emitted from fixed asset energy use not already covered by
EU ETS. In addition, the Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme ("ESOS") requires all large businesses in the UK not
certified to ISO 50001 to undertake mandatory assessments looking at energy use and energy efficiency opportunities at
least once every four years.

In September 2019, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) published its letter to the UK government on net-zero
and the approach to international aviation and shipping emissions. In line with previous communication the CCC has
recommended that international aviation and shipping emissions should be included in the UK’s targets to cut
greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. The CCC outlined a range of measures that could be adopted to achieve
this including reformed taxes, a price on carbon or limits to airport capacity and indicated what this could mean for
airport growth, reiterating that growth in demand should be limited to 25% above current levels by 2050. It is expected
that the Department for Transport (DfT) will issue a consultation on net zero carbon and aviation in early 2020 ahead of
publishing its Aviation Strategy in 2020.

**Environmental permits**

Heathrow holds several environmental permits covering activities such as the discharge of surface water runoff to the
environment, water abstraction, waste management, combustion for heating and hot water (boilers) and carbon
emissions trading. The permits are regulated by the Environment Agency and Heathrow operates an ISO 14001
management system to maintain compliance.

**Environmental management**

**_Sustainability and environmental management_**

Heathrow is committed to managing Heathrow Airport in a responsible and sustainable manner seeking to balance the
positive economic and social contribution of Heathrow Airport with its responsibility to minimise its environmental
impact.

With approximately 400 companies employing in the region of 76,000 people at Heathrow Airport, and over 200,000
passengers travelling on nearly 1,300 flights every day, the challenges associated with operating Heathrow Airport
responsibly are complex. Given this environment, Heathrow seeks not only to improve its own environmental
performance but to influence the whole Heathrow community. To this end Heathrow has set up a number of
partnerships such as The Heathrow Sustainability Partnership, the People Leadership Forum, The Clean Vehicles
Partnership and The Responsible Gateway Forum to support collaborative working between businesses operating at
Heathrow Airport and to help Heathrow achieve its commitments to doing business responsibly.

Heathrow’s sustainability and environmental performance is monitored by the Sustainability and Operational Risk
Committee, a sub-committee of the Heathrow Airport Holdings board, that has as one of its key responsibilities the
regular review of Heathrow’s performance and conduct in relation to sustainability and environmental matters.

**_Sustainable growth_**

In February 2017, Heathrow launched Heathrow 2.0, a long-term sustainability strategy which sets out a series of goals
that will guide the future of the business. Heathrow 2.0 focuses on four key pillars:

    - **A Great Place to Work – helping Heathrow's people fulfil their potential;**

    - **A Great Place to Live – working better with Heathrow's neighbours to improve their quality of life;**

    - **A Thriving Sustainable Economy – creating opportunities for business to deliver a stronger future for the**
UK; and

    - **A World Worth Travelling – working with Heathrow's industry and regulator to deliver fair and**
sustainable air travel for future generations to enjoy.

Key achievements in the second year since launch of Heathrow 2.0 include:

LON54468925 61


-----

   - 159 people embarked on apprenticeships through the Heathrow Academy, a step towards Heathrow s goal to
deliver 10,000 by 2030 with an expanded airport. Heathrow also launched a new Shared Apprenticeship
Scheme and responded to recommendations made by the Heathrow Skills Taskforce;

   - “Leading Sustainable Growth” training and development programme rolled out to over 600 senior
colleagues;

   - over 70 of Heathrow’s own vehicles converted to electric or plug-in hybrid, and the highest density of
electric charging infrastructure in Europe with over 100 charging points available airside and to colleagues
and passengers;

   - late running flights reduced by nearly 30 per cent. compared to 2016, representing a significant improvement
for local communities most impacted by aircraft noise. In addition, over 60 per cent. of aircraft movements
were made by aircraft in the quietest noise category;

   - second year as an accredited Living Wage Employer which will see 3,200 airport colleagues receive the
Living Wage by the end of 2020. In November 2018, Heathrow published a plan to ensure all its direct
suppliers also guarantee the Living Wage;

   - achieved Level 3 Carbon trust Supply Chain Accreditation two years ahead of Heathrow’s target, one of only
three companies and the first airport to do so;

   - received the Wildlife Trust’s Biodiversity Benchmark for the 11[th] year running;

   - Terminal 2 is now powered entirely by renewable energy;

   - invested in a project with the Lancashire Wildlife Trust to restore 70 hectares of English peatland reducing
carbon emission, benefiting biodiversity and reducing local flood risk;

   - Heathrow published its carbon neutral growth roadmap showing how it will ensure that the expansion of
Heathrow Airport does not result in a net increase in carbon emission; and

   - launched a passenger awareness campaign to tackle illegal wildlife trafficking.

**Carbon Strategy**

Heathrow's approach to decarbonisation focuses on both initiatives on the ground, such as using renewable energy to
power terminal buildings, and in the air, such as by creating incentives for airlines to operate more efficient aircraft at
Heathrow Airport

**Accelerating the era of sustainable flight**

   - Heathrow’s Carbon Neutral Growth Roadmap sets out the four areas where Heathrow can use its scale and
convening power to influence change:

`o` accelerating the arrival of new aircraft technology;

`o` modernising airspace and making ground operations more efficient;

`o` encouraging the production and take up of sustainable alternative fuels; and

`o` promoting the right carbon pricing to support innovation and developing best practice for offsetting
in the UK.

   - Heathrow currently offers reduced landing fees for the most efficient aircraft which operate at Heathrow
Airport. Next, Heathrow intends to make environmental criteria such as aircraft fuel efficiency and emissions
a key consideration in the way landing and take-off slots are allocated following the expansion of Heathrow
Airport. In 2018, Heathrow announced that the first electric aircraft to operate a commercially-viable flight
from Heathrow Airport will have a year’s free landing charges, worth up to £1 million.

   - Heathrow is working to supply plug-in power at every aircraft stand at the airport and plug in air conditioning
at over half the plane stands to reduce the need for aircraft to keep engines running while on stand. Heathrow
is also working with infrastructure providers to make Heathrow Airport ready for the arrival of electric
aircraft.

   - Heathrow is already supporting sustainable fuel pilot projects such as British Airways’ work with Velocys on
converting household waste, and Virgin Atlantic’s with Lanzatech on using waste industrial gases.

   - Heathrow supports the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (“COSIA”), the
world's first sector-wide market-based measure for offsetting the growth in carbon emissions from the
aviation industry that will start operating in 2021 and will become mandatory from 2026. Heathrow expects

LON54468925 62


-----

around 95 per cent. of additional aircraft emissions from the expansion of Heathrow Airport will be offset
through CORSIA.

**Towards zero carbon airport infrastructure**

Heathrow has also focused on investment in energy efficiency which has helped Heathrow to cut electricity
consumption and strengthen energy efficiency standards for new buildings and infrastructure. Heathrow has also
invested in on-site renewable energy generation, an example of this includes the biomass fuelled Combined Heat and
Power Plant that forms part of Heathrow’s Energy Centre and supplies Terminal 2. As part of Heathrow 2.0, Heathrow
continues to pursue these objectives by aiming to operate zero carbon airport infrastructure (such as, buildings and other
fixed assets) by 2050 with clear interim targets.

In addition, for many years Heathrow has actively encouraged use of more sustainable transport by passengers and
people working at Heathrow Airport. Heathrow will convert its entire fleet of cars and vans to electric or plug-in hybrid
by 2020. In addition, Heathrow operates the world’s largest single-site car sharing scheme, the UK’s first publicly
accessible hydrogen refuelling site and a public transport system linking passengers to surrounding communities and
central London (including free travel on bus rail and London Underground journeys around Heathrow Airport paid for
by Heathrow). Heathrow Airport is connected to 60 towns and cities by public transport links and the Heathrow Express
rail service transports six million passengers a year. In 2018, Heathrow installed ticket barriers, upgraded ticket
machines and made improvements to customer information in train stations ready for the arrival of TFL Rail which will
become the Elizabeth Line (also known as Crossrail). Heathrow is also supporting government proposals for new
western and southern rail services to Heathrow Airport. For more information, see _“Business—Heathrow Airport’s_
_Infrastructure, Facilities and Access—Access to Heathrow Airport”._

Heathrow 2.0 expands these activities to the supply chain and has achieved Level 3 Carbon Trust Supply Chain
Accreditation by setting quantitative reduction targets for the carbon impact from Heathrow’s supply chain. Heathrow
also aims to provide support on energy efficiency to its first tier strategic suppliers by 2020 and increase the percentage
of strategic suppliers that have undertaken an assessment of climate change vulnerability and pursued actions to adapt
accordingly. See “Risk Factors—Regulatory Risks—The Group could face costs related to environmental, health and
_safety and planning considerations”_

**Local air quality**

To help improve local air quality, Objective 5 in Heathrow 2.0 includes two overall targets:

  - reduce NOx emissions from airport related traffic by at least 40 per cent. by 2020, and 60 per cent. by 2025
(from 2013 baseline); and

  - reduce NOx emissions from airside vehicles by at least 50 per cent. by 2020, and 70 per cent. by 2025 (from
2013 baseline).
To achieve these targets, Heathrow 2.0 is made up of many goals and strategies. The two flagship goals related to
improving air quality are:

  - an airside ultra-low emissions zone by 2025 to improve quality of life through cleaner air; and

  - 50 per cent. airport passenger journeys made by public and sustainable transport by 2030, supporting no more
airport-related cars on the road, so local areas can thrive without increased congestion.

**_Aircraft noise management_**

Heathrow’s approach to aircraft noise management is set out in its Noise Action Plan 2019-2023 (“NAP”). This focuses
on analysing and implementing various measures to reduce noise impacts through reduction at source (quieter aircraft),
land-use planning and management, noise abatement operational procedures and operating restrictions as well as
engaging and collaborating with the community and other key stakeholders in delivery of noise reduction initiatives. On
13 February 2019, Defra officially notified Heathrow that it had adopted its NAP which had been submitted following
Heathrow’s public consultation in 2018. NAP sets out Heathrow's approach to noise management of current aircraft
operations over the next five years.

The Heathrow Strategic Noise Advisory Group brings together Heathrow, representatives from the Department for
Transport, the CAA, NATS, IATA, British Airways, noise pressure group HACAN and a local authority group, and
seeks to foster collaboration in noise management at Heathrow Airport.

The Heathrow Community Noise Forum (“HCNF”), established in 2015, aims to keep residents and local stakeholders
informed on areas such as airspace planning, future trials and consultations, and to develop the understanding of
airspace and operational issues.

**RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

Heathrow has entered and may from time to time in the future enter into transactions with certain affiliates of Heathrow
Airport Holdings and its shareholders. All such contracts are and will be negotiated on an arm’s-length basis.

**SHARED SERVICES**

Pursuant to a Shared Services Agreement, LHR Airports provides or procures third parties to provide certain central
support services to the Group to assist with the running and management of Heathrow Airport and Heathrow Express.

**Services provided by LHR Airports, or Heathrow as a sub-contractor for LHR Airports**

The services provided by LHR Airports include management services (such as senior management and strategic
direction), IT, health and safety, security, research, airport planning and marketing, finance, human resources, property
management, regulatory services, corporate and public affairs and legal support. From 1 January 2013, following the
divestment of Gatwick Airport and in light of the (at that time) expected divestment of Stansted Airport and to reflect
more accurately the current organisation and economic reality, LHR Airports sub-contracted the majority of these
services to Heathrow. Heathrow, as a sub-contractor for LHR Airports, provides certain central support services for
Heathrow Express. Additionally, pursuant to a separate agreement, LHR Airports has sub-contracted certain of the cash
management and accounting services to LHR Business Support Centre Limited.

All of the staff working for Heathrow are employed and provided by LHR Airports. Heathrow Express employs some
of its own staff directly with other staff being provided through a services agreement with First Greater Western
Limited.

The terms on which services and staff are provided to the Group are set out in the Shared Services Agreement. Central
support services are provided by Heathrow to Heathrow Express pursuant to a separate agreement between Heathrow
and Heathrow Express.

**Fees payable to LHR Airports**

Heathrow pays a fee to LHR Airports which comprises:

(a) the cost to LHR Airports of providing the services; and

(b) in respect of centralised airport services, administrative and business support services and corporate services, a
margin of 7.5 per cent.

The majority of costs for employees provided under the Shared Services Agreement are included in the charges for
airport services and capital project services, to which the margin does not apply. The margin payable to LHR Airports
in relation to services to the Group was £0.6 million in the 12 months ended 31 December 2018 (2017: £0.4 million).

**Termination of Shared Services Agreement**

Subject to the prior written consent of the Borrower Security Trustee, the Operating Companies have the right to
terminate the Shared Services Agreement in the case of a breach by LHR Airports with a material adverse effect not
remedied within 30 days, certain insolvency related events in relation to LHR Airports or if it becomes illegal for either
LHR Airports or the Obligors to perform their obligations under the Shared Services Agreement.

LHR Airports may terminate the Shared Services Agreement only where:

(a) another suitable and properly resourced member of the Heathrow Airport Holdings Group (excluding any
members of the Group) is appointed to act as replacement Shared Services Provider on substantially the same
terms;

(b) a replacement Shared Services Provider is appointed with the consent of and approved by the Borrower
Security Trustee and, unless otherwise agreed as an Extraordinary Voting Matter, a Ratings Confirmation is
provided; or

(c) the Operating Companies fail to pay any amounts of £50,000 or more to LHR Airports under the Shared
Services Agreement, subject to a 30 Business Day grace period.

The Shared Services Agreement will terminate in respect of an Operating Company which ceases to be controlled by
LHR Airports. Unless otherwise agreed, termination will take effect 6 months from the date that the Operating
Company ceases to be controlled by LHR Airports.

LHR Airports is entitled to pass pensions costs on to the Group. These relate principally to LHR Airports’ obligation to
fund the Heathrow Airport Holdings Group defined benefit pension scheme and are calculated on a basis linked to
pensionable payroll in respect of those employees that LHR Airports makes available to the Operating Companies

LON54468925 64


-----

under the Shared Services Agreement. In certain circumstances, the obligation of the Operating Companies to meet
pension costs will survive termination of the agreement.

In the event of termination of the Shared Services Agreement, LHR Airports is required to use its reasonable
endeavours to facilitate the transfer of the terminated services to the Operating Companies (or to any replacement
servicer appointed by the Operating Companies) with a view to ensuring an orderly and efficient transfer with minimal
disruption to the ongoing business of the Operating Companies. The employment of relevant airport level staff is
expected to pass to the relevant Operating Company or to a replacement service provider.

**Potential Conflicts of Interest**

As a result of the fact that Heathrow and Heathrow Express have entered into the Shared Services Agreement, there
may be potential conflicts of interest for Ross Baker, Stuart Birrell, Chris Garton, Javier Echave, Emma Gilthorpe, John
Holland-Kaye, Carol Hui, Andrew Macmillan and Paula Stannett who are directors of LHR Airports (which is the
provider of the shared services) and Heathrow (which receives the shared services) and, in the case of Ross Baker and
Andrew Macmillan, Heathrow Express. Potential conflicts of interest may arise where the same individuals are directors
of both the entity providing the shared services and the entities receiving the shared services because they have, among
other obligations, a duty to promote the success of the companies of which they are directors. A potential conflict may
arise for the individuals listed above if what is in the best interest of one company is not necessarily in the best interest
of the other.

For a description of certain risks associated with the Shared Services Agreement, see “Risk Factors—Commercial
_Risk—The Group is dependent on LHR Airports as Shared Services Provider to operate its businesses”._

**INSURANCE**

LHR Airports provides insurance and claims handling services to the Operating Companies. LHR Airports arranges
both annual and multi-year insurance programmes on a group-wide basis for the Heathrow Airport Holdings Group.
Heathrow Rail operations have separate public liability insurance cover and Heathrow, through LHR Airports, has
separate policies to protect against specific risks.

The Heathrow Airport Holdings Group insurance programmes, which are required under the CTA, include the
following insurance cover:

   - **_property damage and business interruption insurance and construction all-risks insurance which covers all_**
risks (including terrorism) of sudden accidental direct physical loss or destruction of, or damage to, insured
property and resultant loss of revenue and/or increased costs of maintaining normal business activities. There is
also a separate policy covering specified tenanted properties, which provides cover on the basis of individual
property sums insured;

   - **_general liability insurance, including aviation liability, aviation war/terrorism, public/product liability; public_**
liability with respect to the Heathrow rail activities; and construction third-party liability;

   - third-party financial loss and professional indemnity insurance; and

   - employers’ liability insurance.

Insurance cover for the Group is provided by a combination of insurance market entities and a captive insurance
company owned by LHR Airports.

The financing agreements (within the CTA) require the Obligors to effect and maintain insurance policies in relation to
liabilities, undertakings and assets in accordance with good industry insurance practice. Details of these insurance
policies are provided annually to an insurance adviser acting on behalf of certain secured creditors.

Some insurance cover for the Group is provided by Heathrow Airport Holdings’ own captive insurance company, LHR
Insurance Services Ltd (the “Captive”). The Captive enables the Heathrow Airport Holdings Group to access
reinsurance markets (including Pool Re for property terrorism risks), to leverage the Heathrow Airport Holdings
Group’s combined position on the conventional insurance market and to offer funding options for the Group’s selfinsured retention. The Captive underwrites some group-wide risks and also funds some of the Heathrow Airport
Holdings Group’s self-insured retention.

For more information on insurance, see “Risk Factors – Commercial Risks – The Group’s insurance coverage might not
_be adequate or available in all circumstances”._

**PENSIONS**

The Heathrow Airport Holdings Group operates a number of pension schemes for its employees. The main schemes,
which are sponsored by LHR Airports, the employing company within the Heathrow Airport Holdings Group, comprise

LON54468925 65


-----

a defined benefit pension scheme that closed to employees joining LHR Airports after 15 June 2008 (the **Pension**
**Scheme”) and a defined contribution pension plan (the “Plan”) that employees joining LHR Airports since 16 June**
2008 are eligible to join. There are also separate defined contribution pension schemes for employees of Heathrow
Express and LHR Business Support Centre Limited (the “BSC”).

Under the terms of the Shared Services Agreement, Heathrow makes monthly cash payments into the Pension Scheme
determined by the latest agreement made with the Trustee of the Pension Scheme. Employer contributions into the
defined contribution pension plan are currently determined as a percentage of the aggregate basic salary, plus skills
based pay, for all relevant scheme members. Under the terms of the Shared Services Agreement, Heathrow is also liable
to fund any deficit in the Pension Scheme. The Pension Scheme also has a right to receive up to £284 million of the
proceeds of an enforcement of the security granted by the Obligors, which right ranks pari passu with senior (Class A)
debt.

The Pension Scheme is administered by a corporate trustee, the BAA Pension Trust Company Limited (the “Pension
**Trustee”). The directors of the corporate trustee comprise three elected employee representatives, one pensioner**
representative and four LHR Airports nominated directors. In addition, the Scheme rules require the appointment of an
Independent Trustee (currently fulfilled by Law Debenture Trust Company). As at 30 September 2019, the Pension
Scheme had 2,691 current ‘active’ members, 9,097 pensioners (including pensions paid to surviving partners and
dependents) and 4,791 deferred pensioners.

The most recent actuarial valuation of the Pension Scheme, undertaken by the Pension Trustee as at 30 September 2018,
concluded in October 2019 and indicated a scheme deficit of £123 million calculated using the Pension Trustee’s
actuarial assumptions. As part of the valuation process, LHR Airports and the Pension Trustee agreed that the annual
deficit recovery payment into the Pension Scheme would decrease from £23 million to £20 million that is intended to
eliminate the deficit by 30 September 2022. In addition, in respect of future accrual of benefits, LHR Airports would
contribute approximately 25.6% per cent. of basic salary and shift pay, which for the financial year ending 31 December
2018 was £25.0 million

The reduction in deficit recovery and future accrual cash payments arose from the changes introduced with effect from
1 October 2015, following consultation with affected Pension Scheme members required by applicable regulation,
_subsequent cash contributions and investment returns on the Scheme’s assets._

The changes introduced, impacting only active members of the Pension Scheme, were:

   - a reduction in future benefit accrual rate from 1/54th to 1/60th of pensionable pay;

   - the introduction of an annual cap of 2 per cent. on future increases in pensionable pay; and

   - a cap of 2.5 per cent. on annual increases to pension payments in retirement for pension benefits accrued from
1 October 2015.

Recognition of these changes for accounting purposes was immediately reflected in the Group’s financial statements in
accordance with IAS19. In particular, there was a one-off (non-cash) credit of £236 million in 2015 as a result of the
introduction of the annual cap of 2 per cent. on future increases in pensionable pay.

At 31 December 2018 the Pension Scheme had a deficit of £3.5 million compared to a £124 million deficit at 31
December 2017, both as measured under IAS19. The £120.5 million reduction in deficit in the year was primarily due
to net actuarial gains on liabilities due to changes in assumptions (£376m), offset by a combination of lower than
anticipated returns when compared to interest on assets (£212.4m) and adjustment from the purchase of a bulk annuity
policy (£22.2m). In 2018, Heathrow contributed £48 million (2017: £50 million) into the defined benefit pension
scheme including £23 million (2017: £23 million) in deficit repair contributions.

The cost to the Heathrow Airport Holdings Group of contributions to defined contribution pension schemes in 2018 was
approximately £13.1 million (2017: £10 million).

For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Commercial Risks—Heathrow and Heathrow Express (together, the
_“Operating Companies” and each an “Operating Company”) could be subject to periodic increase in pension cash_
_contributions in the future”._

**AIRPORT REGULATION**

**AIRPORT REGULATION GENERALLY**

Heathrow is subject to economic regulation by the Civil Aviation Authority (“CAA”). The CAA is the independent
aviation regulator in the UK, responsible for economic regulation, airspace policy, safety and consumer protection.

As the economic regulator for UK airports, the CAA assesses the market power of airports and if an airport passes the
market power test(s) set out in the Civil Aviation Act 2012 (the **“Civil Aviation Act”), the airport is regulated by**
means of a licence. Heathrow has been determined, by the CAA, to hold significant market power and operates under a
licence granted by the CAA in February 2014. The licence includes a price cap on Heathrow’s airport charges.

The CAA sets the maximum level of airport charges for Heathrow, generally for five-year periods, known as
Quinquennium. Heathrow’s current regulatory period was initially for four years and nine months from 1 April 2014 to
31 December 2018 in order to align Heathrow’s financial and regulatory years. A summary of the regulatory settlement
for the current regulatory period is set out in “Heathrow Price Regulation—Key Elements of the CAA’s Q6 Decision”
below. In December 2016, the CAA published modifications to Heathrow’s licence (which took effect from 1 February
2017) extending Heathrow’s current regulatory period by one year so that it will end on 31 December 2019, rolling over
the current price control of RPI-1.5 per cent. for the additional year.

Given the timetable for the expansion of Heathrow Airport, the CAA has decided to extend Q6 by a further two years to
31 December 2021. The extended two-year period is known as interim Heathrow 7 (“iH7”). In November 2019 the
CAA formalised the decision by updating Heathrow’s licence.

In parallel to the CAA setting the price conditions for the iH7 period, Heathrow and the airline community have reached
a commercial agreement. The commercial agreement is intended to be implemented alongside the price path of RPI1.5%. The CAA has decided that the commercial agreement is in the interest of consumers and formalised the necessary
licence changes in November 2019, to reflect the agreement over iH7 alongside the necessary changes to the licence to
extend the price control.

Heathrow is regulated by means of a price control mechanism known as RPI +/- X, which incorporates an allowed
return on the Regulatory Asset Base (referred to as the “RAB”). This is consistent with the economic regulation of other
UK regulated industries (such as telecoms and the energy and water sectors). This form of economic regulation is also
sometimes referred to as incentive based regulation, in that Heathrow has an incentive to outperform the price control
by means of attracting more passengers (measured against the CAAs forecast for the relevant period), reducing
operating costs or delivering higher commercial revenues than forecasted. If the opposite is the case, then Heathrow has
to absorb the cost. There is not a retrospective adjustment for shortfalls in income or additional costs (except,
principally, where Heathrow incurs additional security costs, above an established threshold, when implementing new
security directives imposed by the EU or the UK Government).

**The CAA and its statutory powers and objectives**

The CAA in its role as economic regulator has a single primary duty to further the interests of users of air transport
services regarding the range, availability, continuity, cost and quality of airport operation services (where appropriate,
by promoting competition in the provision of airport operation services). There are also supplementary duties to which
the CAA must have regard in fulfilling its primary duty:

   - the need to secure that each holder of a licence is able to finance its provision of airport operation services in
the area for which the licence is granted;

   - the need to secure that all reasonable demands for airport operation services are met;

   - the need to promote economy and efficiency on the part of each holder of a licence in its provision of airport
operation services at the airport to which the licence relates;

   - the need to secure that each holder of a licence is able to take reasonable measures to reduce, control or
mitigate the adverse environmental effects of the airport to which the licence relates, facilities used or intended
to be used in connection with that airport (“associated facilities”) and aircraft using that airport;

   - any guidance issued to the CAA by the Secretary of State for Transport;

   - any international obligation of the UK notified to the CAA by the Secretary of State for Transport; and

LON54468925 67


-----

the principles that regulatory activities should be carried out in a way which is transparent, accountable,
proportionate and consistent, and that regulatory activities should be targeted only at cases in which action is
needed.

In its duties, the CAA also must take account of the UK’s international obligations which provide, among other things,
that airport charges for non-national aircraft are not higher than those paid by national aircraft engaged in similar
operations.

The European Directive 2009/12/EC on airport charges was implemented into UK law by the Airport Charges
Regulations 2011 which entered into force on 10 November 2011. They establish a common framework for the
provision of information by airports to airport users and airport users to airports, airports consulting their airline
customers about airport charges, service level agreements and major infrastructure projects, and the setting of charges
and the allocation of spare capacity. The CAA is the nominated “independent supervisory agency” under the Airport
Charges Regulations 2011 and, following a consultation, in October 2015 published its guidance on the application of
the CAA’s powers under the Airport Charges Regulations 2011.

**PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMIC REGULATION**

The Civil Aviation Act prohibits an operator of a dominant airport area from charging for airport operation services,
unless it has a licence granted by the CAA. An airport area is dominant if the CAA determines (and publishes) that the
Market Power Test (“MPT”) in the Civil Aviation Act is met by the relevant airport operator. The MPT has three parts:

   - whether the relevant operator has, or is likely to acquire, substantial market power in a market, either alone or
taken with such other persons as the CAA considers appropriate;

   - whether competition law does not provide sufficient protection against the risk that the relevant operator may
engage in conduct that amounts to an abuse of that substantial market power; and

   - for users of air transport services, the benefits of regulating the relevant operator by means of a licence are
likely to outweigh the adverse effects.

In January 2014, the CAA confirmed that the MPT was met in relation to the core area of Heathrow Airport and that
Heathrow’s significant market power is likely to endure for the Q6 period.

**The Price Cap**

The price cap for Heathrow is based on a Regulatory Asset Base (“RAB”) methodology using a “single till” building
block approach. The single till takes into account revenue and costs from both aeronautical and non-aeronautical
activities when setting the price caps.

In setting the price cap, the CAA determines the regulated revenue requirement. This is calculated as the sum of
forecast operating expenditure less other revenue plus the required return (using the cost of capital determined by the
CAA) on the forecast RAB (taking into account forecast capital expenditure), plus regulatory depreciation and plus or
minus RPI inflation. The resulting regulated revenue requirement effectively amounts to the total income from airport
charges.

This methodology for deriving the regulated revenue requirement can be represented by the simplified diagram below:

**Regulatory Building Blocks**

The regulated revenue requirement is divided by forecast passenger numbers which, subject to a price profiling
adjustment to smooth charges across the regulatory period, establishes the price cap expressed as a maximum allowable
yield per passenger.

LON54468925 68


-----

Since the start of the current regulatory period, the maximum allowable yield changes from 1 January each year by RPI
+/- X per cent. based on RPI from the previous April.

In setting the price cap the CAA will take its own view of the scope for future efficiency savings, the appropriate level
of capital expenditure, the average cost of capital associated with Heathrow’s risk and the rate of growth in demand for
airport services by means of a central passenger forecast. Whilst the price cap places a limit on the increase in the
airport charges yield, Heathrow is exposed to traffic risk within the regulatory period. Any incremental traffic above the
CAA’s forecast is upside and any reduction in traffic in relation to the CAA’s forecast is downside. Heathrow has the
discretion on whether to price to the maximum permitted level. For example, if there is unused capacity, Heathrow
could choose to set prices below the cap in order to stimulate demand.

The price control conditions set by the CAA include the following components for the maximum allowable yield:

   - The “S factor” mechanism is designed to adjust the maximum allowable yield within the relevant
Quinquennium for either additional or reduced security costs incurred as a result of new UK legislation or EU
security directives applicable in the UK. For the current regulatory period, the adjustment enables Heathrow to
pass through 90 per cent. of any additional (or reduced) security costs around a deadband of £20 million.

   - The “K factor” is designed to correct for any under recovery (dilution) or over recovery (concentration) in
airport charges compared to the annual maximum allowable yield per passenger. Under or over recoveries
generally arise due to changes in traffic mix or average loads compared to those forecast at the time airport
charges were set for the relevant year. For example, an increase in the proportion of long-haul departing
passengers would result in yield concentration leading to an over recovery. Conversely, an increase in average
load factors or the proportion of transfer passengers would cause yield dilution. The K factor adjustment is
applied to the maximum allowable yield calculation two years after the year in which it is incurred and
therefore can be carried forward to the following Quinquennium.

   - There is a capital expenditure “trigger” term built into the price control for Heathrow, with provision for the
maximum allowable yield to be reduced if specified project milestones are not delivered on time.

   - There is a development capital expenditure adjustment, with provision for the maximum allowable yield to be
adjusted to account for changes in the revenue requirement associated with development capital projects.

   - There is a service quality rebate scheme at Heathrow Airport which sets defined service standards for a range
of services and facilities. See “Heathrow Price Regulation—SQRB Scheme” below.

**Regulatory Asset Base**

As with other regulated utilities in the UK, the RAB acts as a unit of regulatory value and does not correspond to
statutory asset values. The CAA has historically determined the value of the RAB for Heathrow over each year of the
Quinquennium. The closing RAB for Heathrow for each year is taken to be the sum of the opening RAB, plus actual
capital expenditure (unless disallowed by the CAA) plus an adjustment for RPI inflation less regulatory depreciation
(including the pricing profile adjustment _—_ see “The Price Cap” above) and less proceeds of any disposals at the
airport.

Heathrow is required to submit regulatory accounts to the CAA as at 31 December of each year identifying, among
other things, the value of the RAB. A decision as to whether the current period RAB has been appropriately updated
during the current regulatory period is not made until the CAA sets the opening RAB for the next Quinquennium as part
of the price control review.

The RAB is independently verified by Heathrow’s statutory auditors and included in the regulatory accounts which are
provided annually to (but not approved by) the CAA.

**HEATHROW PRICE REGULATION**

**Key Elements of the CAA’s Q6 Decision**

The CAA’s decision in respect of Heathrow for Q6 was published on 10 January 2014 and subsequently set out in
Heathrow’s licence issued on 13 February 2014. The key elements of the CAA’s licence for the original 4 year and 9
month period covered by Q6 include:

   - a continuation of the RAB-based construct using the single-till and incentive based regulation in the form of an
RPI based price cap;

   - a maximum allowable yield based on RPI -1.5 per cent;

LON54468925 69


-----

a WACC (weighted average cost of capital, which is the CAA s assessment, using a notional capital structure
of 60 per cent. debt and 40 per cent. equity, of the allowed blended cost of debt and return on equity to satisfy
the requirements of capital providers over the Quinquennium) of 5.35 per cent. (pre-tax real);

   - assumed capital expenditure of £2.816 billion (in 2011/12 prices);

   - projected operating costs of £4.731 billion (in 2011/12 prices);

   - a “write down” of £30 million to the RAB to reflect the CAA’s view of capital inefficiency on a specific
project undertaken during Q5;

   - forecast aggregate passengers of 347.7 million including an allowance for the impact of demand “shocks”
(other than macro-economic related impacts) in the derivation of the passenger forecast;

   - a split between “core” and “development” capital expenditure to allow for greater flexibility in the capital
planning process. Under this arrangement, designation of capital expenditure as core represents firm
investment commitments at the start of the Q6 price control period where the scope and cost estimate were
reasonably certain. Designation of capital expenditure as development enables projects to be included over the
Q6 price control period that were not sufficiently scoped or costed at the start of Q6. The CAA set an initial
capital expenditure envelope for Q6 comprising a fixed allowance for core capital expenditure and an
indicative allowance for development capital; and

   - a business rates revaluation factor to pass through changes in rates costs arising from the 2017 national
business rates revaluation process above or below a 9 per cent. increase.

**Q6 Extension, iH7 and H7**

The current Quinquennium for Heathrow, Q6, was initially set for four years and nine months from 1 April 2014 to 31
December 2018 in order to align Heathrow’s financial and regulatory years. In December 2016, to deal with the
uncertainty associated with the Government’s decision on the location for capacity expansion in the South East of
England, the CAA announced that it would extend the regulatory period by one year (to end on 31 December 2019),
rolling over the current price control of RPI-1.5 per cent. for the additional year.

Given the timetable for the expansion of Heathrow Airport, the CAA has decided to extend Q6 by a further two years to
31 December 2021. The extended two-year period is known as interim Heathrow 7 (“iH7”). In November 2019 the
CAA formalised the decision by updating Heathrow’s licence.

Following CAP1769, the CAA is also expected to confirm that the price path for iH7 will be RPI-1.5% for the year
ending 2020 and 2021. The CAA also indicated that changes to the timetable (that is, further extensions to Q6) may still
be possible if there are “very significant changes” to the statutory process associated with expansion. Heathrow and the
airline community have reached a commercial agreement that would be implemented alongside the price path of RPI1.5%. This in effect removes the need for the CAA to assess the revenue requirement allowed for Heathrow throughout
iH7. The CAA has decided that the commercial agreement is in the interest of consumers, with the necessary licence
changes to reflect the agreement over iH7 expected in November alongside the necessary changes to the licence to
extend the price control.

As at the date of this Prospectus, the commercial agreement has been signed by a number of key airlines from multiple
alliances and groups representing more than 85% of Heathrow Airport's traffic. Under the agreement, Heathrow offers a
fixed rebate to all airlines provided a given threshold number of passengers is reached and also offers a volume rebate
associated with airlines’ individual performance. The rebates and threshold are offered and calculated for all airlines,
using consistent principles in a non-discriminatory basis.

The rebate creates an incentive for airlines to make better use of Heathrow Airport’s existing capacity by way of a
volume discount while also providing protection in the event that passenger volumes were to fall below current levels
prior to 2022. Another benefit of the commercial agreement is that it will enable all parties to concentrate on the longer
term aim of securing a regulatory settlement for H7 which will support affordable and financeable expansion of
Heathrow Airport.

The CAA, with the support of the Independent Planner Cost Reviewer (IPCR), has assessed whether Heathrow has
efficiently incurred planning permission related costs of £82m for the period 25 October 2016 to December 2017. The
CAA’s decision is that Heathrow can recover £80m of the total spent; it cannot recover £1.2m of these costs, and
further evidence and analysis is required to allow the recovery of £0.8m (of the total £82m). The timing of the
implementation of this decision is yet to be confirmed by the CAA.

**Expansion of Heathrow Airport – Regulatory Developments**

There have been a number of, and there are expected to be further, regulatory developments related to the expansion of
Heathrow Airport. The CAA has categorised costs incurred or to be incurred by Heathrow in relation to potential future
expansion of Heathrow Airport into three categories:

   - Category A, costs incurred by Heathrow prior to the decision by the UK Government on 25 October 2016 to
support Heathrow expansion;

   - Category B, costs incurred in connection with the DCO process; and

   - Category C, pre-construction and construction costs in relation to expansion typically incurred following the
grant of a DCO.

In relation to Category A costs, the CAA has determined that the recovery of most of these costs through airport charges
will not be permitted.

In July 2016, the CAA commenced consultation on the regulatory treatment of Category B costs. In December 2016 the
CAA modified Heathrow’s economic licence to allow the annual recovery of up to £10 million of Category B costs
through airport charges.

The CAA’s policy statement on the treatment of Category B costs above £10 million was published in February 2017
and included mechanisms that allow:

(i) costs in excess of £10 million per annum to be added to the RAB;

(ii) the regulatory cost of capital to accrue on the costs once added to the RAB;

(iii) recovery of the costs following the decision on the grant of the DCO; and

(iv) risk sharing under which either 105 per cent. or 85 per cent. of costs added to the RAB will be recovered if the
DCO is granted or not granted, respectively.

In addition, the CAA will perform the usual efficiency test to allow for the recovery of any Category B costs and
indicated that it would reconsider its policy position on Category B costs if they significantly exceed £265 million. See
“Airport Regulation —Airport Regulation Generally”.

Heathrow currently expects that approximately £500 million in Category B costs will be incurred primarily between
2017 and 2021.

In July 2019, the CAA published a new consultation titled “Economic regulation of capacity expansion at Heathrow
airport: consultation on early costs and regulatory timetable (CAP1819)”. In this consultation the CAA consults on the
regulatory treatment of Category B costs over £265m. In this consultation, the CAA discusses the potential changes to
the regulatory treatment of Category B costs above £265m, namely the possibility of removing any premium associated
to achieving successful DCO for those costs above the £265m and the most appropriate return for these costs in 2020
and 2021.

In relation to Category C costs, in its December 2017 consultation the CAA stated its support for early compensation
costs for commercial and residential costs to be added to the RAB. The CAA requires further information on enabling
costs in order to consider this further.

The CAA’s consultation published in April 2018 affirms the CAA’s support to start incurring Category C costs related
to land acquisition, surveying, design or very early construction work before the DCO is granted and confirms that these
costs should be recoverable. Heathrow expects these costs to be incurred between 2018 and 2021 when the outcome of
the DCO is expected.

The consultation titled “Economic regulation of capacity expansion at Heathrow airport: consultation on early costs and
regulatory timetable (CAP1819)” also discusses the regulatory treatment of pre-DCO Category C costs and the
timetable for H7. Regarding pre-DCO Category C costs, the CAA confirms that these costs are in the interest of
consumers and that these should be added to Heathrow’s RAB and if efficiently delivered be recoverable by Heathrow.
In addition, the CAA consults on what is the most appropriate allowed return for these costs in 2020 and 2021 and next
steps to formally give effect to its policy on these costs.

It is expected that the CAA will formalise its policy on pre-DCO Category C costs by 2019.

**H7 Developments**

LON54468925 71


-----

The regulatory period commencing at the end of iH7 is known as H7 ( H7 ).

There have been a number of regulatory developments related to the expansion of Heathrow Airport, with more
expected during the course of 2019.

The CAA's objective in developing the framework for H7 is to find a framework that facilitates affordable
and financeable delivery of new capacity, driving competition and choice in the best interest of consumers. The CAA
continues to progress its thinking on the H7 framework and launched a new consultation titled “Economic regulation of
capacity expansion at Heathrow: policy update and consultation (CAP1782)” at the end of March 2019. In this
consultation the CAA:

a)  discusses an integrated approach to assessing whether the H7 price control is financeable by considering risk,

incentives and the required return to ensure a financeable outcome;

b)  continues to consider that there are merits to the case for a potential modification to Heathrow's licence by

means of a new condition promoting economy and efficiency in the operation, maintenance and development
of the airport;

c)  provides a further update on its approach to issues raised by potential alternative arrangements for delivering

new capacity at Heathrow airport. The CAA confirms that it does not plan to undertake significant work on
alternative arrangements unless robust evidence emerges that alternative delivery models are in the interest of
consumers; and

d)  further investigates the potential introduction of new capital investment incentives and how these may affect

the risk and reward balance.

In July 2019, as set out above, the CAA published a new consultation titled “Economic regulation of capacity expansion
at Heathrow airport: consultation on early costs and regulatory timetable (CAP1819)”. In this consultation, the CAA
confirms its preference for Heathrow to submit an initial business plan in December 2019 followed by a period of
extensive consultation with the airline community. Reflecting the feedback received, Heathrow would have the
opportunity to submit a final business plan for consideration by the CAA and stakeholders in 2020.

In August 2019, the CAA launched a further consultation titled “Economic regulation of Heathrow Airport Limited
working paper on financial resilience and ring fencing (CAP 1832)”. Consistent with its duties, the CAA aims to
ensuring that the Heathrow remains financially resilient throughout H7 in order to deliver expansion. In this working
paper the CAA discusses potential alternatives to do so and we agree with the CAA that financeability and financial
resilience are instrumental objectives to delivering expansion.

In addition, in October 2019 the CAA made its final decision regarding surface access policy. This will guide
Heathrow’s future surface access investment. It confirms that Heathrow will be able to recover efficiently invested
surface access investment and costs in accordance with the policy.

**Section 16 Advice**

In accordance with the Secretary of State’s powers under section 16 (1) of the Civil Aviation Act 2012, the CAA has
been requested to advise the Secretary of State on how well Heathrow is engaging with and responding to the airline
community on the appropriate scope, design and costing of new runway capacity.

The CAA has published four interim reports with the final report submitted to the Secretary of State in April 2018. In its
reports, the CAA recognises the significant engagement underway between Heathrow and the airline community. The
CAA recognises that the engagement has improved. Nevertheless, it highlights that Heathrow needs to ensure that the
airline community has access to relevant information on the key elements of the expansion masterplan to ensure that it
can provide meaningful input. In addition, the CAA has reported to the DfT on whether there are credible scenarios in
which expansion can be delivered in an affordable and financeable manner. The CAA’s advice to the DfT concludes
that this is the case.

**SQRB Scheme**

Heathrow’s licence for Q6 includes a service quality rebate and bonus (“SQRB”) scheme similar to the SQRB scheme
that applied during Q5 with defined service targets for a range of services - security queuing times, departure lounge
seat availability, cleanliness, way-finding, flight information, arrivals baggage carousels availability, passenger asset
availability (lifts, escalators and track transit system) and airline asset availability (piers, jetties, fixed electrical ground
power, pre-conditioned air and stands). The service standards cover also includes an Aerodrome Congestion Term.

LON54468925 72


-----

To the extent that Heathrow does not achieve the defined standards, rebates to airlines are required. The maximum total
revenue at risk during the Quinquennium is 7 per cent. of the total airport charges. Heathrow can achieve a 1.44 per
cent. revenue upside in the form of a bonus if it exceeds certain SQR targets.

As a proportion of total airport charges, rebates are up to a total of approximately 2.6 per cent. for departure lounge seat
availability, cleanliness, way-finding, flight information, arrivals baggage carousel and equipment availability, 1.2 per
cent. for infrastructure availability and access, 1.1 per cent. for passenger security queuing times and 1.0 per cent. for
airfield congestion.

Over the six years of Q5 up to 31 March 2014, Heathrow incurred total rebates of £38 million (approximately 0.6 per
cent. of aeronautical income over the period). In the period from 1 April 2014 to 31 December 2018, Heathrow incurred
total rebates of £9 million (approximately 0.1 per cent. of aeronautical income over the period).

**Heathrow’s Licence**

Heathrow’s licence includes a self-modification provision allowing for Heathrow and airlines to agree immediate
changes to the SQRB scheme and for the CAA to act as arbiter if the parties cannot reach agreement on the proposed
changes.

Heathrow’s licence for Q6 includes the price control and SQRB conditions described above. Other key elements of the
licence include:

   - Revocation: Heathrow’s licence will remain in force in perpetuity except for certain limited circumstances in
which the licence may be revoked such as where the licence is no longer required or continued lack of
compliance by Heathrow in relation to regulatory requirements.

   - Financial resilience: the licence contains the following financial resilience conditions:

    - a restriction on business activities that prohibits Heathrow from undertaking unrelated business
activities and placing the regulated business at risk which reflects the Permitted Business restriction in
the Common Terms Agreement;

    - a requirement on the directors of Heathrow to provide an annual certificate on the adequacy of
resources to continue to provide airport operation services at Heathrow Airport for the following 2
years;

    - an undertaking from FGP Topco Limited, Heathrow’s ultimate parent company, not to do anything
that would put Heathrow in breach of its licence;

    - a requirement for Heathrow to put in place a continuity of service plan;

    - a requirement for Heathrow to provide prior written notice to the CAA if it intends to amend its
financing arrangements in respect of credit rating requirements; and

    - an obligation on Heathrow to notify the CAA in the event of Heathrow (or any company within its
group where the financial position of that company or its inability to continue to trade would have an
adverse effect on Heathrow’s financial position or ability to continue to trade) seeking advice from an
insolvency practitioner or any other person relating to Heathrow’s financial position or ability to
continue to trade.

   - Operational resilience: The licence includes a condition relating to the need to secure the availability and
continuity of airport operation services, particularly in times of disruption.

   - Procurement: The licence includes a condition requiring Heathrow to ensure its procurement of capital projects
is efficient and economical, and that it must publish its policies and procedures on how it will achieve this.

   - Planning and delivery of capital projects: The CAA noted in its notice granting the licence in February 2014
that it has identified a possible need for a new licence condition. The new licence condition, relating to the
planning and delivery of capital projects possibly putting greater accountability on Heathrow to ensure
efficient delivery and engagement with the airline community, is to be developed when the licence is in place.
To date, the CAA has not initiated work on a possible new licence condition.

**AERODROME LICENCES**

Heathrow is subject to aerodrome licensing, which requires the operator to demonstrate that it is competent to conduct
aerodrome operations safely.

LON54468925 73


-----

The CAA must grant a licence in respect of any aerodrome in the UK if it is satisfied that:

   - the applicant is competent, having regard to its previous conduct and experience, equipment, organisation,
staffing, maintenance and other arrangements, to secure that the aerodrome and the airspace within which its
visual traffic pattern is normally contained are safe for use by aircraft; and

   - the aerodrome is safe for use by aircraft, having regard in particular to the physical characteristics of the
aerodrome and of its surroundings.

Heathrow has an aerodrome licence for Heathrow Airport.

In mid-2016, Heathrow completed its transition from an aerodrome licence for Heathrow Airport to a certificate issued
in accordance with the new European Aviation Safety Agency’s (“EASA”) regime. The EASA regime allows National
Aviation Authorities (“NAAs”) and airports to convert their existing aerodrome licences to the new EASA certificate.
The CAA will still be the primary regulatory point of contact for Heathrow Airport. It will remain the CAA’s
responsibility to conduct audits of the airport in its capacity as an NAA. However, EASA may conduct audits of the
CAA (and other NAAs) to ensure standardisation across member states.

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

**£250 MILLION NOTES DUE 2025, £275 MILLION NOTES DUE 2027 AND £300 MILLION NOTES DUE**
**2024**

On 16 October 2014, the Issuer issued £250 million 5.75 per cent. Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”).
On 8 June 2017, the Issuer issued £275 million 3.875 per cent. Senior Secured Notes due 2027 (the “2027 Notes”). On
7 November 2018, the Issuer issued £300 million 4.750 per cent. Senior Secured Notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”).
The 2024 Notes, the 2025 Notes and the 2027 Notes are governed by terms and conditions which are identical in all
material respects to the terms and conditions of the Notes except as to interest, maturity and the treatment of finance and
capital leases as Financial Indebtedness. The 2024 Notes, the 2025 Notes and the 2027 Notes are secured by fixed and
floating security over substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and of Heathrow (DSH) Limited (including the issued
share capital of the Issuer and Security Parent) as described below under “Security”.

**ISSUER FACILITIES**

The Issuer currently has in place nine loan facility agreements in respect of (i) facilities of £50 million with a final
maturity in 2022 (the “2014 Issuer Facility”); (ii) facilities of £125 million with various maturities up to 2026 (the
“2016 Issuer Facility 1”) (iii) a facility of £150 million maturing in 2028 (the “2016 Issuer Facility 2”), iv) a facility
of £75 million maturing in 2024 (the “2017 Issuer Facility”), (v) a facility of £260 million with various maturities up to
2028 (the “2018 Issuer Facility 1”); (vi) a facility of £151.8 million with various maturities up to 2031 (the “2018
**Issuer Facility 2”), (vii) a facility of £250 million maturing in 2031 (the “2019 Issuer Facility 1”), (viii) a facility of**
£200 million maturing in 2035 (the “2019 Issuer Facility 2”) and (ix) a facility of £100 million maturing in 2035 (the
“2019 Issuer Facility 3” and (i), (ii), (iii) ), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii), (viii), and (ix) together, the “Issuer Facilities”). The
Royal Bank of Scotland plc and Lloyds Bank plc act as agents (as appropriate) and Deutsche Trustee Company Limited

The Issuer Facilities are secured by fixed and floating security over substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and of
Heathrow (DSH) Limited (including the issued share capital of the Issuer and Security Parent) as described below under
“Security”.

**Repayments and Prepayments**

Subject to certain conditions (including, in certain cases, the payment of a make-whole amount to the relevant lenders),
the Issuer may voluntarily prepay and/or permanently cancel all or part (being a minimum amount of £10,000,000) of
the loans or available commitments (as appropriate) under the Issuer Facilities by giving prior notice to the agent.
Amounts that are permanently prepaid may not be reborrowed.

The 2014 Issuer Facility, the 2016 Issuer Facility 1 and the 2018 Issuer Facility 1 also permit the Issuer to voluntarily
prepay on a temporary basis all or part (being a minimum amount of £10,000,000) of the loans outstanding under such
facilities by giving three business days’ prior notice to the agent (the “Repayment Option”). In respect of the 2014
Issuer Facility, the Repayment Option may only be exercised by the Issuer in respect of Facility A and Facility B and
only once (in the case of Facility A) and twice (in the case of Facility B). The Repayment Option applies to all of the
facilities under the 2016 Issuer Facility 1 and the 2018 Issuer Facility 1 and may not be exercised more than twice in
respect of each facility outstanding under the 2016 Issuer Facility 1 and the 2018 Issuer Facility 1. If the Repayment
Option is exercised by the Issuer, the amounts repaid must be reborrowed by the Issuer within six-months of the
relevant repayment date. During the period in which a facility is repaid, a commitment fee will accrue on the repaid
amount.

In addition to voluntary prepayments, the Issuer Facilities require mandatory cancellation and, if applicable, prepayment
(or, as the case may be, an offer to do so) in full or in part in certain circumstances, including:

- with respect to any lender, if it is or will become unlawful for such lender to perform any of its obligations
under the Issuer Facilities; and

- upon the occurrence of a sale of the whole or substantially all of the Group’s business and assets.

Upon a change of control, the Issuer must notify the agent of such change of control. If there is a change of control,
each lender may elect to cancel its commitments immediately and declare all amounts owing to it under the Issuer
Facilities due and payable immediately.

**Interest and Margins**

Loans under the Issuer Facilities bear interest either (i) at floating rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus the applicable
margin or (ii) at a fixed rate per annum.

LON54468925 78

per annum to 3.75 per cent. per annum. Where the Issuer Facilities bear interest on a fixed basis, the fixed rate is in the
range of 4.80 per cent. per annum to 5.30 per cent. per annum.

**INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT**

**General**

The Issuer and Heathrow (DSH) Limited have entered into an intercreditor agreement (the “Intercreditor
**Agreement”) with, among others, the security agent, the agents under the Issuer Facilities, the trustee for the 2024**
Notes, the trustee for the 2025 Notes, the trustee for the 2027 Notes and any hedging creditors. The Trustee will accede
to the Intercreditor Agreement on or about the issue date of the Notes.

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the term “Secured Parties” is defined to mean the security agent, the agents,
arrangers and lenders under the Issuer Facilities, the Trustee in its capacity as trustee for the holders of the Notes, the
holders of the 2024 Notes and the holders of the 2025 Notes and the holders of the 2027 Notes, the purchasers under the
2030 PP, any hedging creditor, any future secured creditor which has acceded as a party to the Intercreditor Agreement
in the relevant capacity and any receiver or delegate appointed by the security agent pursuant to any of the security
documents.

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law.

The Intercreditor Agreement includes terms that establish:

- the ranking and priority of the liabilities owed to the lenders under the Issuer Facilities, to the Trustee in its
capacity as the trustee for the holders of the Notes, the holders of the 2024 Notes and the holders of the 2025
Notes and the holders of the 2027 Notes, to the hedging creditors and to Heathrow (DSH) Limited with respect
to liabilities owed by the Issuer to Heathrow (DSH) Limited (“Parent Liabilities”);

- the basis on which the security agent is appointed to hold the collateral created by the security documents;

- under what circumstances the security documents may be enforced;

- the application of proceeds from an enforcement in respect of the collateral; and

- under which circumstances the collateral may be shared on a _pari passu basis with additional third party_
creditors.

**Priority of Secured Obligations**

The Intercreditor Agreement purports to rank (in right and priority of payment) the debt held by the Secured Parties
under the Issuer Facilities, the trust deed for the 2024 Notes, the trust deed for the 2025 Notes, the trust deed for the
2027 Notes, the Trust Deed, from November 2018 the 2018 Note Purchase Agreement and the hedging agreements (the
“Secured Obligations”), together with the collateral that secures such Secured Obligations, _pari passu without any_
preference between any such class of Secured Obligations.

**Incremental and Refinancing Debt**

The Intercreditor Agreement permits certain additional secured debt, including any debt which is raised pursuant to
additional credit facilities and additional bonds or notes issued by the Issuer and which are permitted under the terms of
the Issuer Facilities, the trust deed for the 2024 Notes, the trust deed for the 2025 Notes, the trust deed for the 2027
Notes, upon accession, the terms of the 2018 Note Purchase Agreement and the Trust Deed to share in the collateral and
rank pari passu alongside the other Secured Obligations.

**Prohibited Actions**

The Intercreditor Agreement does not limit the making of:

- payments, distributions or other actions in respect of the Secured Obligations;

LON54468925 81


-----

- payments (including in respect of scheduled interest and principal) in respect of the Secured Obligations under
the Trust Deed; and

- payments in respect of the Secured Obligations under the hedging agreements (subject to certain restrictions as
set out in the Intercreditor Agreement),

in each case, in accordance with terms of the documents governing the relevant class of Secured Obligations.

Following the occurrence of certain acceleration and/or insolvency events all payments in respect of Secured
Obligations must be applied in accordance with the payment waterfall set out in the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement prohibits Parent Liabilities from receiving the benefit of any security, guarantee,
indemnity or other assurance against loss and, prior to the final discharge of all obligations under the Secured
Obligations or an insolvency event, prohibits the taking of any enforcement action by the Parent with respect to Parent
Liabilities.

**Enforcement of Security Documents**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that only the security agent will have the right to enforce the security documents.

Under the Intercreditor Agreement and subject to the security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms,
the security agent shall determine the nature, management, timing and control of any enforcement of the security
documents on the instructions of the Secured Parties who, in the aggregate, hold more than 50 per cent. of the amounts
under the Issuer Facilities (and certain additional credit facilities), any hedging arrangements and the Notes then
outstanding (including certain additional notes) (the “Majority Primary Creditors”). In the absence of such
instructions, the security agent shall act as it sees fit.

The security agent will not be liable in any respect to any Secured Party or any other person for exercising (or failing to
exercise) any of its rights, powers or discretions in relation to the security documents. The security agent may disregard
any instructions to enforce any security if those instructions are inconsistent with the Intercreditor Agreement.

**Snooze/Lose**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that if in relation to a request for a consent to participate in a vote or to approve
any other action or provide any confirmation or notification under the Intercreditor Agreement, the agent under the
Issuer Facilities, the Trustee (in its capacity as trustee for the holders of the Notes, the holders of the 2024 Notes, the
holders of the 2025 Notes or the holders of the 2027 Notes), upon accession, the purchasers under the 2030 PP or a
hedge counterparty (each, for itself and on behalf of the creditors it represents) fails to respond to that request within 20
business days of the request being made, the consent or vote of such party (and the aggregate principal amount of
indebtedness represented by such party) shall be disregarded for the purposes of ascertaining whether an agreement has
been obtained, a vote carried or another action approved, and, in the case of any confirmation or notification, that
confirmation or notification will be deemed to have been given.

**Enforcement Proceeds**

The Intercreditor Agreement regulates the order in which amounts received by the security agent (including upon
enforcement of the collateral) are distributed to the Secured Parties.

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the parties agree that, following any enforcement of the security documents, the
claims of the security agent, any receiver or delegate appointed by the security agent pursuant to any of the security
documents will have first ranking claims (without any priority between themselves), followed by the costs and expenses
of any Secured Party (including the Trustee and the agents) incurred in realisation or enforcement of the security
documents, and then followed by claims in respect of the obligations under the Issuer Facilities, the obligations under
the trust deed for the 2024 Notes, the obligations under the trust deed for the 2025 Notes, the obligations under the trust
deed for the 2027 Notes, the Trust Deed, the obligations under the 2030 PP the obligations of any hedging creditor and
the obligations under any other additional bonds or additional credit facilities permitted under the Trust Deed and the
Intercreditor Agreement ranking pari passu and pro rata according to the respective amounts among themselves, and
finally followed by any claim which the security agent is obliged to pay in priority to the Issuer or Heathrow (DSH)
Limited. The balance (if any) will be paid to the Issuer and Heathrow (DSH) Limited. The security agent will apply
amounts received following enforcement, including recoveries from enforcement, in accordance with this priority.

The Intercreditor Agreement contains customary turnover provisions.

**Appointment of Security Agent**

The Intercreditor Agreement sets out the terms on which the security agent holds the benefit of the security documents.

LON54468925 82


-----

The security agent shall not be obliged to take any action (including with respect to taking enforcement proceedings or
enforcing the security documents) unless indemnified, secured or prepaid to its satisfaction. The security agent shall be
entitled to accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of banking or other business with
either the Issuer or Heathrow (DSH) Limited.

Unless acting on the instruction of the Majority Primary Creditors, or exercising certain specific discretions granted to it
under the Intercreditor Agreement, in exercising any discretion to exercise a right, power or authority under the
Intercreditor Agreement, the security agent shall do so having regard to the interests of all the Secured Parties.

The security agent is not obliged to insure any collateral, or require any other person to maintain such insurance, and
will not be responsible for any loss, expense or liability which may be suffered as a result of the lack of, or inadequacy
of, such insurance. Each Secured Party (other than the security agent) is responsible for undertaking its own
independent appraisal and investigation of all risks arising under or in connection with the Intercreditor Agreement and
related documents, including in respect of the financial condition, status and nature of each member of the Group and
the title of any security provider to the collateral. Neither the security agent nor any receiver or delegate shall be liable
for (among other things) validity, effectiveness, adequacy or enforceability of the collateral.

**Release of Transaction Security**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the security agent may release the collateral (and the obligations of the
obligors) under certain conditions, including in connection with the enforcement of the security documents or in
connection with the sale or disposal of assets permitted by each relevant financing document.

**Common Security**

None of the lenders under the Issuer Facilities, the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes, the holders of the 2024
Notes, the holders of the 2025 Notes and the holders of the 2027 Notes, the purchasers under the 2030 PP, or the
hedging creditors may take the benefit of any security or guarantees in respect of their respective Secured Obligations
other than under the relevant financing documents and the security documents.

**Amendments**

The security agent, the Issuer and Heathrow (DSH) Limited each has the right to make amendments which are minor or
of a technical nature to the Intercreditor Agreement without any further consent from the Secured Parties. Other
amendments or waivers of the Intercreditor Agreement may be made only with the consent of the agent under each
Issuer Facility, the Trustee as representative of the holders of the Notes, the 2024 Notes, the 2025 Notes and the 2027
Notes, the purchasers under the 2030 PP, the trustee or agent under any additional bonds or additional credit facilities
permitted by the Trust Deed and the Intercreditor, the security agent and Heathrow (DSH) Limited, except that any
amendment, waiver or consent that only affects the rights and obligations of certain parties (and which could not
reasonably be expected to be adverse to the interests of the other parties) requires the consent only of the parties so
affected. Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the security agent may—if so instructed by the Majority Primary
Creditors, and if Heathrow (DSH) Limited consents—amend the terms of, waive requirements of or grant consents
under any of the relevant security documents, provided that for releases of security, claims or liabilities or any consents
given by the security agent in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, any amendment, waiver or consent related
to the security documents which affects the nature or scope of the security or the manner in which the proceeds of
enforcement of the security are distributed requires the prior consent of the Secured Parties.

**SENIOR BORROWER GROUP INDEBTEDNESS**

As at 30 September 2019, the Senior Borrower Group had indebtedness totalling £13,924 million under revolving credit
facilities (the “RCF”), a revolving working capital facility, a liquidity facility (the “Senior Borrower Liquidity
**Facility”), term loans from the European Investment Bank, other term debt (together, the “Authorised Senior Credit**
**Facilities” and each an “Authorised Senior Credit Facility”) and borrower loan agreements between Heathrow and**
Heathrow Funding Limited, which correspond in their terms to each series of bonds (the “Senior Bonds”) issued by
Heathrow Funding Limited (the “Borrower Loan Agreements” and, together with the Authorised Senior Credit
Facilities, the “Senior Borrower Group Indebtedness”). The Senior Borrower Group can issue senior ranking debt
(“Senior Debt”) and junior ranking debt (“Junior Debt”).

The Senior Borrower Group Indebtedness is secured by substantially all the assets of each of the members of the Senior
Borrower Group (the “Senior Obligors” and each a “Senior Obligor”) and guarantees by each Senior Obligor in
respect of each other’s obligations, in favour of the lenders under the Senior Borrower Group Indebtedness (the “Senior
**Borrower Secured Creditors”). In addition, Heathrow Funding Limited as issuer of the Senior Bonds provided**
security over substantially all of its assets in favour of the trustee under the Senior Bonds and holders of the Senior
Bonds.

LON54468925 83


-----

A common terms agreement (the **CTA ) sets out the common warranties, covenants, trigger events or loan events of**
default applicable to the Senior Borrower Group Indebtedness. The Senior Borrower Secured Creditors have also
entered into intercreditor arrangements, contained in a security trust and intercreditor deed (the “STID”). These are
described below.

If the Senior Borrower Group fails to make payments or comply with the covenants in respect of its financing, this may
result in a default under the Senior Borrower Group financing and the insolvency of the Senior Borrower Group. The
Notes will be subordinated to all liabilities of the Senior Borrower Group and so in such circumstances the Issuer’s
ability to make payments under the Notes would be severely restricted and there might be no returns in relation to the
Notes.

**CTA**

**_General_**

The CTA sets out certain representations, covenants, Trigger Events and Loan Events of Default which apply to each
Authorised Senior Credit Facility including the Borrower Loan Agreements. A copy of the CTA is available ono the
Heathrow Airport Holdings Group’s website and is incorporated by reference in this Prospectus.

**_Covenants_**

The covenants are positive, negative, informational and financial in nature. They include an undertaking by LHR
Airports Limited as agent of the Senior Borrower Group (the “Senior Borrower Group Agent”) to provide consolidated
audited financial statements of the Senior Borrower Group and Heathrow Funding Limited for each financial year and
consolidated, unaudited financial information for the financial half-year.

The Senior Borrower Group Agent must also supply an Investor Report by 30 June and 31 December each year which
includes a general update on the Senior Borrower Group, regulatory and business developments and capital expenditure.

Each Senior Obligor has undertaken not to incur any Financial Indebtedness other than Permitted Financial
Indebtedness. The incurrence of additional Senior Debt or Junior Debt is subject to certain conditions including that the
Senior RAR, the ratio of Senior Debt to the total RAB must be less than 0.725 and the Junior RAR, the ratio of Junior
Debt to the total RAB must be less than 0.90, in each case calculated taking account of the proposed additional
Financial Indebtedness. In addition, there are provisions which restrict the amount of Financial Indebtedness which can
fall due (a) within any 24-month period to 30 per cent. of total RAB and (b) within any Five Year Period to 50 per cent.
of total RAB.

Heathrow cannot be sold without approval from the requisite majority of qualifying Senior Borrower Secured Creditors.

In addition to the restrictions on financial indebtedness and disposals, the CTA also contains a number of covenants
which regulate the Senior Obligors’ activities including, among others:

(1) limitations on non-permitted business;

(2) limitations on joint ventures;

(3) a negative pledge; and

(4) a requirement to comply with specified insurance and outsourcing policies.

**_Trigger Events_**

The CTA sets out certain trigger events including:

(1) any breach of the following financial ratios:

(A) the Senior RAR as at any Relevant Date is, or estimated to be, more than 0.725;

(B) the Junior RAR as at any Relevant Date is, or is estimated to be, more than 0.85;

(C) the Senior ICR for each Relevant Period is, or is estimated to be, less than 1.40; or

(D) the Junior ICR for each Relevant Period is, or is estimated to be, less than 1.20;

(2) credit rating downgrades on the Class A Bonds issued by Heathrow Funding Limited below BBB+;

(3) a credit rating downgrade of Class B Bonds issued by Heathrow Funding Limited below BBB-;

LON54468925 84


-----

(4) the commencement of the final reading of draft legislation in the House of Lords or the House of Commons
(whichever occurs later) relating to the business of any Senior Obligor if such legislation could (if enacted)
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

(5) forecast Capital Expenditure over the 12 month period following a Calculation Date exceeds the aggregate of
undrawn RCF, cash and Projected Excess Cashflow Before Capex over such 12 month period;

(6) the amount available under the Issuer Liquidity Facilities/any cash liquidity reserve is less than the estimated
interest and equivalent finance charges for (a) the 12 month period following a Calculation Date in respect of
Issuer Senior Debt and (b) the six month period following a Calculation Date in respect of Issuer Junior Debt;

(7) the issue of any compliance or enforcement order by any Regulator which would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect; or

(8) the issue of a termination notice or a notice of any proposed or actual modification in respect of any licence by
a Regulator which, if implemented, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

The occurrence of a Trigger Event gives rise to various consequences including a block on Restricted Payments, the
preparation of remedial plans and a termination plan in respect of the Shared Services Agreement, and a right for the
security trustee under the Senior Borrower Group Indebtedness to request to participate in discussions with the
Regulator.

**_Loan Events of Default_**

The CTA contains a number of Loan Events of Default (subject, in some cases, to agreed exceptions, materiality
qualifications, reservations of law and grace periods) including:

(1) non-payment by a Senior Obligor of amounts payable under the Finance Documents;

(2) a breach of the following financial ratios:

(A) if the Senior RAR as stated in the compliance certificate produced in respect of the reporting date
falling in June in respect of 31 December of the preceding financial year is more than 0.925; and/or

(B) if the Average Senior ICR as stated in the compliance certificate produced in respect of the reporting
date falling in June is less than 1.05;

(3) non-compliance with any term of any covenant or undertaking in any Finance Document;

(4) a representation made or repeated by a Senior Obligor in any Finance Document being incorrect or misleading
in any material respect when made or deemed to be repeated;

(5) the insolvency of a Senior Obligor;

(6) it becoming unlawful for any Senior Obligor to perform its obligations under any transaction document;

(7) certain changes in law; or

(8) the occurrence of an event of default under the Senior Bonds.

In respect of each Loan Event of Default requiring any action or discretion on the part of the relevant creditor, the
security trustee under the Senior Borrower will act in accordance with the relevant provisions of the STID.

**_Hedging Policy_**

The Senior Borrower are subject to a Hedging Policy which is set out at Schedule 5 of the CTA. The Senior Borrowers
have entered into and in the future may enter into various interest rate, inflation-linked and currency hedging
transactions in conformity with the Hedging Policy.

**_Security Trust and Intercreditor Deed (“STID”)_**

The intercreditor arrangements among the Senior Borrower Secured Creditors of the Senior Borrower Group (the
“Senior **Intercreditor Arrangements”) are contained in the STID, Creditors of debt not secured by the collateral**
securing the liabilities under the CTA are not and will not become parties to the Senior Intercreditor Arrangements and
will not be subject to their terms. However, the aggregate amount of such Financial Indebtedness is restricted under the
CTA.

The purpose of the Senior Intercreditor Arrangements is to regulate, among other things: (i) the claims of the Senior
Borrower Secured Creditors and their ranking in point of payment after the delivery of a Loan Enforcement Notice; (ii)

LON54468925 85


-----

the exercise, acceleration and enforcement of rights by the Senior Borrower Secured Creditors; (iii) the rights of the
Senior Borrower Secured Creditors to instruct the security trustee under the Senior Borrower Group Indebtedness; and
(iv) the giving of consents and waivers and the making of modifications to the CTA, the Security Documents, the
Shared Services Agreement, the STID, the Master Definitions Agreement and the Tax Deed of Covenant (the
“Common Documents”). The Senior Intercreditor Arrangements provide for the subordination and postponement of all
claims in respect of Financial Indebtedness of any Heathrow Airport Holdings Group company or Affiliate thereof that
is not a member of the Senior Borrower Group and following delivery of a Loan Acceleration Notice, payments under
the Shared Services Agreement and certain other contracts otherwise entered into in accordance with the CTA.

As regards the giving of consents and waivers and the making of modifications in relation to the Common Documents,
the STID contains provisions which enable the security trustee under the Senior Borrower Group Indebtedness to give
or permit the making thereof in certain circumstances (principally where it determines that the consent, waiver or
modification will not be materially prejudicial to Senior Borrower Secured Creditors. Where the security trustee under
the Senior Borrower is not willing or able to exercise its discretion, approval from relevant qualifying Senior Borrower
Secured Creditors is required. Consents, waivers or modifications may, depending on their nature, constitute Ordinary
Voting Matters or Extraordinary Voting Matters. In addition, they may constitute an Entrenched Right in respect of one
or more Senior Borrower Secured Creditors, with the result that the consent of such Senior Borrower Secured Creditors
will need to be obtained.

Voting is effected on a “one pound equals one vote” basis, except that, in the case of bank debt, the entirety of the
relevant outstanding bank debt will vote in accordance with the instructions given by the relevant majority of the bank
lenders in respect of such debt.

There are also provisions which enable instructions to be given to the security trustee under the Senior Borrower Group
Indebtedness by the required percentage of Qualifying Senior Borrower Secured Creditors in relation to a number of
matters including whether to enforce the security following a Loan Event of Default and whether to deliver a Loan
Acceleration Notice.

With exceptions, the Senior Borrowers are generally free to pay debts as they fall due, whether they be in respect of
Senior Debt or Junior Debt, or in respect of unsecured claims. There are, however, priorities of payments which
regulate payments made after the delivery of a Loan Enforcement Notice and after the delivery of a Loan Acceleration
Notice. In addition, the making of certain payments following a Loan Event of Default is regulated.

may redeem all or some only of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100 per cent. of the principal
amount thereof plus if the redemption date occurs more than 3 months prior to the Maturity Date, the
Applicable Redemption Premium and, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but
excluding the redemption date.

In connection with any redemption of any Notes under this Condition 7.2(a), any such redemption
may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent including, but not
limited to, a financing condition. If any such redemption is subject to satisfaction of one or more
conditions precedent, the notice of redemption may state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the
redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or
such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such
conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed.

The Issuer will publish a notice of any optional redemption of the Notes under this Condition in
accordance with the provisions of Condition 20 (Notices).

If fewer than all the Notes are to be redeemed at any time pursuant to this paragraph (a) the Issuer will
select the Notes by a method that complies with the requirements of the principal securities exchange,
if any, on which the Notes are listed at such time or, if the Notes are not listed on a securities
exchange, by such method as the Trustee in its sole discretion shall deem fair and appropriate;
provided, however, that no such partial redemption shall reduce the portion of the principal amount of
a Note not redeemed to less than £100,000. The Trustee shall not be liable for any selections made in
accordance with this paragraph.

(b) **_Redemption Upon Changes in Withholding Taxes._** The Notes may be redeemed at their principal
amount, together with interest accrued to but excluding the date of redemption at the option of the
Issuer in whole, but not in part, at any time, on giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice
to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 20 (Notices) (which notice shall be irrevocable), if
the Issuer satisfies the Trustee immediately prior to giving such notice that:

(i) it has or will on the occasion of the next payment due in respect of the Notes become obliged
to pay Additional Amounts as provided or referred to in Condition 10 (Taxation) as a result
of any change in, or amendment to, the laws or regulations of the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction, or any change in the published application or official interpretation of such laws
or regulations, which change or amendment becomes effective on or after the date of the
Trust Deed; and

(ii) such obligation cannot be avoided by the Issuer taking reasonable measures available to it,
_provided_ that no such notice of redemption shall be given earlier than 90 days prior to the
earliest date on which the Issuer would be obliged to pay such Additional Amounts were a
payment in respect of the Notes then due.

Prior to the publication of any notice of redemption pursuant to this paragraph (b):

recognised standing to the effect that the Issuer has or will become obliged to pay
such Additional Amounts as a result of such change or amendment; and

(B) the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the
obligation referred to in paragraph (b)(i) above cannot be avoided by the Issuer
taking reasonable measures available to it,

LON54468925 94

and the Trustee shall be entitled to accept such opinion as sufficient evidence of the
satisfaction of the condition precedent set out in paragraph (b)(i) above, and such certificate
as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the condition precedent set out in
paragraph (b)(ii) above and such opinion and certificate (if accepted) shall be conclusive and
binding on the Noteholders and the Couponholders.

7.3 _Purchase of Notes Upon a Change of Control_

(a) If a Change of Control occurs at any time, then the Issuer must make an offer (a “Change of Control
**Offer”) to each Noteholder to purchase such holder’s Notes, at a purchase price (the “Change of**
**Control Purchase Price”) in cash in an amount equal to 101 per cent. of the principal amount**
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase described in paragraph (b)
below (the “Change of Control Purchase Date”).

(b) Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will publish a notice of the Change of
Control Offer in accordance with Condition 20 (Notices) (the date of publication of such notice being
the “Publication Date”), specifying the nature of the Change of Control and the procedure for
exercising the option contained in this Condition 7.3, including (i) the Change of Control Purchase
Price and (ii) the Change of Control Purchase Date, which will be a Business Day no earlier than 30
days nor later than 60 days from the Publication Date, or such later date as is necessary to comply
with requirements under any applicable securities laws or regulations.

To exercise the option to require purchase of a Note under this Condition, a Noteholder must deliver
such Note, on any banking business day in the place of delivery prior to the Change of Control
Purchase Date (the “Put Period”) at the specified office of any Paying Agent, accompanied by a duly
signed and completed notice of exercise in the form (for the time being current) obtainable from the
specified office of any Paying Agent (a “Put Notice”) and in which the Noteholder may specify a
bank account complying with the requirements of Condition 8 (Payments) to which payment is to be
made under this Condition. Notes should be delivered together with all Coupons appertaining thereto
maturing after the date (the “Put Date”), which is seven days after the expiration of the Put Period,
failing which deduction in respect of such missing unmatured Coupons shall be made in accordance
with Condition 8 (Payments) and any amount so deducted will be reimbursed in the manner specified
in Condition 8 (Payments). The Paying Agent to which such Note and Put Notice are delivered will
issue to the Noteholder concerned a non-transferable receipt in respect of the Note so delivered. If the
Put Date is an Interest Payment Date, payment of the accrued interest in respect of any Note so
delivered will be made in the manner provided in Condition 8 (Payments) against presentation and
surrender of the relevant Coupon. If the Put Date is not an Interest Payment Date, payment of the
accrued interest, and in all cases, payment of principal in respect of any Note so delivered will be
made, if the Noteholder duly specified a bank account in the Put Notice to which payment is to be
made, on the Put Date by transfer to that bank account and in every other case on or after the Put Date
against presentation and surrender or (as the case may be) endorsement of such receipt at the specified
office of any Paying Agent in accordance with Condition 8 (Payments). A Put Notice, once given,
shall be irrevocable. For all relevant purposes of these Conditions, receipts issued pursuant to this
Condition shall be treated as if they were Notes. The Issuer shall purchase (or procure the purchase
of) the relevant Notes on the Put Date unless previously redeemed or purchased and cancelled.

(c) The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if a third party makes the Change
of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set
forth in these Conditions applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and offers to
purchase all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. The
Change of Control provisions of this Condition will be applicable whether or not any other provisions
of the Trust Deed are applicable.

(d) To the extent the Issuer complies with applicable tender offer rules and any other applicable securities
laws and regulations and such rules, laws and regulations conflict with the provisions of this
Condition 7.3, the Issuer will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Condition and
the Trust Deed by virtue of such conflict.

7.4 _Sinking Fund; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases; Cancellation of Notes_

(a) The Issuer is not required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect
to the Notes.

(b) The Issuer and any of its Subsidiaries may at any time purchase Notes in the open market or otherwise
at any price (provided that they are purchased together with all unmatured Coupons relating to them).

LON54468925 95


-----

(c) All Notes so redeemed or purchased and any unmatured Coupons attached to or surrendered with
them may, but need not, be cancelled at the election of the Issuer. Any Notes or Coupons so cancelled
will not be re-issued or resold.

(d) Where Notes redeemed pursuant to this Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase) are cancelled upon
redemption, any unmatured Coupons appertaining to such Notes, whether or not attached thereto or
surrendered therewith, shall also be cancelled and may not be resold or re-issued.

**8.** **PAYMENTS**

(a) Payments of principal and premium (if any) and payments of interest due on each Interest Payment
Date will be made against presentation and surrender (or, in the case of a partial payment,
endorsement) of Notes or the appropriate Coupons (as the case may be) at the specified office of any
Paying Agent by Sterling cheque drawn on, or by transfer to a Sterling account maintained by the
payee with, a bank in London. Payments of interest due in respect of any Note other than on an
Interest Payment Date shall be made only against presentation and either surrender or endorsement (as
appropriate) of the relevant Note.

(b) All payments are subject in all cases to any applicable fiscal or other laws and regulations, but without
prejudice to the provisions of Condition 10 (Taxation). No commissions or expenses shall be charged
to the Noteholders or Couponholders in respect of such payments.

(c) Each Note should be presented for payment together with all unmatured Coupons relating to it, failing
which the full amount of any such missing unmatured Coupon (or, in the case of payment not being
made in full, that proportion of the full amount of such missing unmatured Coupon which the amount
so paid bears to the total amount due) will be deducted from the amount due for payment. Each
amount so deducted will be paid in the manner mentioned above against presentation and surrender
(or, in the case of part payment only, endorsement) of such missing Coupon at any time before the
expiry of ten years after the relevant payment date in respect of the relevant Note (whether or not the
Coupon would otherwise have become void pursuant to Condition 9 (Prescription)) or, if later, five
years after the date on which the Coupon would have become due, but not thereafter.

(d) A Note or Coupon may only be presented for payment on a day which is a banking business day in
the relevant place of presentation (and, in the case of payment by transfer to a Sterling account, in
London). No further interest or other payment will be made as a consequence of the day on which the
relevant Note or Coupon may be presented for payment under this paragraph (d) falling after the due
date.

(e) The initial Paying Agent and its initial specified offices are listed below. The Issuer reserves the right,
subject to the prior written approval of the Trustee, at any time to vary or terminate the appointment
of any Paying Agent and to appoint additional or other Paying Agents; provided that they will at all
times maintain:

(i) a Principal Paying Agent; and

(ii) so long as the Notes are listed on any stock exchange or admitted to listing by any other
relevant authority, a Paying Agent with a specified office in such place as may be required
by the rules and regulations of the relevant stock exchange or such other relevant authority.

The initial specified office of the initial Paying Agent is:

Winchester House, 1 Great Winchester Street, London EC2N 2DB.

Notice of any change in the Paying Agents or their specified offices will promptly be given to the
Noteholders by the Issuer in accordance with Condition 20 (Notices).

In acting under the Agency Agreement, the Paying Agents act solely as agents of the Issuer and, in
certain limited circumstances specified therein, of the Trustee and do not assume any obligation to, or
relationship of agency or trust with, the Noteholders or the Couponholders. The Agency Agreement
contains provisions permitting any entity into which any Paying Agent is merged or converted or with
which it is consolidated or to which it transfers all or substantially all of its assets to become the
successor paying agent.

**9.** **PRESCRIPTION**

(a) Claims in respect of principal and premium will become void unless the relevant Notes are presented
for payment within a period of ten years from the appropriate payment date.

LON54468925 96


-----

(b) Claims for interest in respect of Notes shall become void unless the relevant Coupons are presented
for payment within five years of the relevant Interest Payment Date, subject to the provisions of
paragraph (c) of Condition 8 (Payments).

**10.** **TAXATION**

All payments by or on behalf of the Issuer under or with respect to the Notes will be made free and clear of and
without withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future Tax imposed or levied on such
payments by or within the United Kingdom or by or within any department, political subdivision or
governmental authority of or in the United Kingdom having power to tax (each, a “Relevant Taxing
**Jurisdiction”), unless the Issuer is required to withhold or deduct Taxes by law. In that event, the Issuer will**
pay additional amounts (“Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount received
by each Noteholder and Couponholder after such withholding or deduction (including any withholding or
deduction in respect of any Additional Amounts) will not be less than the amount the Noteholder or
Couponholder, as the case may be, would have received if such Taxes had not been withheld or deducted.

The Issuer will not, however, pay Additional Amounts in respect of any Note or Coupon:

(a) held by or on behalf of a holder who is liable to such Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or
levied by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction by reason of the holder’s present or former connection with
such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (other than the mere receipt, ownership, holding or disposition of
Notes or Coupons, or by reason of the receipt of any payments in respect of any Note or Coupon, or
the exercise or enforcement of rights under any Notes or Coupons);

(b) held by or on behalf of a holder who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by
presenting any form or certificate, or by making a declaration of non-residence or other claim for
exemption to the relevant tax authority; or

(c) presented for payment more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available to the
Noteholder or Couponholder (except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30-day period).

The Issuer will (i) make such withholding or deduction as is required by applicable law and (ii) remit the full
amount deducted or withheld to the relevant authority in accordance with applicable law.

Any reference in these Conditions to any amounts in respect of the Notes shall be deemed also to refer to any
Additional Amounts which may be payable under this Condition or under any undertakings given in addition
to, or in substitution for, this Condition pursuant to the Trust Deed.

If the Issuer becomes subject at any time to any taxing jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom, references
in these Conditions, in respect of payments by the Issuer to the United Kingdom shall be construed as
references to the United Kingdom and/or such other jurisdiction.

**11.** **EVENTS OF DEFAULT**

(a) Each of the following will be an “Event of Default”:

(i) default for 30 days in the payment when due of any interest or any Additional Amounts on
any Note;

(ii) default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, on any Note at its Maturity
(upon acceleration, optional or mandatory redemption, if any, required repurchase or
otherwise);

(iii) failure to comply with the provisions of Condition 4.12 (Merger, _Consolidation and Sale of_
_Substantially All Assets);_

(iv) failure to make or consummate a Change of Control Offer in accordance with the provisions
of Condition 7.3 (Purchase of Notes Upon a Change of Control);

(v) failure to comply with any covenant or agreement of the Issuer or the Parent that is contained
in these Conditions or the Trust Deed (other than specified in paragraph (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv)
above) and such failure continues for a period of 30 days or more after written notice thereof
is given to the Issuer by the Trustee;

(vi) any Financial Indebtedness of any member of the Group:

LON54468925 97


-----

(A) is not paid when due nor within any originally applicable grace period other than a
non-payment of interest in respect of Junior Debt; or

(B) is declared to be or otherwise becomes due and payable prior to its specified
maturity as a result of an event of default (however described).

No Event of Default will occur under paragraph (A) or (B) above in respect of Financial
Indebtedness if the aggregate amount of all Financial Indebtedness falling within
paragraphs (A) and (B) above is less than £50,000,000 (or its equivalent in any other
currency or currencies);

(vii) the Transaction Security ceases to be legal, valid, binding, enforceable or effective for any
reason other than as permitted by these Conditions or is alleged by the Issuer or the Parent to
be invalid or unenforceable;

(viii) any execution proceedings in an aggregate amount in excess of £50,000,000 (or its
equivalent in any other currency or currencies) are enforced in relation to any assets of the
Issuer or any Subsidiary Group Company;

(ix) a moratorium is declared in respect of any Financial Indebtedness in an amount in excess of
£50,000,000 (or its equivalent in any other currency or currencies) of the Issuer or any
Subsidiary Group Company; and

(x) any corporate action, legal proceedings or other legal procedure or formal step is taken in
relation to:

(A) the suspension of payments, a moratorium of any indebtedness, winding-up,
dissolution, administration or reorganisation (by way of voluntary arrangement,
scheme of arrangement or otherwise) of the Issuer or a Subsidiary Group Company
other than a solvent liquidation or reorganisation of any Subsidiary Group
Company;

(B) a composition, compromise, assignment or arrangement with any creditor of the
Issuer or any Subsidiary Group Company; or

(C) the appointment of a liquidator (other than in respect of a solvent liquidation of a
Subsidiary Group Company), receiver, administrative receiver, administrator,
special administrator, compulsory manager or other similar officer in respect of the
Issuer or a Subsidiary Group Company or any of their respective material assets,

or, in the opinion of the Trustee, any analogous procedure or step is taken in any jurisdiction;
_provided, however, that this paragraph (a)(x) shall not apply to: (X) any winding-up petition_
which is frivolous or vexatious and is discharged, stayed or dismissed within 28 days of
commencement or, if earlier, the date on which it is advertised; or (Y) an application for the
appointment of a receiver, administrative receiver, administrator, compulsory manager or
other similar officer that is discharged at least five days prior to the first hearing of that
application.

(b) If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, and, in the case of the Events of Default described
under paragraph (a)(v) (other than in respect of a failure to comply with the covenants set out in
Condition 4.1 (Financial Covenants), Condition 4.2 (Limitation on Financial Indebtedness),
Condition 4.3(a) (Limitation on dividends, share redemption and restricted payments — Restrictions
_on the Issuer), Condition 4.5(a) (Limitation on Loans, Credit or Guarantee — Restrictions on the_
_Issuer), Condition 4.6(a) (Negative Pledge), Condition 4.7 (Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets),_
Condition 4.8 (Restricted _Payment_ _Conditions),_ Condition 4.10 (Holding _Companies),_
Condition 4.11(d) (Information and Reports; Certificates; Notification of Defaults and Events of
_Default) and Condition 4.12 (Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Substantially All Assets)), (a)(vii) or_
(a)(x) above or any Event of Default of the Parent, the Trustee has certified in writing that, in its
opinion, the happening of such event is materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders, the
Trustee:

(i) may in its absolute discretion; and

(ii) shall if it has been directed to do so:

(A) in writing by the holders of not less than 25 per cent. in aggregate of the principal
amount of the Notes outstanding; or

LON54468925 98


-----

(B) by an Extraordinary Resolution of the Noteholders,

subject, in each case, to being indemnified and/or pre-funded and/or secured to its satisfaction, give a
notice (a “Note Acceleration Notice”) to the Issuer and the Security Agent declaring the principal of,
premium, if any, and any Additional Amounts and accrued interest on all the outstanding Notes
immediately due and payable. The ability of the Trustee and the Noteholders to declare, and of the
Noteholders to direct the Trustee to declare, the Notes due and payable is subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

**12.** **ENFORCEMENT OF SECURITY**

(a) At any time after a Note Acceleration Notice has been given to the Issuer, the Trustee:

(i) may in its absolute discretion; and

(ii) shall if it has been directed to do so:

(A) in writing by the holders of not less than 25 per cent. in aggregate of the principal
amount of the Notes outstanding; or

(B) by an Extraordinary Resolution of the Noteholders,

subject in each case to being indemnified and/or pre-funded and/or secured to its satisfaction in
accordance with the Trust Deed, instruct the Security Agent to make a Request for voting in relation
to enforcing the Transaction Security pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (each, a
“Request Instruction”).

(b) The Trustee shall, subject to being indemnified and/or pre-funded and/or secured to its satisfaction in
accordance with the Trust Deed, promptly after receiving any Request in relation to enforcement of
the Transaction Security, give a notice to Noteholders in accordance with Condition 20 (Notices)
soliciting the direction from holders of the Notes then outstanding (each, a “Noteholder Direction”)
to the Trustee as to whether to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action in relation to the
Transaction Security pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement (such instruction, an “Enforcement
**Instruction”). Upon the conclusion of the solicitation of Noteholder Directions, the Trustee shall**
inform the Issuer and the Security Agent promptly in writing of the aggregate principal amount of
Notes represented by the holders of Notes voting in favour of the Enforcement Instruction, if any.

(c) Any enforcement of the Transaction Security will be undertaken by the Security Agent, subject to,
and in accordance with, the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**13.** **NOTEHOLDER ACTION**

(a) Subject to Condition 12 (Enforcement of Security) above and paragraphs (b) and (c) below, no
Noteholder or Couponholder shall be entitled to take any proceedings or other action directly against
the Issuer or to enforce the Transaction Security, including:

(i) directing the Trustee to give a Request Instruction or Enforcement Instruction;

(ii) taking or joining any person in taking steps against the Issuer or to enforce the Transaction
Security for the purpose of obtaining payment of any amount due from the Issuer to it; and

(iii) initiating or joining any person in initiating any Insolvency Proceedings in relation to the
Issuer or the appointment of an Insolvency Official in relation to the Issuer or in relation to
the whole or any part of the undertakings or assets of the Issuer.

(b) If the Trustee having become bound to give a Note Acceleration Notice to the Issuer fails to do so
within 60 days or is unable to do so and that failure or inability is continuing, the holders of not less
than 25 per cent. in aggregate of the principal amount of the Notes outstanding may, as applicable,
sign and give a Note Acceleration Notice to the Issuer in accordance with Condition 11 (Events of
_Default)._

(c) If the Trustee having become bound to give a Request Instruction to the Security Agent fails to do so
within 60 days or is unable to do so and that failure or inability is continuing, the holders of not less
than 25 per cent. in aggregate of the principal amount of the Notes outstanding may, as applicable,
give a Request Instruction in writing directly to the Security Agent.

(d) If the Trustee having become bound to inform the Issuer and the Security Agent of the aggregate
principal amount of Notes represented by the holders of Notes voting in favour of an Enforcement

LON54468925 99


-----

Instruction fails to do so within 60 days or is unable to do so and that failure or inability is continuing,
the Noteholders may provide their Noteholder Direction in writing in relation to the taking of
enforcement action in relation to the Transaction Security pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement
directly to the Security Agent.

**14.** **SUBSTITUTION**

The Trustee may, without the consent of the Noteholders or Couponholders, agree with the Issuer to the
substitution in place of the Issuer (or of any previous substitute under this Condition) as the principal debtor
under the Notes, the Coupons and the Trust Deed, of any Subsidiary of the Issuer, any successor in business of
the Issuer or any Holding Company of the Issuer, as more fully set forth in the Trust Deed, subject to (i) the
Trustee being satisfied that the interests of the Noteholders will not be materially prejudiced by the
substitution, and (ii) certain other conditions set out in the Trust Deed being complied with. As more fully set
forth in the Trust Deed (and subject to the conditions and qualifications therein), the Trustee may, without the
consent of the Noteholders, also agree with the Issuer as to the substitution of another corporation in place of
the Issuer as principal debtor under the Notes, the Coupons and the Trust Deed.

**15.** **REPLACEMENT OF NOTES AND COUPONS**

If any Note or Coupon is lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed it may be replaced at the specified office
of the Principal Paying Agent in London, subject to all applicable laws and stock exchange requirements, upon
payment by the claimant of the expenses incurred in connection with such replacement and on such terms as to
evidence, security, indemnity and otherwise as the Issuer may require (provided that the requirement is
reasonable in the light of prevailing market practice). Mutilated or defaced Notes or Coupons must be
surrendered before replacements will be issued.

**16.** **MEETINGS OF NOTEHOLDERS, MODIFICATION, WAIVER AND AUTHORISATION**

(a) The Trust Deed contains provisions for convening meetings of the Noteholders to consider any matter
affecting their interests, including the modification by Extraordinary Resolution of any of these
Conditions or any of the provisions of the Trust Deed, the Notes, the Coupons, the Agency
Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Transaction Security Documents. Such a meeting may
be convened by the Issuer or the Trustee and shall be convened by the Issuer at the request of
Noteholders holding not less than ten per cent. in principal amount of the Notes for the time being
remaining outstanding. The quorum at any meeting for passing an Extraordinary Resolution will be
one or more persons present holding or representing a clear majority in principal amount of the Notes
for the time being outstanding, or at any adjourned meeting one or more persons present whatever the
principal amount of the Notes held or represented by him or them, except that at any meeting, the
business of which includes the modification of certain of these Conditions and certain of the
provisions of the Trust Deed, the necessary quorum for passing an Extraordinary Resolution will be
one or more persons present holding or representing not less than two-thirds, or at any adjourned such
meeting not less than one-third, of the principal amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding.
The matters (the “Basic Terms Modifications”) that require such a quorum are:

(i) changing any date fixed for payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest in respect of
the Notes, reducing or cancelling the amount of principal, premium (if any) or interest
payable on any date in respect of the Notes, altering the method of calculating the amount of
any payment in respect of the Notes on redemption, maturity or following the occurrence of
a Change of Control or altering the method of calculating the date for any such payment;

(ii) alteration of the currency in which payments under the Notes and Coupons are to be made;

(iii) impairing the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or after the stated
maturity thereof (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the redemption date);

(iv) except as provided under Condition 4.6 (Negative Pledge), Condition 5 (The Intercreditor
_Agreement) or paragraph (c) of this Condition, make any change to any Intercreditor_
Agreement (or any amended Intercreditor Agreement or replacement thereof) or any
provisions of the Trust Deed affecting the ranking of the Notes and the ranking of the
payment obligations under the Notes, in each case in a manner that adversely affects the
rights of the Noteholders or directly or indirectly releases the Transaction Security under the
Transaction Security Documents, except as permitted by these Conditions, the Trust Deed,
any Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction Security Documents;

(v) alteration of the quorum or majority required to pass an Extraordinary Resolution; and

LON54468925 100


-----

(vi) alteration of (A) the definition of Basic Terms Modifications or (B) the quorum
requirements for any meeting convened to vote on any Basic Terms Modifications.

An Extraordinary Resolution passed at any meeting of the Noteholders will be binding on all Noteholders,
whether or not they are present at the meeting, and on all Couponholders.

The Trust Deed provides that (i) a resolution passed at a meeting duly convened and held in accordance with
the Trust Deed by a majority consisting of not less than three quarters of the votes cast on such a resolution,
(ii) a resolution in writing signed by or on behalf of the holders of not less than three-quarters in principal
amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding or (iii) consents given by way of electronic consents
through the relevant clearing system(s) (in a form satisfactory to the Trustee) by or on behalf of the holder(s)
of not less than three quarters in principal amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding, shall, in each
case, be effective as an Extraordinary Resolution. Such a resolution in writing may be contained in one
document or several documents in the same form, each signed by or on behalf of one or more Noteholders.

(b) The Trustee may (in the case of paragraphs (i)(A), (i)(B) and (ii)) and shall (in the case of
paragraph (i)(C)) agree, without the consent of the Noteholders or Couponholders:

(i)

(A) to any modification of, or to the waiver or authorisation of any breach or proposed
breach of, any of these Conditions or any of the provisions of the Trust Deed, the
Notes, the Coupons, the Agency Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or the
Transaction Security Documents (save to the extent such modification, waiver or
authorisation relates to any Basic Terms Modification) which is not, in the opinion
of the Trustee, materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders; or

(B) to any modification which is of a formal, minor or technical nature or to correct a
manifest error or an error which, in the opinion of the Trustee, is proven; or

(C) to any modification which is requested by the Issuer in order to allow the Issuer to
comply with any requirements which apply to it under EMIR subject to the Trustee
receiving a certificate from the Issuer certifying to the Trustee that the amendments
are to be made solely for the purpose of enabling the Issuer to satisfy its
requirements under EMIR, unless the Trustee is of the opinion that such
modification would have the effect of exposing the Trustee to any liability against
which it has not been indemnified and/or secured and/or pre-funded to its
satisfaction or the effect of increasing the obligations or duties or decreasing the
protections of the Trustee in any of these Conditions or any of the provisions of the
Trust Deed, the Notes, the Coupons, the Agency Agreement, the Intercreditor
Agreement or the Transaction Security Documents; or

(ii) to determine that any Event of Default or Default shall not be treated as such, subject to
instructions to the contrary from the Noteholders in the form of an Extraordinary Resolution
(as further provided in the Trust Deed).

(c) The Trust Deed also provides that at the request and expense of the Issuer and without the consent of
the Noteholders:

(i) at the time of, or prior to, the incurrence of any Financial Indebtedness that is permitted to
share the Transaction Security, the Issuer, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into
an additional intercreditor agreement on terms substantially similar to the Intercreditor
Agreement or an amendment to the Intercreditor Agreement to (1) cure any ambiguity,
omission, defect or inconsistency of the Intercreditor Agreement, (2) increase the amount or
types of Financial Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be incurred by the
Issuer that is subject to any such agreement (provided that such Financial Indebtedness is
incurred in compliance with these Conditions and the terms of the Trust Deed), (3) further
secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (4) make provision for equal and rateable
pledges of the Transaction Security to secure Additional Notes or to implement any Security
permitted under these Conditions or the Intercreditor Agreement or (5) make any other
change to any such agreement that is not in the opinion of the Trustee materially prejudicial
to the interests of the Noteholders; _provided that any amendment to the Intercreditor_
Agreement will not impose or extend any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security
Agent or adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities, protections or immunities of the
Trustee and/or the Security Agent under these Conditions, the Trust Deed, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Security Document; and

LON54468925 101


-----

(ii) the Trustee and the Security Agent may from time to time enter into one or more
amendments to the Transaction Security Documents to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission,
defect or inconsistency therein or reflect changes of a minor, technical or administrative
nature, (2) provide for any Security permitted under these Conditions, (3) add to the
Transaction Security or (4) make any other change thereto that is not, in the opinion of the
Trustee, materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders.

(d) Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, in connection with the exercise by it of any of its trusts,
powers or discretions (including, without limitation, any modification, waiver, authorisation,
determination or substitution), the Trustee shall have regard to the general interests of the Noteholders
as a class but shall not have regard to any interests arising from circumstances particular to individual
Noteholders or Couponholders (whatever their number) and, in particular but without limitation, shall
not have regard to the consequences of the exercise of its trusts, powers or discretions for individual
Noteholders or Couponholders (whatever their number) resulting from their being for any purpose
domiciled or resident in, or otherwise connected with, or subject to the jurisdiction of, any particular
territory and the Trustee shall not be entitled to require, nor shall any Noteholder or Couponholder be
entitled to claim, from the Issuer or any other person any indemnification or payment in respect of any
tax consequence of any such exercise upon individual Noteholders or Couponholders except to the
extent already provided for in Condition 10 (Taxation) and/or any undertaking given in addition to, or
in substitution for, Condition 10 (Taxation) pursuant to the Trust Deed.

(e) Any modification, waiver, authorisation, determination or substitution shall be binding on the
Noteholders and the Couponholders, and any modification, unless the Trustee agrees otherwise, or
substitution shall be notified by the Issuer to the Noteholders as soon as practicable thereafter in
accordance with Condition 20 (Notices).

**17.** **THE TRUSTEE**

The Trust Deed contains provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee and for its relief from responsibility,
including provisions relieving it from taking action unless indemnified and/or secured and/or pre-funded to its
satisfaction.

Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee may at any time, at its discretion and without
notice, take such proceedings against the Issuer or the Parent as it may think fit to enforce the provisions of
these Conditions, the Trust Deed, the Notes, the Coupons, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Transaction
Security Documents (as applicable), but it shall not be bound to take any such proceedings or any other action
in relation to the Trust Deed, the Notes, the Coupons, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Transaction Security
Documents unless (i) it shall have been so directed by an Extraordinary Resolution of the Noteholders or so
requested in writing by the holders of at least 25 per cent. in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding
and shall not have received any contrary direction by an Extraordinary Resolution of the Noteholders or in
writing by the holders of at least 50 per cent. in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, and (ii) it shall
have been indemnified and/or secured and/or pre-funded to its satisfaction.

The Trustee may rely on any certificate or report of the Issuer’s auditors or any other person called for by or
provided to the Trustee (whether or not addressed to the Trustee) in accordance with or for the purposes of the
Trust Deed, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Transaction Security Documents notwithstanding that such
certificate or report and/or any engagement letter or other document entered into by the Trustee in connection
therewith contains a monetary or other limit on the liability of the auditors of the Issuer or such other person in
respect thereof.

The Trust Deed also contains provisions pursuant to which the Trustee is entitled, inter alia, (a) to enter into
business transactions with the Parent and/or the Parent’s other Subsidiaries (including the Issuer) and to act as
trustee for the holders of any other securities issued or guaranteed by, or relating to, the Parent and/or any of
the Parent’s other Subsidiaries, (b) to exercise and enforce its rights, comply with its obligations and perform
its duties under or in relation to any such transactions or, as the case may be, any such trusteeship without
regard to the interests of, or consequences for, the Noteholders or Couponholders, and (c) to retain and not be
liable to account for any profit made or any other amount or benefit received thereby or in connection
therewith.

The Trustee shall not be required to review or check any accounts or other information provided to it by the
Issuer pursuant to the Trust Deed and shall have no liability to any person as a result of any failure to do so.

**18.** **NO PERSONAL LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND SHAREHOLDERS**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator, member or shareholder of the Issuer will have any liability for
any obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Coupons or the Trust Deed or for any claim based on, in

LON54468925 102


-----

respect of, or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Noteholder by accepting a Note and each
Couponholder by accepting a coupon waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of
the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver and release may not be effective to waive liabilities
under the US federal securities laws.

**19.** **FURTHER ISSUES**

The Issuer is at liberty from time to time without the consent of the Noteholders (but subject to compliance
with the provisions of Condition 4.1 (Financial Covenants) to create and issue further bonds or notes ranking
_pari passu in all respects (or in all respects save for the first payment of interest thereon) and so that the same_
shall be consolidated and form a single series with the outstanding bonds or notes of any series (including the
Notes) constituted by the Trust Deed or any deed supplemental thereto (the “Additional Notes”). Any
Additional Notes shall be constituted by a deed supplemental to the Trust Deed.

**20.** **NOTICES**

Notices to Noteholders will be valid if published in a leading daily newspaper having general circulation in
London (which is expected to be the _Financial Times). The Issuer shall also ensure that all notices are duly_
published in a manner which complies with the rules and regulations of the London Stock Exchange and any
other listing authority, stock exchange and/or quotation system on which the Notes are for the time being
listed. Any such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published
more than once or on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made. Couponholders will be
deemed for all purposes to have notice of the contents of any notice given to the Noteholders in accordance
with this Condition.

**PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE NOTES WHILE REPRESENTED BY THE GLOBAL NOTES**

The following is an overview of the provisions to be contained in the Trust Deed to constitute the Notes and in the
Global Notes which will apply to, and in some cases modify, the Terms and Conditions of the Notes while the Notes are
represented by the Global Notes.

**1.** **Exchange**

The Permanent Global Note will be exchangeable in whole but not in part (free of charge to the holder) for definitive
Notes only:

(a) upon the happening of any of the events defined in the Terms and Conditions of the Notes (“Conditions”) as
“Events of Default”;

(b) if either Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg is closed for business for a continuous period of 14 days (other
than by reason of holiday, statutory or otherwise) or announces an intention permanently to cease business or
does in fact do so and no alternative clearing system satisfactory to the Trustee is available; or

(c) if the Issuer would suffer a disadvantage as a result of a change in laws or regulations (taxation or otherwise)
or as a result of a change in the practice of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg which would not be
suffered were the Notes in definitive form and a certificate to such effect signed by two Directors of the Issuer
is given to the Trustee.

Thereupon (in the case of (a) and (b) above) the holder of the Permanent Global Note (acting on the instructions of one
or more of the Accountholders (as defined below)) or the Trustee may give notice to the Issuer and (in the case of (c)
above) the Issuer may give notice to the Trustee and the Noteholders, of its intention to exchange the Permanent Global
Note for definitive Notes on or after the Exchange Date (as defined below).

On or after the Exchange Date the holder of the Permanent Global Note may or, in the case of (c) above, shall surrender
the Permanent Global Note to or to the order of the Principal Paying Agent. In exchange for the Permanent Global Note
the Issuer will deliver, or procure the delivery of, an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Notes (having
attached to them all Coupons in respect of interest which has not already been paid on the Permanent Global Note),
security printed in accordance with any applicable legal and stock exchange requirements and in or substantially in the
form set out in the Trust Deed. On exchange of the Permanent Global Note, the Issuer will procure that it is cancelled
and, if the holder so requests, returned to the holder together with any relevant definitive Notes.

For these purposes, “Exchange Date” means a day specified in the notice requiring exchange falling not less than 60
days after that on which such notice is given and being a day on which banks are open for general business in the place
in which the specified office of the Principal Paying Agent is located and, except in the case of exchange pursuant to (b)
above, in the place in which the relevant clearing system is located.

**2.** **Payments**

No payment will be made on the Temporary Global Note unless exchange for an interest in the Permanent Global Note
is improperly withheld or refused. Payments of principal, premium and interest in respect of Notes represented by a
Global Note will, subject as set out below, be made to the bearer of such Global Note against presentation for
endorsement and, if no further payment falls to be made in respect of the Notes, against surrender of such Global Note
to the order of the Principal Paying Agent or such other Paying Agent as shall have been notified to the Noteholders for
such purposes. A record of each payment made will be endorsed on the appropriate part of the schedule to the relevant
Global Note by or on behalf of the Principal Paying Agent, which endorsement shall be prima facie evidence that such
payment has been made in respect of the Notes. Payments of interest on the Temporary Global Note (if permitted by the
first sentence of this paragraph) will be made only upon certification as to non-U.S. beneficial ownership unless such
certification has already been made.

**3.** **Notices**

For so long as all of the Notes are represented by one or both of the Global Notes and such Global Note(s) is/are held on
behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, notices to Noteholders (including any notices to be delivered to
the Noteholders pursuant to Condition 12 (Enforcement of Security)) may be given by delivery of the relevant notice to
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg (as the case may be) for communication to the relative Accountholders
rather than by publication as required by Condition 20 (Notices). Any such notice shall be deemed to have been given to
the Noteholders on the second day after the day on which such notice is delivered to Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
Luxembourg (as the case may be) as aforesaid.

LON54468925 114


-----

Whilst any of the Notes held by a Noteholder are represented by a Global Note, notices to be given by such Noteholder
(including any Noteholder Direction pursuant to Condition 12 (Enforcement of Security)) may be given by such
Noteholder (where applicable) through Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg and otherwise in such manner as the
Principal Paying Agent and Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg may approve for this purpose.

**4.** **Accountholders**

For so long as all of the Notes are represented by one or both of the Global Notes and such Global Note(s) is/are held on
behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, each person (other than Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg)
who is for the time being shown in the records of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg as the holder of a particular
principal amount of such Notes (each an “Accountholder”) (in which regard any certificate or other document issued
by Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg as to the principal amount of such Notes standing to the account of any
person shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding for all purposes) shall be treated as the holder
of such principal amount of such Notes for all purposes (including but not limited to, for the purposes of any quorum
requirements of, or the right to demand a poll at, meetings of the Noteholders and giving notice to the Issuer or, as the
case may be, the Trustee pursuant to Condition 11 (Events of Default), Condition 12 (Enforcement of Security) and
Condition 7.3 (Purchase of Notes Upon a Change of Control)) other than with respect to the payment of principal,
premium and interest on such principal amount of such Notes, the right to which shall be vested, as against the Issuer
and the Trustee, solely in the bearer of the relevant Global Note in accordance with and subject to its terms and the
terms of the Trust Deed. Each Accountholder must look solely to Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case
may be, for its share of each payment made to the bearer of the relevant Global Note.

**5.** **Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer in respect of principal, premium and interest on the Notes represented by a Global Note will
be prescribed after ten years from the appropriate payment date (in the case of principal and premium) and five years
from the relevant Interest Payment Date (in the case of interest).

**6.** **Cancellation**

Cancellation of any Note represented by a Global Note and required by the Conditions of the Notes to be cancelled
following its redemption or purchase will be effected by endorsement by or on behalf of the Principal Paying Agent of
the reduction in the principal amount of the relevant Global Note on the relevant part of the schedule thereto.

**7.** **Put Option**

For so long as all of the Notes are represented by one or both of the Global Notes and such Global Note(s) is/are held on
behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, the option of the Noteholders provided for in Condition 7.3
(Purchase of Notes Upon a Change of Control) may be exercised by an Accountholder giving notice to the Principal
Paying Agent in accordance with the standard procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg (which may
include notice being given on his instructions by Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg or any common depositary for
them to the Principal Paying Agent by electronic means) of the principal amount of the Notes in respect of which such
option is exercised and at the same time presenting or procuring the presentation of the relevant Global Note to the
Principal Paying Agent for notation accordingly within the time limits set forth in that Condition.

**8.** **Redemption at the Option of the Issuer**

For so long as all of the Notes are represented by one or both of the Global Notes and such Global Note(s) is/are held on
behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, in the event that the Issuer exercises its call option pursuant to
Condition 7.2(a) (Optional Redemption) in respect of less than the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding
at such time, the Notes shall be redeemed on a pro rata basis or, if redemption on a pro rata basis is not permitted by
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg at such time, the standard procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
Luxembourg shall operate to determine which interests in the Global Note(s) are to be subject to such option.

**9.** **Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg**

References in the Global Notes and this summary to Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg shall be deemed to
include references to any other clearing system approved by the Trustee.

**10.** **Payment Business Day**

_Business Day: Notwithstanding the definition of “Business Day” in Condition 21 (Definitions), while any Bonds are_
represented by a Global Bond or a Global Bond Certificate and such Global Bond or Global Bond Certificate is held on
behalf of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg and/or any other relevant Clearing System, “Business Day” and
“business day” shall mean any day which is a day on which dealings in foreign currencies may be carried on in
London.

**TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**UNITED KINGDOM TAXATION**

**The following is a general description of certain UK taxation considerations in relation to the Notes based on**
**current law and published practice in the UK as at the date of this Prospectus. It does not purport to be a**
**complete analysis of all tax considerations relating to the Notes. The comments relate only to the position of**
**persons who are absolute beneficial owners of the Notes and some aspects do not apply to certain classes of**
**taxpayer (such as dealers, trustees and Noteholders who are connected or associated with the Issuer for relevant**
**tax purposes). The summary set out below is a general guide and should be treated with appropriate caution.**
**Prospective purchasers who are in any doubt as to their tax position or who may be subject to tax in a**
**jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom should consult their professional advisors. In particular, holders of**
**the Notes should be aware that they may be liable to taxation under the laws of other jurisdictions in relation to**
**payments in respect of the Notes even if such payments may be made without withholding or deduction for or on**
**account of taxation under the laws of the UK. The below description of the UK tax position assumes that there**
**will be no substitution of the Issuer pursuant to Condition 14 (Substitution) of the Notes and does not consider**
**the tax consequences of any such substitution.**

**UK Withholding Tax on UK source interest**

The Notes issued by the Issuer will constitute “quoted Eurobonds” within the meaning of section 987 of the Income Tax
Act 2007 provided they carry a right to interest and they are and continue to be listed on a “recognised stock exchange”
within the meaning of section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The London Stock Exchange has been designated as a
recognised stock exchange for these purposes. The Notes will be treated as listed on the London Stock Exchange if they
are admitted to the Official List of the Financial Conduct Authority and are admitted to trading on the London Stock
Exchange. Accordingly, the Notes will constitute “quoted Eurobonds” and payments of interest on the Notes may be
made without withholding on account of UK income tax provided the Notes remain so listed at the time of payment.

Interest on the Notes may also be paid without withholding or deduction for or on account of UK income tax where
interest on the Notes is paid by a company and, at the time the payment is made, the Issuer (and any person by or
through whom interest on the Notes is paid) reasonably believes that the beneficial owner is within the charge to UK
corporation tax as regards the payment of interest or the payment is made to one of the classes of exempt bodies or
persons set out in sections 935 to 937 of the Income Tax Act 2007, provided that HM Revenue & Customs has not
given a direction that the interest should be paid under deduction of tax.

In cases falling outside the exemptions described above, an amount must generally be withheld from payments of
interest on the Notes that has a United Kingdom source on account of UK income tax at the basic rate (currently 20 per
cent.) subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty.

**Further United Kingdom Income Tax issues**

Interest on the Notes that constitutes UK source income for tax purposes may, as such, be subject to income tax by
direct assessment even where paid without withholding. However, interest with a UK source received without deduction
or withholding on account of UK tax will generally not be chargeable to UK tax in the hands of a Noteholder who is not
resident for tax purposes in the UK unless that Noteholder carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the UK through a
UK branch or agency or, for holders who are companies, through a UK permanent establishment, in connection with
which the interest is received or to which the Notes are attributable. There are exemptions for interest received by
certain categories of agent (such as some brokers and investment managers).

The attention of Noteholders is drawn to Condition 10 (Taxation) of the Notes. The provisions relating to additional
payments referred to in Condition 10 (Taxation) of the Notes would not apply if HM Revenue & Customs sought to
assess the person entitled to the relevant interest or (where applicable) profit on any Note directly to UK income tax.
However, exemption from or reduction of such UK tax liability might be available under an applicable double taxation
treaty.

The references to “interest” above mean “interest” as understood in UK tax law, and in particular any premium element
of the redemption amount of any Notes redeemable at a premium may constitute a payment of interest subject to the
withholding tax provisions discussed above. In certain cases, the same could be true for amounts of discount where
Notes are issued at a discount. The statements above do not take any account of any different definitions of “interest” or
“principal” which may prevail under any other law or which may be created by the terms and conditions of the Notes or
any related documentation.

**United Kingdom Corporation Tax Payers**

In general Noteholders which are within the charge to UK corporation tax (other than, for example, investment trusts,
venture capital trusts, authorised unit trusts and open ended investment companies) will be treated for tax purposes as

LON54468925 116


-----

realising profits, gains or losses (including exchange gains and losses) in respect of the Notes on a basis which is
broadly in accordance with their statutory accounting treatment so long as the accounting treatment is in accordance
with generally accepted accounting practice as that term is defined for tax purposes. Such profits, gains and losses (or
where the Noteholder’s functional currency is not sterling, then the sterling equivalent of such profits, gains and losses
as computed in the Noteholder’s functional currency) will be taken into account in computing taxable income for
corporation tax purposes.

**Other UK Tax Payers**

**_Taxation of Chargeable Gains_**

The Notes may constitute “qualifying corporate bonds” within the meaning of section 117 of the Taxation of
Chargeable Gains Act 1992, provided that interest payable in respect of the Notes represents a reasonable commercial
return on the Issue Price of the Notes. If the Notes are “qualifying corporate bonds”, a disposal by a Noteholder will not
give rise to a chargeable gain or an allowable loss for the purposes of the UK taxation of chargeable gains. If the Notes
are not “qualifying corporate bonds” a disposal may give rise to a chargeable gain or an allowable loss, and prospective
Noteholders are advised to seek their own professional advice.

If the Notes are deeply discounted securities within Chapter 8 of Part 4 of the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income)
Act 2005, they will constitute “qualifying corporate bonds” regardless of whether interest payable in respect of the
Notes represents a reasonable commercial return on the Issue Price of the Notes.

**_Taxation of Discount_**

Notwithstanding the chargeable gains treatment, if the Notes constitute "deeply discounted securities" within Chapter 8
of Part 4 of the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005, any gain realised on redemption or transfer of the
Notes by a Noteholder who is within the charge to United Kingdom income tax in respect of the Notes will generally be
taxable as income but such Noteholder will not be able to claim relief from income tax in respect of costs incurred on
the acquisition, transfer or redemption, or losses incurred on the transfer or redemption, of the Notes.

**_Accrued Income Scheme_**

The provisions of the accrued income scheme (the “Scheme”) may apply to certain Noteholders who are not subject to
corporation tax, in relation to a transfer of the Notes.

On a transfer of securities with accrued interest the Scheme usually applies to deem the transferor to receive an amount
of income equal to the accrued interest and to treat the deemed or actual interest subsequently received by the transferee
as reduced by a corresponding amount.

Generally, persons who are not resident in the UK and who do not carry on a trade in the UK through a branch or
agency to which the Notes are attributable will not be subject to the provisions of these rules.

The Scheme will not apply in relation to Notes which constitute deeply discounted securities as defined in Chapter 8 of
Part 4 of the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005.

**Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax**

It is expected that no stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax will be payable on issue of the Notes or on a transfer of
Notes.

**THE PROPOSED FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS TAX** **(“FTT”)**

On 14 February 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the **_Original Proposal) for a Directive for a_**
common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia
(each, other than Estonia, a participating Member State). However, Estonia has since stated that it will not participate.

The Original Proposal had a very broad scope: under the Original Proposal the FTT could apply in certain
circumstances to persons both within and outside of the participating Member States, and could apply to various types
of financial instrument.

In June 2019, the Economic and Financial Affairs Council of the European Union (ECOFIN) again discussed the
possibility of moving forward with the FTT. The most recent proposal (the **_New Proposal) is for the FTT to apply_**
(more narrowly than was envisioned by the Original Proposal) to acquisitions of shares of listed companies which are
headquartered in participating Member States. It was suggested that agreement on an FTT might be reached in Autumn
2019, though no agreement has yet been published.

LON54468925 117


-----

The FTT proposal and the scope of any such tax remains subject to negotiation between the participating Member
States and additional EU Member States may also decide to participate. While under the New Proposal the FTT should
not apply to dealings in the Notes, the New Proposal may be altered prior to any implementation.

Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

**SUBSCRIPTION AND SALE**

Barclays Bank PLC, BNP Paribas, ING Bank N.V., London Branch (together, the “Active Managers”), Banca IMI
S.p.A., ICBC Standard Bank Plc, Merrill Lynch International and National Australia Bank Limited ABN 12 004 044
937 (together, the “Passive Bookrunners” and together with the Active Managers, the “Managers”) have, pursuant to
a subscription agreement (the “Subscription Agreement”) dated 15 November 2019, jointly and severally agreed to
subscribe the Notes at the issue price of 100 per cent. of the principal amount of Notes, less a combined management
and underwriting commission and selling concession. The Issuer will also reimburse the Managers in respect of certain
of their expenses, and has agreed to indemnify the Managers against certain liabilities, incurred in connection with the
issue of the Notes. The Subscription Agreement may be terminated in certain circumstances prior to payment of the
Issuer. The Managers and certain of their affiliates from time to time have performed, and in the future will perform,
banking, investment banking, advisory, consulting and other financial services for the Group, for which they have
received and may in the future receive customary advisory and transaction fees and expense reimbursement.

Some of the Managers and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking and
other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with the Issuer or other members of the Group. Such
Managers have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions. Each of
the Passive Bookrunners have not actively been involved in placing the Notes.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Managers and their affiliates may make or hold a
broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial
instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and
securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments issued by the Issuer or other members of the Group.
Certain of the Managers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with the Issuer or another member of the
Group routinely hedge their credit exposure to Issuer or such member of the Group consistent with their customary risk
management policies. Typically, such Managers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into
transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities
issued by the Issuer or another member of the Group, including potentially the Notes. Any such short positions could
adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes. The Managers and their affiliates may also make investment
recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial
instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and
instruments.

**United States**

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the
United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except in accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to
any other exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

The Notes are subject to U.S. tax law requirements and may not be offered, sold or delivered within the United States or
its possessions or to a United States person, except in certain transactions permitted by U.S. tax regulations. Terms used
in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and regulations
thereunder.

Each Manager has agreed that, except as permitted by the Subscription Agreement, it will not offer, sell or deliver the
Notes (a) as part of their distribution at any time or (b) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of
the offering and the Closing Date within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons and that it
will have sent to each dealer to which it sells any Notes during the distribution compliance period a confirmation or
other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes within the United States or to, or for the
account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S
under the Securities Act.

In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the offering, an offer or sale of Notes within the United States by
any dealer that is not participating in the offering may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

**United Kingdom**

Each Manager has represented and agreed that:

(A) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of
the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which Section
21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer; and

(B) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it
in relation to any Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

LON54468925 119


-----

**Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors**

Each of the Managers has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not
offer, sell or otherwise make available any Notes to any retail investor in the European Economic Area. For the
purposes of this provision, the expression "retail investor" means a person who is one (or more) of the following:

(A) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or

(B) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Mediation Directive, where that customer would not qualify as
a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II.

**General**

No action has been taken by the Issuer or any of the Managers that would, or is intended to, permit a public offer of the
Notes in any country or jurisdiction where any such action for that purpose is required. Accordingly, each Manager has
undertaken that it will not, directly or indirectly, offer or sell any Notes or distribute or publish any offering circular,
prospectus, form of application, advertisement or other document or information in any country or jurisdiction except
under circumstances that will, to the best of its knowledge and belief, result in compliance with any applicable laws and
regulations and all offers and sales of Notes by it will be made on the same terms.

**Interest of persons involved in the offer of Notes**

Except as described in this “Subscription and Sale” section, so far as the Issuer is aware, no person involved in the offer
of the Notes has an interest material to the offer.
