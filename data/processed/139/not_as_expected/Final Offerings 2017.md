## Issue of £275 million 3.875 per cent. Senior Secured Notes due 2027

 Issue price: 100 per cent.

Heathrow Finance plc, a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (the “Issuer”), will issue £275
million aggregate principal amount of 3.875 per cent. Senior Secured Notes due 2027 (the “Notes”). Interest on the Notes will be
payable on 1 March and 1 September of each year, beginning on 1 March 2018. The Notes will mature on 1 March 2027. If the Issuer
undergoes a change of control, it may be required to offer to purchase the Notes from investors.

The Notes will be general secured senior obligations of the Issuer. The Notes will be secured by fixed and floating security interests
over substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and Heathrow (DSH) Limited, including first priority security interests in the share
capital of the Issuer and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Heathrow (SP) Limited, which is an intermediate holding company of the
Group (as defined below).

This Prospectus includes information on the terms of the Notes, including redemption and repurchase prices and covenants.

list of the UK Listing Authority (the “Official List”) and to the London Stock Exchange plc (the “London Stock Exchange”) for the
Notes to be admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange's Regulated Market (the “Market”). The Market is a regulated market
for the purposes of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2004/39/EC.

The Notes will initially be represented by a temporary global note (the “Temporary Global Note”), without interest coupons, which
will be deposited on or about 8 June 2017 (the “Closing Date”) with a common depositary for Euroclear Bank SA/NV
(“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, societe anonyme (“Clearstream, Luxembourg”). Interests in the Temporary Global Note
will be exchangeable for interests in a permanent global note (the “Permanent Global Note” and, together with the Temporary
Global Note, the “Global Notes”), without interest coupons, upon certification as to non-U.S. beneficial ownership. Interests in the
Permanent Global Note will be exchangeable for definitive Notes only in certain limited circumstances – see “Summary of Provisions
_relating to the Notes while represented by the Global Notes”._

**representations and agreements. See “Subscription and Sale” in this Prospectus. The Notes are subject to other restrictions**
**on transferability and resale as set forth in “Transfer Restrictions” in this Prospectus.**

**Neither the United States Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission in the United States nor**

Heathrow Airport is owned and operated by Heathrow, an indirect subsidiary of the Issuer (the Issuer, together with
Heathrow (SP) Limited, Heathrow (AH) Limited, Heathrow Funding Limited, Heathrow Airport Limited and Heathrow
Express Operating Company Limited (“Heathrow Express”) being the “Group”).

The Group companies are indirect subsidiaries of Heathrow Airport Holdings Limited (“Heathrow Airport Holdings”
and, together with its subsidiaries, the “Heathrow Airport Holdings Group”).

Heathrow Airport Holdings is indirectly owned by investment vehicles controlled or managed by Ferrovial S.A. (25.00
per cent.), Qatar Holding LLC (20.00 per cent.), Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (12.62 per cent.), the
Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (11.20 per cent.), Alinda Capital Partners (11.18 per cent.), China
Investment Corporation (10.00 per cent.) and Universities Superannuation Scheme (10.00 per cent.).

The Group generates two primary types of income:

(i) aeronautical income (£1,699 million or 60 per cent. of total income in 2016 (2015: £1,699 million)), which is
generated from fees charged to airlines for use of Heathrow Airport’s facilities for flight and passenger activities
and is subject to the CAA’s price caps; and

(ii) non-aeronautical income (£1,108 million or 40 per cent. of total income in 2016 (2015: £1,066 million)), which
is generated from retail and other sources, including concession fees from retail operators, direct income from
car parks, property rental income, rail income and other regulated charges for services supplied by Heathrow,
and is taken into account by the CAA in setting its price caps.

Heathrow Airport is subject to economic regulation by the Civil Aviation Authority (the “CAA”). The CAA sets caps
on the amount that Heathrow Airport can charge airlines for using its facilities.

The price caps are set for a five-year period (a “Quinquennium”), which may be extended. This price setting
mechanism provides significant cash flow predictability within each Quinquennium and provides substantial explicit
protection against costs resulting from new security regulations.

The price caps take into account Heathrow’s forecast revenues (both aeronautical and non-aeronautical) and costs as
well as allowing recovery of capital costs and a return on capital. The return on capital is based on Heathrow’s opening
Regulatory Asset Base (“RAB”) and its forecast capital expenditure for the Quinquennium. As for other regulated
utilities in the UK, the RAB acts as a unit of regulatory value and does not correspond to statutory asset values. The
RAB is adjusted on an ongoing basis principally for capital expenditure, RPI inflation, regulatory depreciation and
proceeds of disposals.

The regulated price-setting mechanism provides significant income predictability and cash flow visibility within each
regulatory period as well as protection against longer-term cost and revenue risks. The current Quinquennium for
Heathrow, Q6, was initially set to last from 1 April 2014 to 31 December 2018 in order to align Heathrow’s financial
and regulatory years. Heathrow’s current regulatory period was recently extended by the CAA by one year so that it
will end on 31 December 2019, rolling over the current price control of RPI-1.5 per cent. for the additional year.

**FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE**
The Group has continued to deliver a strong financial performance in recent years due to a combination of:

- Heathrow delivering record traffic and improvements in service standards and passenger experience;

- strong retail performance reflecting enhancements to the passenger experience such as refurbishment of
Terminals 3, 4 and 5 and major redevelopment of the luxury retail facilities in Terminals 4 and 5; and

- a continuing focus on operational improvement and cost control.

As a result, in 2016 the Group saw revenue and Adjusted EBITDA increase by 1.5 per cent and 4.8 per cent
respectively. The Group’s financial performance in 2016 reflected, in particular, record traffic levels and cost control.

This strong underlying performance has continued into 2017 with the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA for the first three
months of the year increasing by 4.1 per cent compared to the same period in 2016.

**Revenue**

The table below details the Group's revenue for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 as well as
for the three months ended 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016 (“3M 2016” and “3M 2017”).

**Total ........................................................................................** **655** **642** **2,807** **2,765**

**Aeronautical income**
Aeronautical income includes airport fees and other traffic charges paid by airlines to Heathrow. Aeronautical income is
subject to a maximum allowable yield per passenger determined by the CAA.

Aeronautical income remained flat at £1,699 million in 2016 versus 2015 and also remained flat at £389 million in 3M
2017 versus 3M 2016.

Aeronautical income generation in 2016 versus 2015 reflected growth due to increased passenger traffic and yield
concentration, due primarily to greater proportions of long haul, origin and destination and departing passengers than
assumed when setting tariffs for the year, offset by a combination of a lower maximum allowable yield due to the RPI1.5 per cent. tariff formula applying in the current regulatory period, the non-recurrence of significant K factor recovery
in 2015 and lower capital expenditure than originally forecast in the current regulatory settlement. Aeronautical income
generation in 3M 2017 versus 3M 2016 reflected growth due to increased passenger traffic offset by a combination of a
lower maximum allowable yield due to the RPI-1.5 per cent. tariff formula applying in the current regulatory period,
lower capital expenditure than originally forecast in the current regulatory settlement and lower yield concentration than
in 3M 2016.

**Retail income**
Heathrow Airport generates retail income primarily from retail concession fees and car parking income. Third parties
operate all bars, restaurants, specialist shops, duty-free and tax-free outlets and other paid merchant services at the
airport under concessions granted by Heathrow Airport. Heathrow Airport also generates retail income or fees from
other services such as advertising, car rental and bureaux de change.

Heathrow’s retail business has performed strongly in recent years with the key performance indicator for the business,
retail income per passenger, increasing by £0.51 (6.7 per cent.) from £7.58 in 2015 to £8.09 in 2016. The retail business
performed strongly in 2016 following the major redevelopment of luxury stores in Terminal 5 including new brands
which have strengthened Heathrow’s unrivalled airport shopping experience. Performance in duty and tax-free stores
has continued to improve following extensive store refurbishment in Terminals 4 and 5. Income from catering increased
during 2016 as a result of new and refurbished outlets and increases in passenger participation. Car parking also
performed well, with continued take-up of Heathrow’s expanded car parking product range and successful yield
management. Growth in retail income accelerated in the second half of the year, particularly in areas such as duty and
tax-free and airside specialist shops, driven by the depreciation of sterling following the EU referendum in late June
2016. Redevelopment of luxury stores in Terminal 4 was largely completed in 2016 and started contributing to overall
retail performance during that period.

Retail income per passenger increased further, by £0.52 (6.4 per cent.) from £8.10 in 3M 2016 to £8.62 in 3M 2017
reflecting benefit, particularly in duty and tax-free and airside specialist shops, from the depreciation of sterling in June
2016 and increased passenger traffic. The redevelopment of Terminal 4’s luxury retail offering, completed in late 2016,
also contributed to growth.

**Other income**
Heathrow generates other income from the provision of operational facilities and utilities to airlines and other
businesses operating at the airport. This income includes rental of systems such as check-in and baggage-handling

6


-----

facilities and charges for providing electricity, telecommunications and water services. Heathrow Airport also generates
rental income from property such as cargo storage, aircraft hangars, maintenance facilities and office premises and
income from the Heathrow Express rail service.

**Adjusted operating costs – ordinary excluding depreciation and amortisation**
In the year ended 31 December 2016, the Group's adjusted operating costs – ordinary excluding depreciation,
amortisation and exceptional items decreased by £35 million (3.1 per cent.) from £1,160 million in 2015 to £1,125
million in 2016 and by £2 million (0.7 per cent.) from £275 million in 3M 2016 to £273 million in 3M 2017.

In 2016, the reduction in adjusted operating costs primarily reflected lower employment, utilities and other costs.
Employment costs benefited from changes to the defined benefit pension scheme, take-up of voluntary severance
programmes, lower new starter pay levels, lower headcount, automation and other workforce efficiencies, partially
offset by higher costs for implementing organisational change. Lower utilities costs particularly reflected a renegotiated contract for the provision of electricity distribution infrastructure services due to a combination of recurrent
cost savings and a one-off credit of £14 million related to prior periods. A focus on energy demand management
continues to drive savings in electricity consumption. Other costs reflected savings across consultancy, marketing and
general expenditure.

The lower adjusted operating costs in 3M 2017 versus 3M 2016 related primarily to utilities and other costs. Lower
utilities costs reflect the recurring savings from a contract for the provision of electricity distribution infrastructure
services re-negotiated in 2016. A focus on energy demand management also continued to drive savings in electricity
consumption. Other costs decreased due to various efficiencies and also due to expansion related costs starting to be
capitalised rather than expensed, following the UK Government’s decision in late 2016 to support Heathrow expansion.

**Financing of the Group**

**_Overview_**
The Group maintains a diversified multi-product, multi-currency funding platform which currently incorporates bond
issuance in Sterling, Euros, U.S. dollars, Swiss francs, Canadian dollars and Norwegian krone together with various
other forms of term debt as well as revolving credit facilities. As at 31 March 2017, the Group had consolidated
nominal net debt of £13,097 million of which £12,147 million was within the Issuer’s subsidiaries and £950 million was
at the Issuer level.

As at 31 March 2017, debt within the Issuer’s subsidiaries comprised £10,407 million in Class A net debt (Class A
bonds are rated A- by S&P and Fitch) and an additional £1,740 million in Class B debt (Class B bonds are rated BBB
by S&P and Fitch) which ranks behind the Class A debt. As at 31 March 2017, the Issuer itself had £950 million in net
debt which is serviced from its subsidiaries’ cashflows but is structurally subordinated to the Class A and B debt within
its subsidiaries.

Please see “Debt, gearing and interest cover statistics” on page 35.

**_Financing at Heathrow Finance plc_**

The Issuer has a combination of loan and bond financing in place which comprises:

- loan facilities of £175 million with final maturities of up to 2025 (the “2014 Issuer Facility”), £200 million with
final maturities of up to 2026 (the “2016 Issuer Facility 1”) and £150 million with a final maturity of 2028 (the

-----

“2016 Issuer Facility 2” and, together with the 2014 Issuer Facility and the 2016 Issuer Facility 1, the “Issuer
**Facilities”). £75 million of the 2016 Issuer Facility 1 is expected to be drawn by June 2017;**

- £263 million notes due 2019 (the “2019 Notes”); and

- £250 million notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”).

The issuance of Notes described in this Prospectus will rank pari passu with the Issuer Facilities, the 2019 Notes and
the 2025 Notes, and will benefit from the same security package.

**_Financing at the Senior Borrower Group_**

The Senior Borrower Group’s finances its activities through a mix of senior (Class A) and junior (Class B) term debt
(including bonds) and revolving credit facilities in a variety of tenors, formats and currencies. It hedges a significant
proportion of its interest rate, inflation and currency exposures under an agreed hedging policy.

Bonds are issued by Heathrow Funding Limited under its bond issuance programme, which was established in 2008.

The Senior Borrower Group also has access to various other forms of term debt and revolving credit and liquidity
facilities which have significant undrawn balances.

The Senior Borrower Group uses proceeds of bond issuances, term debt and revolving loan drawings for its general
corporate purposes, including to fund operating and capital expenditure, to pay interest and principal on its bonds, term
debt and revolving loans and, subject to the terms of its financing agreements, to make distributions to enable the
servicing of other parts of the Heathrow Airport Holdings Group’s capital structure, including payments of interest and
principal related to the Issuer’s debt and to enable the payment of dividends to the Heathrow Airport Holdings Group’s
ultimate shareholders.

As at 31 March 2017, the Issuer’s subsidiaries had outstanding £11.1 billion in nominal debt under 33 separate bond

**_Liquidity_**
At 31 March 2017, the Group had £1,350 million in cash resources and undrawn loan facilities, including £845 million
available under revolving credit and working capital facilities and £330 million in cash, cash equivalents and authorised
investments. The Group also has £175 million in committed term debt to be drawn by June 2017.

The Group is cash positive with £1,654 million cash from continuing operating activities in 2016.

The Group expects to have sufficient liquidity to meet all its obligations in full until December 2018. The obligations
include forecast capital investment (including expected investment over the period related to potential expansion), debt
service costs, debt maturities and distributions. The liquidity forecast takes into account the undrawn loan facilities and
term debt as well as cash resources at 31 March 2017 referred to above together with expected operating cash flow over
the period. Under the Senior Borrower Group Indebtedness common terms agreement (the “CTA”), it is required that
projected cashflow from operations after deducting finance charges together with cash at hand and any undrawn
balances under committed facilities exceeds 12 months’ projected capital expenditure.

**Ring-fencing of the Group**

Heathrow Airport Holdings has put in place a ring-fenced long-term debt financing platform for the Group. This
financing platform has been designed to support senior, junior and holding company bond and other term debt,
revolving credit facilities and associated hedging.

The Noteholders will, like the Class A and Class B bondholders, benefit from a range of structural enhancements,
including the following:

- the Group is insulated from Heathrow Airport Holdings insolvency:

– creditors have full security over both the Issuer and its parent Heathrow (DSH) Limited including a
pledge of shares in both the Issuer and the Security Parent;

– subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, Noteholders have the power to appoint an administrative receiver
to Heathrow (DSH) Limited and so prevent insolvency of the Issuer;

- there are no legal, economic or cash flow dependencies between the Issuer and Heathrow Airport Holdings
Group companies higher up the corporate structure:

– the Issuer is required to act solely as a holding company of the Security Parent, and its parent, Heathrow
(DSH) Limited, is required to act solely as a holding company for the Issuer;

– the Issuer has no other assets and no recourse or liability to other parts of the Heathrow Airport Holdings
Group;

– restrictions are in place on transactions with the wider Heathrow Airport Holdings Group to avoid value
transfer;

- an operational and financial covenant package including:

– restrictions on the Issuer's ability to distribute cash outside the Group, including restrictions on
distributions where:

          - _pro forma RAR is greater than 82 per cent. for Class A and Class B debt at the Security Parent_
(compared with 85 per cent. under the CTA). This is designed to provide headroom within the
Class B debt trigger levels at the Security Parent and so provide a liquidity buffer at the Issuer;

          - _pro forma RAR is greater than either 90 per cent. until such time as the 2019 Notes either mature,_
are repaid or consent is obtained to amend the Group RAR restrictions, or 92.5 per cent. thereafter
for debt at the Issuer;

– Noteholders benefit indirectly from the covenants (e.g. hedging policy, restrictions on Heathrow’s
activities and sale of key assets) which bind the Senior Borrower Group under the CTA; and

– a covenant that prevents the Senior Borrower Group agreeing to any tighter restrictions on distributions
than are currently in the CTA, so protecting the distributions which the Issuer requires to service its
indebtedness, including the Notes.

9


-----

Whilst the 2025 Notes have a restriction on distributions and breach of covenant when pro forma Group RAR is greater
than 92.5 per cent., the 2019 Notes have a restriction when pro forma Group RAR is greater than 90 per cent. The
Group intends to move over the medium term to having a restriction on distributions and breach of covenant when pro
forma Group RAR is greater than 92.5 per cent. once the 2019 Notes either mature, are repaid or consent is obtained to
amend the Group RAR restriction of 90 per cent. This change is intended to provide the Group with additional medium
term flexibility to manage its capital structure more efficiently.

For more details on the financing arrangements described above, see “Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Terms
_and Conditions of the Notes” in this Prospectus._

**_Use of proceeds of the Notes_**

The issuance of the Notes together with the expected use of proceeds outlined below will result in the amount of gross
debt at the Issuer being 8.3 per cent. of Heathrow Airport’s expected RAB at the end of 2017.

The net proceeds of the issue of the Notes are expected be used to repay existing indebtedness of the Group and/or its
holding companies, in particular, when combined with new term loans of up to £100 million raised at ADI Finance 2
Limited (“ADIF2”), a holding company of the Group, to repay £310 million in existing term loans at ADIF2.

**Key Strengths**
Heathrow has a number of key strengths, deriving from both the commercial strength of the airport and its status as
regulated infrastructure:

- Pre-eminent market position: Heathrow Airport is Europe’s busiest airport and the world's seventh busiest airport
in terms of total passengers. It enjoys a unique market position in the UK, being the country's only hub airport
and handling approximately 74 per cent. (in terms of seats) of all the UK's scheduled long-haul air traffic
(Source: IATA Airport IS schedules for 2016). It services of a range of market segments, including business and
leisure travellers, origin and destination and transfer passengers, long- and short-haul routes, and a diversified
range of major airlines.

- Unique location advantage: Heathrow Airport enjoys a strong position in the South East of England, one of the
world's busiest air traffic markets and a market with growing demand for air travel and limited airport capacity.

- Regulatory underpinning: price regulation by the CAA provides significant income predictability and cash flow
visibility within each regulatory period as well as protection against longer term cost and revenue risks.

- Proven resilience: The Group has consistently demonstrated its ability to perform and deliver, regardless of
market trends, shocks and economic downturns.

- Income diversification: revenue generation from a variety of sources, including charges to airlines, concession
fees from retail operators, income from car parks, advertising revenue, the rental of airport premises, the
provision of facilities and services and the Heathrow Express rail service.

- Operational excellence: track record of operating close to its permitted capacity for a number of years, delivering
large scale construction projects on time and on budget and consistently improving customers’ satisfaction.

**HEATHROW’S STRATEGY**
The Group’s strategy is focused on developing Heathrow Airport’s position from one of the best airports in Europe to
one of the best airports in the world.

To support and develop Heathrow Airport’s role as a hub, the Group will continue enabling the success of the major
network airlines operating at Heathrow Airport by investing in further capacity, operational flexibility and resilience at
sustainable charges for airline customers.

For both origin and destination and transfer passengers, Heathrow Airport is working continuously to make every
journey better through improved service standards to ensure it remains passengers’ preferred airport. Improving the
passenger experience is supported by ongoing investment in modern airport facilities and operating processes.

The Group has four strategic priorities to help deliver its strategy:

   - **Mojo: making Heathrow a great place to work, helping its people fulfil their potential and working together to**
lead change across the airport.

   - **Transforming customer service: aiming to deliver the world’s best passenger experience through working**
with the Heathrow Airport community to transform the service it gives to passengers and airlines.

10


-----

   - **Beating the plan: aiming to beat the Q6 business plan and deliver a competitive return by growing revenue,**
reducing costs and delivering investments efficiently.

   - **Sustainable growth: working to operate and grow Heathrow Airport sustainably, now and in the future.**

**EXPANSION OF HEATHROW AIRPORT**
Heathrow Airport has been operating close to its permitted limit on annual flights for a number of years and is the
busiest airport in the world with two or fewer runways, based on its mode and hours of operation. As a result, for a
significant period of time, it has been considering ways to deliver sustainable growth, by expanding its runway capacity
in order to deliver even greater benefits in its role as the country’s only hub airport, whilst mitigating the effects of
expansion particularly on local communities.

The UK Government established the Airports Commission in 2012 to identify and recommend options to maintain the
UK’s position as Europe’s most important aviation hub. After nearly three years’ study, in July 2015 the Airports
Commission recommended the expansion of Heathrow Airport through the construction of a new runway immediately
to the north west of the existing airport, together with associated infrastructure such as new terminal capacity and
taxiway systems. In October 2016, the UK Government announced its decision to support the expansion of Heathrow
Airport. The proposed expansion of Heathrow Airport is expected to deliver up to an additional 260,000 flights per
annum at the airport, taking the total to up to 740,000 flights per annum, which could result in annual passenger
numbers increasing to 130 million over time, compared to 75.7 million in 2016.

A broad range of workstreams involving various stakeholders is now underway initially aimed at Heathrow obtaining
the necessary formal policy support from the UK Government and consents to enable Heathrow to proceed with the
required construction programme. In February 2017, the UK Government published its draft Airports National Policy
Statement (“NPS”) outlining its policy for Heathrow Airport’s expansion. The final version of the NPS was expected to
be submitted to a vote in the UK Parliament during the winter of 2017/2018. The general election announced in April
2017 could delay the expected timetable. Assuming the required vote in favour, the Secretary of State for Transport is
expected to then ‘designate’ the final NPS following which Heathrow will need to apply for a Development Consent
Order (“DCO”). Heathrow is already working actively to develop its DCO application including preparing for an initial
public consultation later in 2017 on its expansion plans.

In parallel with the NPS and DCO processes, significant activity is currently underway on other key aspects of
expansion. These include the preparation of an application for airspace change consent, starting engagement with key
statutory stakeholders and airline engagement. Airline engagement is particularly focused on affordability and the scope
to meet the common aspiration to maintain Heathrow Airport’s charges at the lowest possible level, which is also
consistent with the UK Government’s proposals when it announced support for Heathrow expansion in October 2016.
In addition, there have been a number of, and in the coming months there are expected to be further, regulatory
developments related to the expansion of Heathrow Airport. See ‘Business—Expansion of Heathrow Airport’ and
‘Airport Regulation – Airport Regulation Generally – Regulatory Framework’ and ‘Airport Regulation – Heathrow
Price Regulation – Q6 Extension and H7.

**RISK FACTORS**

**_The following sets out certain aspects of the Group's financing documentation and the activities of the Group about_**
**_which prospective holders of the Notes should be aware. The occurrence of any of the events described below could have_**
**_a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Issuer or the Group and_**
**_could lead to, among other things, non-payment of amounts under the Notes._**

_This section of the Prospectus describes all material risks that are known to the Group as at the date of this Prospectus._
_This section of the Prospectus is not intended to be exhaustive and prospective holders of the Notes should read the_
_detailed information set out elsewhere in this document, including the documents incorporated by reference, prior to_
_making any investment decision. Further, prospective holders of the Notes should seek their own legal, financial,_
_accounting, tax and other relevant advice as to the structure and viability of an investment in the Notes._

_In addition, whilst the various structural elements described in this document are intended to lessen some of the risks_
_discussed below for holders of the Notes, there can be no assurance that these measures will ensure that the holders of the_
_Notes receive payment of interest or repayment of principal from the Issuer in respect of such Notes on a timely basis or at_
_all._

**COMMERCIAL RISKS**
**_The Group’s aeronautical income could decline as a result of a reduction in flights, passengers or other factors outside_**
**_the Group’s control which adversely impact the operating resilience of the Group._**

The Group generates aeronautical income from airport fees and traffic charges. These charges are regulated and principally
levied on the basis of passenger numbers, maximum total aircraft weight, aircraft noise and emission characteristics and
the length of time for which an aircraft is parked at the airport. The charges are also linked to the rate of inflation, which is
liable to change. There are no specific operating contracts with the airlines operating at Heathrow Airport. There can
therefore be no assurance as to the level of the Group’s future aeronautical income from any one or more airline operators.
Decisions by, legal disputes with, financial difficulties at, or the failure of, a significant airline customer, or the withdrawal
of their landing rights, could lead to a reduction in flights and passenger numbers and/or failure or delay in recovering
airport fees or landing charges. The effect of decisions by or events at airlines that have a major presence at Heathrow
Airport (such as British Airways which in 2016 accounted for approximately 44 per cent. of Heathrow Airport’s
aeronautical income (2015: 45 per cent.)) could have a material adverse effect on the Group.

The number of passengers using Heathrow Airport may be affected by a number of other factors, including:

- shocks to the macroeconomic environment (including, any potential impact of the UK exiting the European Union,
changes in fuel prices and currency exchange rates, inflation, employment and spending) whether affecting the
global economy, the UK economy or the Greater London economy in which Heathrow Airport is based;

- an increase or decrease in competition from UK and non-UK airports;

- wars, riots or political action;

- industrial action (including of airlines) that affects Heathrow Airport;

- an increase in airfares;

- airline bankruptcies;

- decisions by airlines regarding the number, type and capacity of aircraft (including the mix of premium and
economy seats), as well as the routes on which particular aircraft are utilised;

- health scares, epidemics or pandemics across the globe;

- disruptions caused by natural disasters or events, for example, the closure of airspace due to a volcanic eruption in
Iceland in 2010;

- extreme weather at Heathrow Airport or other airports, such as the severe winter weather experienced in the
northern hemisphere in December 2010, which caused over 4,000 flights to be cancelled at Heathrow Airport and
caused significant impact to airline schedules globally;

- acts of terrorism or cybersecurity threats and attacks;

16


-----

changes in domestic or international regulation, for instance international trade liberalisation developments such as
Open Skies (as defined below);

- the quality of services and facilities, including the impact of construction projects; and

- the development of efficient and viable alternatives to air travel, including the improvement or expansion of
existing surface transport systems, the introduction of new transport links or technology and the increased use of
communications technology.

The Group, where possible, seeks to anticipate the effects of the events noted above in its operations and also maintains
contingency plans to minimise disruption and passenger inconvenience. For example, in relation to the risk of industrial
action by key Group staff, the Group has a range of formal national and local consultative bodies to discuss pay,
employment conditions and business issues with trade unions. The Group reached a pay agreement in 2016 that
established a pay structure until 2019. The Group also maintains contingency plans aiming to mitigate impacts of potential
strikes.

There can be no guarantee that the Group’s contingency plans would be effective in anticipating the effects of the factors
noted above. Any of these factors could negatively impact the Group’s reputation, affect Heathrow Airport’s day-to-day
operations and result in a decrease in the number of passengers using Heathrow Airport which could in turn have a
material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_A decrease in passenger numbers or other factors outside the Group’s control could reduce non-aeronautical income._**

The Group’s principal sources of non-aeronautical income include retail concession fees, car parking income, property
rental income, rail income and income from the provision of operational facilities and utilities.

Retail concession fees are driven by passenger numbers and propensity of passengers to spend in the shops at Heathrow
Airport. As noted above, there are a variety of factors which could adversely affect the number of passengers using
Heathrow Airport. Levels of retail income may also be affected by changes in the mix of long- and short-haul and transfer
and origin and destination passengers; economic factors, including exchange rates and changes in duty free regimes; retail
tenant failures; lower retail yields on concession re-negotiations; redevelopments or reconfigurations of retail facilities at
Heathrow Airport, which can lead to a temporary or permanent decline in retail concession fees; reduced competitiveness
of the airport retail offering; stricter hand luggage and other carry-on restrictions; and reduced shopping time as a result of
more rigorous and time consuming security procedures. Car parking income could be reduced as a result of increased
competition from other modes of transport to Heathrow Airport, such as buses and trains, as well as increased competition
from off-site car parks. Rail income could be reduced as a result of additional direct rail connections to Heathrow Airport
following the expected commencement of Crossrail services between Paddington and Heathrow Airport from May 2018,
and between central London and Heathrow Airport from December 2019. Other non-aeronautical income could be reduced
as a result of a decrease in demand from airport users, such as car rental operators and airlines leasing check-in counters or
other facilities. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_The Group could be subject to terrorism and/or increased security requirements._**

The UK Government currently assesses the international terrorism threat to mainland Britain as “critical”, the highest
threat level on the government’s risk assessment scale. Heathrow Airport operates within a stringent and complex security
regime as required by the Government, which has imposed additional security measures from time to time, for example
following the discovery of terrorist plots in August 2006 and December 2009. An incident in 2010 involving cargo aircraft
led to additional measures for the cargo industry only. The consequences of any future terrorist action or threat may
include cancellation or delay of flights, fewer airlines and passengers using Heathrow Airport, liability for damage or loss
and the costs of repairing damage.

The implementation of additional security measures at Heathrow Airport in the future could lead to additional limitations
on airport capacity or retail space, overcrowding, increases in operating costs and delays to passenger movement through
the airport, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_The successful implementation of the Group’s capital investment programme could be affected by unanticipated_**
**_construction and consents issues._**

The Group’s capital investment programme includes major construction projects at Heathrow Airport including the
potential expansion of Heathrow Airport and is subject to a number of risks. For example, if the Group is not able to
achieve a consensus amongst its airline customers in support of capital investment projects, this could affect the
willingness of the CAA to include the costs of such projects in the RAB. Difficulties in obtaining or discharging the
requirements of any requisite permits, consents, including environmental consents, licences, planning permissions,
compulsory purchase orders, airspace change consents (and related legal challenges) or easements could adversely affect

17


-----

the design or increase the cost of the capital expenditure projects or delay or prevent the completion of a project or the
commencement of its commercial operation. Although contractors typically share in cost and schedule risks, the Group
may face higher than expected construction costs and delays, not all of which may be permitted by the CAA to be included
in Heathrow Airport’s RAB, and possible shortages of equipment, materials and labour due to the number of major
construction projects in the London area.

The Group’s planned capital expenditure programme has a large number of interdependent programmes of work and a
reliance on suitably qualified and experienced personnel for the delivery of projects.

The commencement of commercial operation of a newly constructed facility may also give rise to start-up problems, such
as the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, or lack of readiness of airline operators, closure of facilities and
disruptions of operations. The Group’s construction contracts may contain restricted remedies or limitations on liability
such that any such sums claimed or amounts paid may be insufficient to cover the financial impact of breach of contract.
The ability of contractors to meet their financial or other liabilities cannot be assured.

The failure of the Group to recognise, plan for and manage the extent of the impact of construction projects (including the
potential expansion of Heathrow Airport) could result in projects overrunning budgets, disruption to Heathrow Airport’s
day-to-day operations, capital expenditure trigger rebates to airlines, unsatisfactory facilities at Heathrow Airport, safety
and security performance deficiencies and higher than expected operating costs. Any of these could impact the Group’s
reputation and, consequently, have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_The potential expansion of Heathrow Airport could be delayed due to factors outside the Group’s control._**

On 25 October 2016, the UK Government announced its decision to support the expansion of Heathrow Airport. The
proposed expansion of Heathrow Airport is expected to include the construction of a new runway north west of Heathrow
Airport, related enabling infrastructure and new taxiway systems, an additional main terminal and Satellite building,
automated baggage facilities and passenger transit systems for ease of movement around Heathrow Airport (the “North
**West Runway Scheme”). The UK Government’s decision follows the recommendation of the Airports Commission on 1**
July 2015. The potential expansion of Heathrow Airport will be a development defined as a Nationally Significant
Infrastructure Project (“NSIP”) under the Planning Act 2008 (the “Act”). On 2 February 2017, the UK Government
published a draft National Policy Statement (“NPS”) for public consultation and scrutiny by the UK Parliamentary
pursuant to the Act. The draft NPS provides planning policy support for the North West Runway Scheme.

The expansion of Heathrow Airport will require a number of steps, including but not limited to:

   - the designation of the final NPS by the Secretary of State for Transport, expected to follow a vote on the final
NPS in the UK Parliament;

   - the grant of a Development Consent Order (“DCO”) by the Secretary of State for Transport following a detailed
application submitted by Heathrow and a public examination process;

   - the grant of any other planning consents (including, for example, for early uses that must be displaced to facilitate
development relating to expansion) and/or environmental licences and permits; and

   - airspace change consent to make changes to the airspace around Heathrow Airport to support the North West
Runway Scheme;

   - sustained political support for the expansion of Heathrow Airport, in particular ahead of any designation of the
NPS;

   - engagement and formal consultation with Heathrow Airport’s local communities and the wider public;

   - engagement and formal consultation with Heathrow Airport’s airline community;

   - engagement and formal consultation with neighbouring and regional local authorities and other statutory bodies
(including Transport for London, the Environment Agency and Natural England);

   - engagement in relation to and influence of changes to regulation, legislation and government policy;

   - engagement with the aviation industry;

   - successfully defending legal or other challenges to the expansion of Heathrow Airport;

   - accessing capital markets to fund the expansion of Heathrow Airport; and

   - the construction, delivery and operation of an expanded Heathrow Airport (including in accordance with the
requirements of any/all consents and permits obtained).

-----

While the Group is undertaking significant activity to secure the proposed expansion of Heathrow Airport (see _Business_
_Expansion of Heathrow Airport’), the expansion of Heathrow Airport is necessarily subject to certain factors and processes_
outside the control of the Group.

Any failure to secure or deliver any of the necessary steps required in connection with the expansion of Heathrow Airport
as expected could in turn prevent the potential expansion of Heathrow Airport and prevent the recovery of costs incurred
by the Group in relation to expansion, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on the Group’s reputation,
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Any delay in securing or delivering any of the necessary steps required in connection with the expansion of Heathrow
Airport as expected could in turn delay the potential expansion of Heathrow Airport, and any such delay could in turn lead
to cost overruns and the lack of available resources relating to the construction, delivery and operation of an expanded
Heathrow Airport, as well as affect Heathrow Airport’s day-to-day operations, which could in turn have a material adverse
effect on the Group’s reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group companies face potential secondary liabilities as members of the Heathrow Airport Holdings Group._**

The Group is part of the larger Heathrow Airport Holdings Group. The Group could, in certain circumstances, face
secondary liabilities in respect of obligations of other Heathrow Airport Holdings Group entities, including tax obligations,
which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Incidents could occur at Heathrow Airport._**

Airports are exposed to the risk of incidents, including accidents, as a result of a number of factors, including extreme
weather conditions, equipment failure, human error and terrorist activities. These incidents could result in injury or loss of
human life, damage to airport infrastructure and short- or long-term closure of Heathrow Airport’s facilities and may have
an impact on passenger traffic levels, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_The Group’s insurance coverage might not be adequate or available in all circumstances._**

The Group benefits from insurance cover to protect against key insurable risks including terrorism and business
interruption. Cover may not be adequate to cover lost income, reinstatement costs, increased expenses or other liabilities.
Moreover, there can be no assurance that if insurance cover is cancelled or not renewed, replacement cover will be
available at commercially reasonable rates or at all.

The Group may not have, or may cease to have, insurance cover if the loss is not covered under, or is excluded from, an
insurance policy including by virtue of a deductible applying, exhaustion of applicable cover limits or a policy operating as
an excess policy or if the relevant insurer successfully avails itself of defences available to it, such as breach of disclosure
duties, breach of policy condition or misrepresentation.

Insurance cover for the Group is currently, and may in the future be, provided by a combination of insurance market
entities and captive insurance companies owned by, or affiliated with, Heathrow Airport Holdings or its ultimate
shareholders. Any of these insurers could cease to offer current insurance cover, become insolvent or lose their licences or
authorisations. Any failure to obtain insurance or to collect under relevant insurance policies could have a material adverse
effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Heathrow and Heathrow Express (together, “the Operating Companies” and each, an “Operating Company”) could be_**
**_subject to periodic increase in pension cash contributions in the future._**

Under the Shared Services Agreement, LHR Airports is entitled to pass its pension costs on to the Operating Companies.
The costs of the pension schemes, primarily in relation to the defined benefit pension scheme (the “Pension Scheme”),
may vary from time to time (for instance as a result of fluctuation in investment values or as a result of changes to actuarial
assumptions). The Group expects pension costs, including the costs of reducing any deficit, to be treated by the CAA as
operating costs in setting price caps, but there is no guarantee that the CAA will do so.

In July 2016, the trustee of the Pension Scheme concluded a formal actuarial valuation of the scheme. The valuation was
carried out as at 30 September 2015 and took into account changes implemented to reduce the scheme’s liabilities. These
changes were the introduction of an annual cap on future increases in pensionable pay for active members and a reduction
in both the accrual rate for future service and inflationary increases for those future service pensions whilst in payment.
The valuation indicated a scheme deficit of £228 million calculated using the trustees’ actuarial assumptions. As part of
the valuation process, LHR Airports and the Pension Scheme’s trustee agreed that the annual deficit recovery payment into
the Pension Scheme would decrease from £27 million to £23 million that is intended to eliminate the deficit by 2022.

19


-----

The Pension Scheme s trustee is a Borrower Secured Creditor pursuant to the STID and ranks equally in an amount up to
£284 million with senior (Class A) debt. The extent of any deficit or surplus to the Pension Scheme, which may vary
significantly from one accounting period to another, results from factors outside the control of the Group.

Increases in the Group’s pension cash contributions could, because they are not fully taken into account by the CAA in
setting price caps, have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. See
“Business- Pensions”.

**_The Group faces a number of operational risks outside its control._**

The operation of an airport is a complex undertaking that is subject to a number of factors outside the control of the Group.
These factors include weather conditions, variable aircraft movements and traffic congestion. In addition, the Secretary of
State for Transport has powers under the Airports Act 2006 to give directions to airport operators in the interests of
national security, including closure of airports. Given the nature of these factors, it is not possible to accurately predict
their future impact on airport operations from past performance, and any impact from such factors could have a material
adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Operations and passenger experience at Heathrow Airport depends upon third parties, whose performance the Group is_**
**_unable to control._**

The Group depends on the co-operation of a large number of third parties, including government agencies and business
partners, to provide essential functions, such as air traffic control, border control, utilities infrastructure, the management
of fuel storage and distribution assets, baggage system operation and maintenance, passenger check-in, re-fuelling, rescue
and firefighting services, utilities provision and catering. The Group works to manage its relationship with such third
parties, for example the Group’s management of contracts with third party suppliers is underpinned by robust and
responsible procurement practices which involve the consideration of the resilience and sustainability of third party
suppliers before contracts are entered into with such third parties, and the frequent monitoring of the operational
performance of such third parties once contracts are commenced. There can be no guarantee that the Group’s management
of third parties will be effective, and the Group’s business operations and the experience of passengers at Heathrow
Airport may be affected if these third parties do not adequately perform the services they are required to provide. In
particular, a failure by these third parties to appropriately respond to passenger volumes, accidents, fire, technical defects
or failures in IT or data processing may cause flight delays, damage to facilities, and the cancellation of airport services.
Any of these events or a combination of events related to the performance of third parties could have a material adverse
effect on the Group's business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group companies enter into contracts with third parties which require them to give representations, covenants and_**
**_indemnities, which could expose the Group to litigation._**

The Group companies enter into contracts with third parties under which they have given or will give representations,
covenants and indemnities as part of the transactions to which the contracts relate. In connection with sales of assets or
shares, Heathrow (AH) as seller has been required to provide various warranties. Entry into such contracts gives rise to a
risk of litigation relating to the representations, covenants and indemnities which, if significant, could have a material
adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group is dependent on LHR Airports as the Shared Services Provider to operate its businesses._**

LHR Airports employs the staff assigned to Heathrow. Pursuant to the Shared Services Agreement, LHR Airports also
provides various central support services (including senior management and strategic direction), administration, cash
management and operational services, including the provision of IT services and staff, to the Operating Companies as
described in more detail in “Business – Shared Services”. From 1 January 2013, following the divestment of Gatwick
Airport and in light of the (at that time) expected divestment of Stansted Airport and to reflect more accurately the current
organisation and economic reality, LHR Airports sub-contracted the majority of these services to Heathrow. Heathrow, as
a subcontractor for LHR Airports, provides certain central support services to Heathrow Express. Whilst the Shared
Services Agreement contains provisions that are designed to assist with the transfer of employees and services to the
Operating Companies or a replacement services provider, if the Shared Services Agreement were terminated, there can be
no assurance that transfers will be effected in a manner that does not have a material adverse effect on the Group’s
business, financial condition and results of operations.

A significant number of contracts for third-party IT systems and IT support important to the Group’s operations are in the
name of LHR Airports and would be terminable by the contract counterparties if LHR Airports were to become insolvent.
While steps may be taken to seek to minimise the impact of such termination provisions, and there may be commercial
reasons why the contract counterparties would not elect to terminate if they are being paid for the continued use of the
relevant IT system or IT support, there is a risk that the Group’s access to IT systems and IT support may be negatively
affected by an insolvency of LHR Airports, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group could face operational disruption, inconvenience to passengers and long term reputational damage as a_**
**_result of compromises to the security of those affected by the activities of the Group._**

The Group is responsible for ensuring that its assets, infrastructure, human and electronic systems and processes meet the
minimum statutory requirements to protect aviation security, deliver high security standards and build confidence with
regulators, airlines and passengers. It also needs to ensure that its assets, infrastructure, human and electronic systems are
protected from theft, damage or intrusion.

The Group has a statutory and moral responsibility to ensure aviation security and safeguard the welfare and safety of
staff, business partners and the public who may be affected by the activities of the Group.

Security risks are mitigated by adopting and enforcing rigorous policies and procedures supported by professional training
and by investment in leading edge security technology. The Group works closely with airlines and government agencies,
including the police, in building a framework to establish joint accountabilities for airport security and shared ownership
of risk, thus ensuring security measures remain both flexible and proportionate to the prevailing threat environment.

While the Group is taking steps to discharge its responsibilities effectively and to avoid compromises to the safety and
security of those affected by the activities of the Group, there can be no guarantee that steps taken by the Group will be
effective. A failure to exercise this responsibility effectively could result in operational disruption, inconvenience to
passengers and long-term damage to the Group’s reputation, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on the
Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**REGULATORY RISKS**

**_Heathrow is subject to economic regulation by the Civil Aviation Authority, which is subject to change._**

Heathrow is subject to economic regulation that results in, among other things, the setting of the price caps on certain of its
charges by the CAA. The CAA published its final decision in relation to economic regulation at Heathrow Airport for the
period from 1 April 2014 to 31 December 2018, Q6, on 10 January 2014 which details CAA price controls for the period
and pursuant to which the maximum allowable annual change to the yield per passenger will be RPI-1.5 per cent. In
December 2016, the CAA published modifications to the licence issued to Heathrow (which took effect from 1 February
2017) extending Heathrow’s current regulatory period by one year so that it will end on 31 December 2019 and rolling
over the current price control of RPI-1.5 per cent. for the additional year. See “Airport Regulation—Heathrow Price
_Regulation—Key Elements of the CAA’s Q6 Decision”._

The CAA has established performance-linked requirements which can negatively impact aeronautical income. For
example, the permitted yield in respect of airport charges at Heathrow Airport can be reduced if prescribed milestones are
not met on certain capital investment projects. In addition, under the service quality rebate scheme for the current
regulatory period, failure to meet specified targets relating to, among other things, airport cleanliness, security queuing
times, flight information displays and stand and jetty availability can result in rebates to airline customers of up to 7 per
cent. of airport charges. See “Airport Regulation – Heathrow Price Regulation – SQR Scheme”.

The Group works to mitigate the risk of an adverse change to the economic regulation of Heathrow as a result of the
CAA’s reviews by having in place a dedicated project team to ensure full compliance with regulatory requirements and to
establish and maintain a sound relationship with the CAA and advise the Group on regulatory matters. The regulatory
framework also requires formal engagement with airline customers, and the Group invites airlines to send representatives
to engagement fora such as joint steering groups to mitigate the risk of adverse airline relations. Key stakeholders are
engaged on a joint planning basis which provides airlines with the opportunity to articulate their views and on-going
requirements.

There can be no assurance that the Group’s strategy for mitigating the risks associated with the economic regulation of
Heathrow set out above will be successful, nor that the current or future price caps set by the CAA will be sufficient to
allow Heathrow to operate at a profit; nor that the present price caps will be increased or at least maintained at current
levels; nor that the methodology of the review process at subsequent reviews will be consistent with previous practice, any
of which could result in a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Heathrow is subject to an economic licensing regime._**

Under the legislative framework, Heathrow operates under a licence granted by the CAA. Heathrow’s licence will remain
in force in perpetuity, however, in certain limited circumstances, such as a continued failure by Heathrow to comply with
the conditions of the licence, the licence may be revoked by the CAA. For more information on the economic licensing
regime, see “Airport Regulation – Principles of Economic Regulation” and “Airport Regulation – Heathrow Price
_Regulation”. Any revocation of the licence could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial_
condition and results of operations.

21


-----

Additionally, the licence may be amended by the CAA in the future through a prescribed licence modification process.
Although this will be subject to a right of appeal by Heathrow, the licence could be amended in a way that adversely
affected the ability of the Group to finance its business at reasonable rates which could have a material adverse effect on
the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group could face other strategic, regulatory and public policy constraints._**

Income and/or operations at Heathrow Airport could be adversely affected by changes in public policy regarding route
licensing, the “use it or lose it” rule under which airlines are required to fly 80 per cent. of their slots or sacrifice them to
other airlines, changes to the conditions for the maintenance of the Heathrow Airport aerodrome licence, security and
safety, immigration and border controls, airport development, environmental policy, tax, air passenger duty or the
provision of airport capacity. In the event that unforeseen strategic, regulatory and/or public policy constraints are
imposed, this could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group’s revenue could decline as a result of changes in the Group’s operating environment._**

Changes in the Group’s operating environment, such as long-term changes in passenger demand for air travel, could lead
to a misaligned operational capacity within the Group. While the Group carries out evaluations through a series of scenario
planning exercises, there can be no assurance that the Group can identify the timing or period of any such changes or that
once identified, the Group will be able to realign the operational capacity of the Group and implement change management
successfully which could lead to a shortfall in the Group’s revenue.

**_The Group could face costs related to environmental, health and safety and planning considerations._**

The Group’s business is affected by a wide variety of EU and UK environmental, health and safety and planning laws and
requirements. The Group’s existing operations may be impacted by a number of environmental and planning factors,
including those involving aircraft movements; climate change; air quality (including emissions standards); noise; energy
use and efficiency; soil and water pollution arising from airport operations; discharges and surface water drainage; land
and groundwater contamination; flooding; drought; asbestos in premises and exposure to asbestos; and waste handling,
management and disposal.

The Group consults and engages with the community in which it operates to ensure the concerns of the community are
taken into account. The Group also has in place proactive environmental management systems and employee training
programmes are embedded within the Group’s operations through clear environmental strategies and resource
conservation initiatives.

The Group recognises that a failure to exercise its responsibility to ensure that it safeguards the welfare and safety of its
people, business partners and the public who may be affected by the Group’s activities effectively risks operational
disruption, inconvenience to passengers and long-term damage to the Group’s reputation which could in turn have a
material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Group’s safety
management system includes risk assessment processes for all activities entailing significant risk and proportionate control
measures employed to safeguard everyone impacted by the Group’s business. The Group also operates robust asset
management processes to ensure property and equipment remains safe. Governance, led by the airport’s senior
management teams, and assurance processes are used to ensure that controls around health and safety risks remain
effective and continuous improvement in encouraged.

Compliance with present or future environmental, health and safety and planning requirements may be costly and timeconsuming and interfere with the Group’s existing activities and operations. Non-compliance, in particular with
environmental laws and requirements, could have a negative impact on the Group’s reputation which could in turn
jeopardise the Group’s licence to operate. The CAA has to date taken environmental costs incurred by the Group into
account when determining the RAB and in setting price caps. The CAA has not indicated that it intends to change its
policy in this regard in the future, but, if it were to do so, this could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.

22


-----

**_The Group could face fines for non compliance with competition laws and regulations_**

Competition authorities exercise considerable discretion in setting levels of fines for non-compliance with competition
laws and regulations. Given the position of Heathrow Airport in certain markets, any failure to comply with applicable
competition laws and regulations may result in the Group incurring substantial fines or settlement costs, as well as
suffering significant reputational damage, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_Non-compliance with the Group’s internal corporate governance requirements could have a significant impact on the_**
**_Group’s reputation and brand._**

The Group has in place internal corporate governance requirements based on applicable laws, rules and requirements such
as the Bribery Act 2010. To ensure that the Group’s operations are executed in accordance with these requirements, the
Group’s management processes include a Code of Professional Conduct and Group policies as well as a Group approvals
procedure which governs the Group’s processes and operations. The Group regularly performs communication and
training in these areas, and monitors and audits internal compliance with these requirements. There is however no
guarantee that violations of the Group’s internal corporate governance requirements will not occur, which could have
material adverse effects on the Group’s reputation and brand, and result in fines which could in turn have a material
adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Future regulatory settlements may not allow for increased operating costs._**

Operating costs may differ from projections. There can be no assurance that future price caps set by the CAA will be
sufficient to allow Heathrow to cover its operating costs which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**FINANCING RISKS**

**_The Group is subject to exposure on its hedging arrangements._**

Whilst the Group operates a hedging programme in accordance with the hedging policy under the terms of the Senior
Borrower Group Indebtedness, it is not required to fully or perfectly hedge its present or future interest rate, foreign
currency or inflation exposure and may not in practice do so. The hedging policy appears as Schedule 5 to the Common
Terms Agreement which is incorporated by reference in this Prospectus. The Group is subject to the creditworthiness of,
and in certain circumstances early termination of the hedging arrangements by, hedge counterparties.

Changes in interest, foreign currency and inflation rates, and exposure to hedge counterparty risk, could have a material
adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Risks of High Leverage_**

**_A significant portion of the Group’s cash flow from operations is dedicated to debt payments._**

Because of the secured nature of its borrowings and the structure that applies to them, the Group has been able to raise
more debt than would typically be the case for an unsecured borrower. As a result, a greater portion of the Group's cash
flow from operations is dedicated to payments on its debt obligations, thus reducing its flexibility to deal with significant
financial underperformance. This may increase the Group's vulnerability to any economic downturn in its business or to
adverse industry conditions, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Given its leverage position, the Group will need to raise further debt from time to time._**

The Group will need to raise further debt from time to time in order, among other things, to:

(a) finance future capital expenditure; and

(b) enable it to refinance and/or repay indebtedness, including the Notes, as such indebtedness becomes due.

There can be no assurance that the Group will be able to raise future finance on terms that are economically viable or at all.
For instance, events in the credit markets in 2007 and 2008, and regulatory uncertainty in 2009, significantly restricted the
Group’s ability to raise finance. An inability to refinance its indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on the
Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, under the terms of the Senior Borrower Group Indebtedness, if Heathrow is unable to replace a liquidity
facility under certain circumstances, it will not be permitted to incur any further indebtedness, including issuing bonds
under the multicurrency bond programme of Heathrow Funding Limited.

23


-----

**_Ability to incur more debt._**

The Group may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future. Neither the terms of the Notes nor the Issuer
Facilities prohibit the Group from incurring more indebtedness (subject to satisfaction of certain conditions). If new debt is
added to the Group's current debt levels, the related risks that the Group now faces could intensify.

**_The Group’s ability to obtain deductions on interest incurred on external debt could be restricted_**

On 5 October 2015, the OECD published final recommendations for new, or amendments to existing, tax laws arising
from its BEPS project (the "OECD proposals"). The OECD proposals include recommendations as to best practice
concerning limits on the deductibility of interest expense for corporate tax payers, based on certain ratios of net interest
expenditure to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”).

Draft legislation has been proposed which, if enacted as proposed, would limit the deductibility of interest expense for UK
corporation tax payers potentially with effect from 1 April 2017. The draft legislation applies a fixed ratio rule which
limits a group’s UK tax deductions for net interest expense to 30 per cent. of UK “tax-based” EBITDA. The draft
legislation also contains a group ratio rule which is intended to allow groups that are highly leveraged for commercial
reasons to obtain a higher level of net interest deductions, up to a limit in line with the group’s overall external gearing
position, and a public infrastructure exemption aimed at ensuring that any restriction does not impede the provision of
external finance used to fund taxable UK public infrastructure. There will be targeted exclusions for related party debt.
Following engagement with HM Treasury and HM Revenue & Customs, the Group currently expects to be largely
protected from the 30 per cent. cap imposed by the fixed ratio rule by virtue of the public infrastructure exemption and the
group ratio rule.

The exact form of the final rules is unknown as at the date of this Prospectus. If the new rules restrict the ability of the
Group or the Issuer to claim deductions for all or part of their interest expenses, this may have an adverse effect on the
financial position of the Group or the Issuer. It is unclear what impact the UK general election will have on the content or
implementation of the proposed legislation.

**OTHER LEGAL RISKS**

**_General risk relating to the impact of the UK exiting the European Union._**

In a referendum held on 23 June 2016, the UK voted to leave the EU. On 29 March 2017 the UK formally began the
process of leaving the EU by notifying the European Council of its intention to do so, under Article 50 of the Treaty on
European Union (“Article 50”). Until the UK formally leaves the EU, it remains a member state of the EU and is bound by
applicable EU laws and regulations.

It is, at this stage, uncertain to what extent EU laws and regulations will be applicable once the UK formally exits the EU,
what transitional arrangements, if any, will be implemented while negotiations are on-going, and what arrangements will
eventually exist between the UK and the EU, and the UK and other countries. It is therefore not possible at this point to
determine the precise impact that the referendum, the UK’s departure from the EU and/or any related matters may have on
the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Possible risks to the Group could include, but are not
limited to:

   - macro-economic factors, including lower economic growth in the UK, greater volatility in the currency markets, a
weakening pound and the introduction of new trade barriers, which may have a negative impact on Heathrow
Airport’s traffic and the cost of travel, and in turn the demand for air travel;

   - market restrictions, including the UK losing its access to the single aviation market, which has removed
commercial restrictions on fares and capacities for European airlines, loss of access for UK airlines to use intraEU routes without permits or authorisation and the UK losing the benefit of other significant air service
agreements, such as the Open Skies Agreement; and

   - operational factors, including changes to aviation and general legislation and regulations, such as additional
security and border controls and restrictions on the free movement of labour.

Any of these possible factors and restrictions could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_General risk of change of law._**

It is possible that, whether as a result of case law or through statute, changes in law, rules or regulations (including changes
in tax regimes) applicable to the Group, or their interpretation or application, either generally or following any exit by the
UK from the EU, could result in the Group’s debt financing arrangements as originally structured no longer having the
anticipated effect or could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of

operations and/or could adversely affect the rights, priorities of payments and/or treatment of holdings in the Notes for
Noteholders.

**_The Group faces potential secondary (and joint and several) tax liabilities._**

Where a company fails to discharge certain tax liabilities within a specified time period, UK tax law imposes, in certain
circumstances, secondary liability for those overdue taxes on other companies that are or have been members of the same
group of companies, or are or have been under common control, for tax purposes with the company that has not discharged
its tax liabilities. With respect to VAT groupings, in certain circumstances members of the Group may also face joint and
several liability.

If any secondary (or joint and several) tax liabilities arise in the Issuer or other members of the Group, which are not
discharged by other members of the wider Heathrow Airport Holdings Group, and are of significant amounts, the Issuer or
other members of the Group could be adversely affected.

**_UK insolvency law may impact the rights of creditors including the Noteholders in certain circumstances._**

The English insolvency statutes empower English courts to make an administration order in respect of an English
company. An administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that the relevant company is or is likely to become
“unable to pay its debts” and that the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. In
addition, the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” over the assets of an English company may appoint an administrator
out of court, provided such floating charge has become enforceable. In this case the prospective administrator must be
satisfied that the purpose of administration is reasonably likely to be achieved. An English company or the directors of
such company may also appoint an administrator out of court. The purpose of an administration comprises three parts
which must be looked at successively: rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable,
achieving a better result for the company's creditors as a whole or, if neither of those objectives are reasonably practicable,
and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realising property to make a distribution
to secured or preferred creditors.

The rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are particularly curtailed in an administration. Upon the appointment
of an administrator, no step may be taken to enforce security over the company's property, except with the consent of the
administrator or leave of the court. The same requirements for consent or leave apply to the commencement or institution
of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress or diligence) against the company or property of the
company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for leave, in light of the
hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above.

Accordingly, if the Issuer was to enter into administration proceedings, the Notes and the related security from the Issuer
could not be enforced while the relevant company was in administration, without the leave of the court or consent of the
administrator. There can be no assurance that the security agent would obtain this leave of the court or consent of the
administrator.

In addition, an administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain requirements under the
Insolvency Act 1986, dispose of the property of a company in administration. However, the general prohibition against
enforcement by secured creditors without consent of the administrator or leave of the Court, and the administrators' powers
with respect to floating and other security, do not apply to any security interest created or arising under a financial
collateral arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Agreements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (UK). A
financial collateral arrangement includes (subject to certain other conditions) a pledge over shares in a company, where
both the collateral provider and collateral taker are non-natural persons.

Under English insolvency law, the liquidator or administrator of a company may, among other things, apply to the court to
unwind a transaction entered into by such company, if such company was unable to pay its debts (as defined in section 123
of the Insolvency Act 1986) at the time of, or as a result of, the transaction and enters into liquidation or administration
proceedings within two years of the completion of the transaction. A transaction might be subject to a challenge if it was
entered into by a company “at an undervalue”, that is, it involved a gift by the company or the company received
consideration of less value than the benefit given by such company. However, a court generally will not intervene if a
company entered into the transaction in good faith for the purpose of carrying on its business and at the time it did so there
were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit such company. The Issuer believes that the Notes will
not be issued on terms which would amount to a transaction at an undervalue, that the offering is in good faith for the
purposes of carrying on the Group's business and that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction will
benefit the Group. However, there can be no assurance that the issuance of the Notes will not be challenged by a liquidator
or administrator or that a court would support this analysis.

In addition, if it can be shown that a transaction entered into by an English company was made for less than fair value and
was made to shield assets from creditors, then the transaction may be set aside as a transaction defrauding creditors. Any
person who is a “victim” of the transaction, and not just liquidators or administrators, may assert such a claim. There is no

25


-----

statutory time limit within which a claim must be made and the company need not be insolvent at the time of the
transaction.

If the Issuer was to commence administration proceedings, the Notes and the related security could not be enforced while
the relevant company was in administration.

The holder of a qualifying floating charge that has been created since 15 September 2003 over all or substantially all of the
assets of an English company can generally no longer appoint an administrative receiver of that company. There is,
however, an exception to this rule that applies to certain capital markets transactions that are expected to incur at least £50
million of debt.

Any interest accruing under or in respect of the Notes for any period from the date of commencement of administration or
liquidation proceedings, to the extent not fully covered by the assets securing the Notes, could be recovered by holders of
the Notes only from any surplus remaining after payment of all other debts provided in the proceeding and interest accrued
but unpaid up to the date of the commencement of the proceeding.

Under English insolvency law, certain preferential claims, including unpaid contributions to occupational pension schemes
in respect of the twelve-month period prior to insolvency and unpaid employees' remuneration in respect of the four-month
period prior to insolvency, will, while ranking behind the claims of holders of fixed security, rank ahead of floating
charges. In addition, a prescribed part of floating charge realisations (being 50 per cent. of the first £10,000 of net
realisations and 20 per cent. of the net realisations thereafter, up to a maximum of £600,000) is required to be set aside for
the benefit of unsecured creditors and, as such, ranks ahead of the relevant floating charge.

**RISKS RELATING TO THE NOTES**

**_The Issuer depends on subsidiaries for payments._**

The Issuer is a holding company with no material assets other than the shares of its subsidiary, Heathrow (SP) Limited. All
of the Issuer's revenue is generated by the Operating Companies. Accordingly, almost all of the Issuer's cash flow is
generated by the Operating Companies. Therefore, the Issuer's ability to make payments on its indebtedness and to fund its
other obligations is dependent not only on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate cash, but also on the ability of its
subsidiaries to distribute cash to it in the form of dividends, fees, interest, loans or otherwise.

However, the Issuer's subsidiaries face various restrictions in their ability to distribute cash to the Issuer. The Senior
Borrower Group must satisfy certain restricted payment covenants and other conditions before it may make distributions to
the Issuer. Business performance and local accounting and tax rules may limit the amount of retained earnings, which is in
many cases the basis of dividend payments.

**_The Notes are subordinated to liabilities of the Issuer's subsidiaries._**

The Issuer's subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any
amounts due pursuant to any debt incurred by the Issuer or to make any funds available whether by dividends, fees, loans
or other payments. Any right of the Issuer to receive any assets of any of its subsidiaries upon liquidation, dissolution,
winding up, receivership, reorganisation, assignment for the benefit of creditors, marshalling of assets and liabilities or any
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings (and the consequent right of the holders of the Issuer's indebtedness to
participate in the distribution of, or to realise proceeds from, those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of
any such subsidiary's creditors (including trade creditors and holders of debt issued by such subsidiary). Accordingly, the
Notes will be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the Issuer's subsidiaries. As at 31 March 2017, the Issuer's
subsidiaries had £16,756 million of outstanding liabilities, including outstanding indebtedness. The terms and conditions
of the Notes do not prohibit the Issuer's subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness.

**_The Issuer may not be able to repurchase Notes on change of control._**

Upon a Change of Control (as defined under “Terms and Conditions of the Notes—Definitions”), the Issuer will be
required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at 101 per cent. of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
interest. The source of funds for any such purchase of the Notes will be the Issuer's available cash or cash generated from
the Operating Companies' operations or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. The Issuer
may not be able to satisfy its obligations to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control because it may not have
sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the Notes that are tendered upon a change of control.

**_Liquidity of the Notes could be limited and there could be an absence of a secondary market for the Notes._**

There can be no assurance that a secondary market for the Notes will develop or, if a secondary market does develop for
any of the Notes issued after the date of this Prospectus, that it will provide any holder of Notes with liquidity or that any
such liquidity will continue for the life of the Notes. Consequently, any purchaser of the Notes must be prepared to hold
such Notes for an indefinite period of time or until final redemption or maturity of the Notes.

26


-----

The liquidity and market value at any time of the Notes are affected by, among other things, the market view of the credit
risk of such Notes and will generally fluctuate with general interest rate fluctuations, general economic conditions, the
condition of certain financial markets, international political events and the performance and financial condition of the
Group.

**_Rating of the Notes._**

The ratings assigned by the rating agencies to the Notes reflect only the views of the rating agencies and in assigning the
ratings the rating agencies take into consideration the credit quality of the Group and structural features and other aspects
of the transaction, including counterparty risk. There is no assurance that any such ratings will continue for any period of
time or that they will not be reviewed, revised, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies as a result of
changes in, or unavailability of, information or if, in the rating agencies' judgment, circumstances so warrant. If any rating
assigned to the Notes is lowered or withdrawn, the market value of the Notes may be reduced. Future events, including
events affecting the Group and/or circumstances relating to the airport industry generally, could have an adverse impact on
the ratings of the Notes.

**_Compliance with covenants may be affected by events beyond the Issuer’s control._**

The terms and conditions of the Notes, the 2019 Notes, the 2025 Notes and the Issuer Facilities limit the Group's ability to,
among other things, incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends or make other distributions; make investments; sell
assets; enter into agreements restricting the ability of the Issuer's subsidiaries to pay dividends; consolidate, merge, sell or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Group's assets; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and provide
security. In addition, the terms and conditions of the Notes require that, subject to certain cure rights, Group RAR may not
be greater than 92.5 per cent. as at any Relevant Testing Date and, until such time as the 2019 Notes either mature, are
repaid or consent is obtained to amend the Group RAR restrictions, the terms and conditions of the 2019 Notes require
that, subject to certain cure rights, Group RAR may not be greater than 90 per cent. as at any Relevant Testing Date. The
terms and conditions of the Notes, the 2019 Notes, the 2025 Notes and the Issuer Facilities also require that Group ICR
may not be less than 1.0 in respect of any Relevant Testing Period.

The ability of the Issuer to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond the Issuer's
control. If the Issuer breaches any of these covenants or restrictions, it could be in default under the Notes, the 2019 Notes,
the 2025 Notes and the Issuer Facilities. This would permit the lenders under the Issuer Facilities to take certain actions,
including declaring all amounts that the Issuer has borrowed under the Issuer Facilities and other indebtedness to be due
and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. This would also result in an event of default under the Notes, the
the 2019 Notes and the 2025 Notes. The lenders could also refuse to extend further credit under the Issuer Facilities. If the
debt under the Issuer Facilities, the Notes, the 2019 Notes, the 2025 Notes or any other material financing arrangement that
the Issuer enters into were to be accelerated, the Issuer's assets may be insufficient to repay in full the Notes and the
Issuer's other indebtedness.

**_The interests of the Group’s ultimate shareholders may be inconsistent with interests of holders of Notes._**

Ferrovial S.A., Qatar Holding LLC, Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, the Government of Singapore Investment
Corporation, Alinda Capital Partners, China Investment Corporation and Universities Superannuation Scheme, or
investment vehicles controlled or managed on their behalf, indirectly own all of the shares of the Issuer. As a result, these
shareholders have, directly or indirectly, the power, among other things, to affect the Group's legal and capital structure
and its day-to-day operations, as well as the ability to elect and change management and to approve other changes to the
Group's operations. The interests of the Group's ultimate shareholders could conflict with the interests of investors in the
Notes, particularly if the Group encounters financial difficulties or is unable to pay its debts when due. In addition, the
Group's ultimate shareholders may, in the future, own businesses that directly compete with the Group in certain respects
or do business with the Group.

**_Security may be insufficient to repay the Notes._**

If there is an event of default under the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be secured only by the property and assets of
Heathrow (DSH) Limited and the Issuer, which primarily consist of the share capital of the Issuer held by Heathrow
(DSH) Limited and of the share capital of Heathrow (SP) Limited held by the Issuer. To the extent that the claims of the
holders of the Notes, the claims of lenders under the Issuer Facilities and the claims of any other third party creditor that
shares in the Transaction Security in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement exceed the value of the
Transaction Security securing the Notes and other obligations, those claims will rank equally with the claims of the holders
of all other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Notes.

To the extent that other first-priority security interests, pre-existing liens, liens permitted under the terms and conditions of
the Notes and other rights encumber the Transaction Security securing the Notes, those parties may have or may exercise
rights and remedies with respect to the Transaction Security that could adversely affect the value of the security and the
ability of the security agent to realise or foreclose on the security.

27


-----

**_Payments in relation to the Notes are subject to the Intercreditor Agreement._**

The Trustee will accede to an intercreditor agreement with, among others, the agents and representatives of the other
indebtedness secured by the Transaction Security, including the Issuer Facilities, the 2019 Notes, the 2025 Notes and
counterparties to certain hedging obligations. Other creditors may become parties to the Intercreditor Agreement in the
future and share in the Transaction Security. Among other things, the Intercreditor Agreement governs the enforcement of
the security documents, the sharing in any recoveries from such enforcement and the release of the Transaction Security by
the security agent.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the security agent shall act upon the instructions of the secured creditors
representing more than 50 per cent. of the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2019 Notes, the 2025 Notes,
the Notes, any additional notes, the Issuer Facilities, any new credit facilities and certain hedging creditors. The
Intercreditor Agreement further provides that, if the Trustee or holders of the Notes do not respond to a Request (as
defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) within 20 business days, the votes of holders of the Notes will not be counted for,
amongst other things, the purposes of instructing the security agent. These arrangements could be disadvantageous to the
holders of the Notes in a number of respects. For example, other creditors not subject to the Intercreditor Agreement could
commence enforcement action against the Issuer or its subsidiaries during such consultation period, the Issuer or one or
more of its subsidiaries could seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, or the value of certain collateral could
otherwise be impaired or reduced.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the security agent may release certain collateral in connection with sales of
assets pursuant to a permitted disposal or enforcement sale and in other circumstances permitted by the Trust Deed and the
Issuer Facilities. Therefore, such collateral available to secure the Notes could be reduced in connection with the sales of
assets or otherwise, subject to the requirements of the financing documents and the Trust Deed.

The Trust Deed and the Issuer Facilities permit the Issuer, in compliance with the covenants in those agreements, to incur
additional indebtedness secured by liens on the Transaction Security. The Issuer's ability to incur additional debt in the
future secured on the collateral may have the effect of diluting the ratio of the value of such Transaction Security to the
aggregate amount of the obligations secured by the Transaction Security.

**_Book-entry form of Notes._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global form and deposited with a common depositary for Euroclear and
Clearstream, Luxembourg. Interests in the Notes will trade in book-entry form only. The common depositary for Euroclear
and Clearstream, Luxembourg will be the sole holder of the Global Notes representing the Notes. Accordingly, owners of
book-entry interests must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, and non-participants in
Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg must rely on the procedures of the participant through which they own their
interests, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of Notes.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon the
Issuer's solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. The procedures to be
implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights
under the Notes.

**_Modification, waivers and substitution._**

The terms and conditions of the Notes contain provisions for calling meetings of holders of the Notes to consider matters
affecting their interests generally. These provisions permit defined majorities to bind all holders of the Notes including
holders of the Notes who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting and holders of the Notes who voted in a manner
contrary to the majority.

The terms and condition of the Notes also provide that the Trustee may, without the consent of holders of the Notes, agree
to (i) any modification of, or to the waiver or authorisation of any breach or proposed breach of, any of the provisions of
the Notes or the Trust Deed, (ii) determine without the consent of the holders of the Notes that any event of default or
potential event of default shall not be treated as such or (iii) the substitution in place of the Issuer in respect of the Notes of
a new group holding company, in each case in the circumstances and subject to the conditions described in “Terms and
_Conditions of the Notes”._

**INDUSTRY SOURCES AND TERMINOLOGY**

This Prospectus contains certain statistical and other information regarding Heathrow Airport and the markets it serves.

Unless otherwise indicated, the information contained in this Prospectus relating to Heathrow Airport’s market share
and the size of the relevant market sectors is based on Heathrow’s own internal estimates based on regulatory and
analyst reports, special surveys and information published or provided by airlines and other companies, as well as
Heathrow’s own knowledge of the market.

References in this Prospectus to Heathrow Airport’s number of “passengers” refer to the sum of all arriving and
departing passengers, other than in-transit passengers.

Information in this Prospectus relating to Heathrow Airport’s percentage of “international” passengers is based on the
number of its passengers arriving from and departing to destinations that are not in the United Kingdom relative to the
total number of passengers served by Heathrow Airport. Information in this Prospectus relating to Heathrow Airport’s
percentage of “domestic” passengers is based on the number of its passengers arriving from and departing to
destinations that are in the United Kingdom relative to the total number of passengers served by Heathrow Airport.
Accordingly, the information reflects the place of origin or destination of passengers as opposed to their residence.

All information in this Prospectus relating to Heathrow Airport’s percentage of “business” passengers is based on the
number of Heathrow Airport’s passengers who are travelling for reasons related to such passengers’ employment, based
on surveyed information, relative to the total number of passengers served by Heathrow Airport. All information
relating to Heathrow Airport's percentage of “leisure” passengers is based on the number of Heathrow Airport’s
passengers who are not business passengers, relative to the total number of passengers served by Heathrow Airport.

“ATM” or “Air Transport Movement” means a flight carried out for commercial purposes and includes scheduled
flights operating according to a published timetable, charter flights and all-cargo flights. Air transport movement does
not include empty positioning flights and private non-commercial flights.

“European **flights” are flights arriving from or departing to other destinations in Europe (other than domestic flights).**
International “long haul” flights are all flights other than European flights and domestic flights.

“Gate room” refers to the area where passengers board and disembark from their aircraft.

“hub airport” refers to an airport where a significant proportion of passengers transfer between flights in being
transported to their final destination.

“IATA” refers to the International Air Transport Association, a trade association of the world’s airlines which supports
the aviation sector with global standards for airline safety, security, efficiency and sustainability.

“Maximum allowable yield” refers to the maximum amount of aeronautical income per passenger that Heathrow may
charge in each regulatory year for services subject to price regulation by the CAA.

“Pier” refers to an airport passenger building which is connected to a terminal and which houses Gate rooms where
passengers wait to board and disembark from their aircraft. “Satellite” refers to an airport passenger building which is
connected to a terminal and which houses not only Gate rooms but also other passenger handling facilities (for example,
retail facilities) and serves as an extension to the departure lounge.

“Stand” means an aircraft parking stand; these can be ‘pier-served’, which means they are adjacent to the terminal,
enabling passengers to walk directly on and off aircraft parked on the stand via an airbridge, or they can be ‘remote’,
which requires passengers to either be transported by coach or walk between the stand and the terminal.

“Transfer traffic” relates to passengers who use an airport for the sole purpose of connecting from one aircraft to
another. They are counted as both arriving and departing passengers. “Transit” or “In-transit” traffic refers to
passengers who arrive and depart on the same aircraft within 24 hours. “Origin and destination” traffic refers to any
traffic that is not transfer or transit traffic and originates from or terminates at a particular airport.

References to the “Heathrow Express rail service” refer to both the express (non-stop) service and the stopping
service, Heathrow Connect, unless specifically stated otherwise. Where reference is made to CAA publications or data,
efforts have been made to ensure data is reproduced and presented in a similar style to aid comparison and crossreference but may not be identical as a result of modifications made for presentational purposes.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The net proceeds of the issue of the Notes are expected to be used to repay existing indebtedness of the Group and/or its
holding companies, in particular, when combined with new term loans of up to £100 million raised at ADI Finance 2
Limited (“ADIF2”), a holding company of the Group, to repay £310 million in existing term loans at ADIF2.

As at 31 March 2017, gross debt at the Issuer was £963 million, equivalent to 6.3 per cent. of Heathrow’s RAB at that
date. The issuance of the Notes together with the expected use of proceeds outlined above, and the expected drawing of
£75 million of term loans at the Issuer, will result in the amount of gross debt at the Issuer being approximately £1.313
billion (or 8.3 per cent. of Heathrow’s forecast RAB at the time) by the end of 2017.

**BUSINESS**

**OVERVIEW OF HEATHROW AIRPORT**

**Heathrow Airport**

London is the world’s leading global financial centre and a leading worldwide centre of commerce. As London’s largest
airport, and its only international hub, Heathrow Airport is a critical infrastructure asset not only for the UK but for
global finance and commerce.

Heathrow Airport is Europe’s busiest and the world’s seventh busiest airport in terms of total passengers. In 2016
Heathrow Airport handled a record 75.7 million passengers. Heathrow Airport is the primary airport in London, which
is the world’s largest origin and destination aviation market with over 160 million passengers travelling to and from
London annually (Source: CAA Airport Statistics for 2016). Heathrow Airport handles approximately 74 per cent. (in
terms of seats) of all the UK’s scheduled long-haul air traffic (Source: IATA Airport IS schedule for 2016) and its
critical role in the global aviation industry is underlined by the fact that five of the top ten intercontinental long-haul
routes globally pass through Heathrow Airport (Source: IATA Airport IS schedule for 2016).

Heathrow Airport hosts most of the world’s major international airlines and is the worldwide hub of British Airways
and the main European hub of the oneworld airline alliance. It also hosts the other two principal airline alliances of
SkyTeam and Star Alliance. In 2016, British Airways accounted for approximately 52 per cent. of Heathrow Airport’s
ATMs, oneworld 60 per cent. and Star Alliance 18 per cent. (Source: Heathrow).

Heathrow Airport is served by two parallel runways which together have maximum permitted ATMs of 480,000 per
year. In 2016, Heathrow Airport operated at 98.6 per cent. of this limit.

Heathrow Airport provides a wide range of passenger services, including passenger-handling facilities, car parking,
shops, bars and restaurants. Heathrow Airport is served by extensive bus services, London Underground services and
the dedicated Heathrow Express rail service to and from London Paddington Station.

The Group has invested approximately £11 billion transforming Heathrow Airport since 2006, culminating in the
opening of Terminal 5 in 2008 and Terminal 2: The Queen’s Terminal in June 2014. Each of Heathrow Airport’s four
operational terminals is either new or recently refurbished. In 2016, the Group invested £674 million (2015: £627
million). In 2016, Terminal 2 handled 16.5 million passengers (2015: 16.7 million) and Terminal 5 handled 31.9 million
passengers (2015: 33.1 million). Terminal 5 was awarded the World’s Best Airport Terminal by Skytrax for five
consecutive years up to and including 2016. Heathrow Airport was named “Best Airport in Western Europe” by Skytrax
for the third time in 2017 and awarded ACI Europe’s Best Airport Award for the third time in 2016.

In recent years, the Group has maintained a strong focus on operational performance, improving the passenger
experience and investing in new and upgraded facilities. As a result, Heathrow Airport has risen to become one of the
top performing major European hub airport in terms of overall passenger satisfaction. In 2016, 84 per cent. of
passengers rated their Heathrow Airport experience as either “very good” or “excellent”- recognising the improvements
delivered, including the opening of Terminal 5 and Terminal 2: The Queen’s Terminal (2015: 81 per cent.).

The Group generated revenues of £2,807 million and Adjusted EBITDA of £1,682 million for the year ended 31
December 2016.

**REVENUE GENERATION AND ECONOMIC REGULATION**

**Overview**

Heathrow Airport is subject to economic regulation by the CAA. The regulatory system is designed to allow airports to
generate revenues which are sufficient to finance their operating and capital expenditure requirements and provide a
regulated rate of return on their RAB. The CAA sets price caps on the charges Heathrow can levy on airlines for using
the airport’s facilities. The caps take into account Heathrow’s forecast revenues (both aeronautical and nonaeronautical) and costs as well as allowing recovery of capital costs and a return on capital. Details of the regulatory
regime and how the CAA determines price caps are set out in “Airport Regulation”.

Heathrow generates two primary types of income: aeronautical income, which is generated from fees charged to airlines
for use of the airport’s facilities, and non-aeronautical income from a variety of sources. The chart below shows the
breakdown of the £2,807 million total revenue of Heathrow by source for 2016.

**Other, 18%**

**Aeronautical, 60%**

**Retail, 22%**

**_Aeronautical income_**

Aeronautical income reflects the charges levied by Heathrow on the airport’s airline customers. These charges (tariffs)
cannot exceed the regulated maximum allowable yield per passenger.

The tariff structure through which the aeronautical income is recovered from airlines includes three key elements:

_Passenger fees_

- Fees per passenger are based on the number of passengers on board an aircraft, and are levied in respect of all
departing passengers. There is no charge in respect of crew members working on flights.

- Three levels of charge based on route area: domestic, European and rest of world. Transfer and Transit
passengers benefit from a discount.

_Landing charges_

- Landing charges are levied for substantially all aircraft (with certain diplomatic and other flights being
exempted). These are calculated in accordance with the certified maximum take-off weight of the aircraft and are
banded into categories for aircraft weighing less than and those weighing more than sixteen tonnes, which
includes nearly all commercial aircraft. These charges are adjusted, where applicable, in accordance with each
aircraft’s noise-rating, its emissions and the time of day, with landing charges at Heathrow Airport being higher
during peak traffic times than off-peak traffic times.

40


-----

_Parking charges_

  - Aircraft parking charges are levied for each 15 minute slot after 30 minutes (for narrow bodied aircraft) and 90
minutes (for wide bodied aircraft).

The CAA stipulates that the airport must charge non-passenger flights at the same rates as passenger flights. These
flights incur the minimum departure charge which applies when the departing passenger charge falls below this
minimum level.

Heathrow Airport hosts most of the world’s major international airlines and is the worldwide hub of British Airways
and the main European hub of the oneworld airline alliance. It also hosts the other two principal airline alliances of
SkyTeam and Star Alliance. In 2016, British Airways accounted for approximately 52 per cent. of Heathrow Airport’s
ATMs, oneworld 60 per cent. and Star Alliance 18 per cent (Source: Heathrow).

The chart below represents the total aeronautical income[(1)] for Heathrow Airport by airline for 2016:

Source: Heathrow.

(1) Excludes other charges, related primarily to the provision of fixed electrical ground power and pre-conditioned air to aircraft.

**_Non-aeronautical income_**

Heathrow generates non-aeronautical income from a variety of sources. These include:

  - concession fees from retail operators;

  - direct income from car parks, advertising revenue and VIP products;

- the rental of airport premises such as aircraft hangars, warehouses, cargo storage facilities, maintenance
facilities, offices and airline lounges;

  - the provision of facilities such as baggage handling and passenger check-in; and

  - fare revenue from the operation of the Heathrow Express rail service.

**THE GROUP AND ITS OWNERSHIP**
The Group is indirectly owned by investment vehicles controlled or managed by Ferrovial S.A. (25.00 per cent.), Qatar
Holding LLC (20.00 per cent.), Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (12.62 per cent.), the Government of Singapore
Investment Corporation (11.20 per cent.), Alinda Capital Partners (11.18 per cent.), China Investment Corporation
(10.00 per cent.) and Universities Superannuation Scheme (10.00 per cent.). The Group companies are indirect
subsidiaries of LHR Airports. LHR Airports is itself a subsidiary of Heathrow Airport Holdings.

**KEY STRENGTHS**
**Heathrow Airport has a strong position in the South East of England, one of the world’s busiest air traffic**
**markets and a market with growing demand for air travel.**

- Airports are critical to domestic and international travel, trade and communication. London, as the world’s
leading financial and commercial centre, drives significant global business travel into and out of the region.

- Demand to fly to and from London is 15 per cent. higher than any other city in the world (Source: Airports
Commission Final Report, July 2015).

- In 2015, the UK was ranked eighth globally in the international tourist arrivals league and fifth for international
tourism receipts (Source: World Tourism Organization).

- As London’s largest airport, and its only international hub, Heathrow Airport is a critical infrastructure asset not
only for the UK but for global finance and commerce.

- Aviation has demonstrated resilience as a long-term growth industry. Over the period of 2006 to 2016, passenger
traffic through Heathrow Airport increased at a compound annual rate of 1.2 per cent. despite the effects of the
major economic downturn in 2008 and 2009 (Source: Heathrow). Growth in air travel in the South East of
England is expected to continue. Heathrow Airport accounts for approximately half of total passenger traffic in
Greater London, with passenger traffic through the five major airports in the Greater London area at over 160
million passengers in 2016 (Source: CAA Airport Statistics for 2016).

- The scale of infrastructure and geographical requirements necessary to develop a competing airport provide for
very high barriers to entry. These barriers to entry are even more marked for hub airports such as Heathrow
Airport.

**Heathrow Airport has a unique scale, market position and resilience in passenger traffic.**

- Heathrow Airport is Europe’s busiest airport and the world’s seventh busiest in terms of total passengers.

- Heathrow Airport enjoys a unique market position in the UK, being the country’s only hub airport and acting as
the gateway to approximately 74 per cent. (in terms of seats) of all the UK’s scheduled long-haul air traffic
(Source: IATA Airport IS schedules for 2016).

- Heathrow is the largest UK port by value. Heathrow plays a critical role in the UK’s international trade, being
the largest UK port by value and handling over 30 per cent. by value of all UK exports outside the European
Union (Source: UK Trade Info, Heathrow). In 2016, 1.54 million tonnes of cargo passed through the airport.

- Over half of Heathrow Airport’s passengers are non-UK resident and it has an even split between business,
visiting friends and family and leisure traffic. Further, it has a balanced mix of European, North American and
other long haul traffic. As a result, there is a greater diversity of economic and demographic factors affecting the
airport’s passenger demand compared to other UK and international airports.

- A substantial proportion of Heathrow Airport’s passenger traffic is long haul, with 96 long haul destinations
currently served from Heathrow Airport (Source: Heathrow). Heathrow Airport has also been operating close to
its permitted capacity for a number of years reflecting airline demand to use the airport.

**Regulation provides cash flow visibility and mitigates market risk.**

- Heathrow is subject to price regulation by the CAA. This involves the CAA setting caps every five years on the
amount that Heathrow can charge airlines for using its facilities. The price caps are set taking into account
forecast passenger traffic, operating costs and other revenues for Heathrow as well as allowing recovery of
capital costs and a return on capital. In making its determination, the CAA takes into account the actual historic
experience of Heathrow which materially mitigates the market risk faced by Heathrow. This price setting
mechanism provides significant income predictability and cash flow visibility within each regulatory period as
well as protection against longer term cost and revenue risks.

**Proven resilience to market trends, shocks and economic downturns.**

- Heathrow Airport has been resilient to economic downturns and other changes in the air travel market such as
wars, acts of terrorism and the threat of pandemic illnesses. In recent years, demand for air travel in the UK has
tended to return relatively quickly to historic levels following external shocks. The graph below shows that
demand shocks in the UK, such as oil crises in 1973 and 1979, the first Gulf war in 1990, the terrorist attacks of
11 September 2001, the global financial crisis at its height in 2008 and 2009 and the closure of UK airspace in

42


-----

2010, have been followed by periods of renewed growth bringing passenger numbers back to the pre shock
trend.

**Heathrow has consistently demonstrated operational excellence**

- Heathrow has proven track record of operating close to its permitted capacity for a number of years, delivering
large scale construction projects on time and on budget and consistently improving customers’ satisfaction.

Source: Heathrow.

**Heathrow benefits from diversified income sources and serves a variety of market segments.**

Heathrow earns income from a variety of sources, including charges to airlines, concession fees from retail operators,
income from car parks, advertising revenue, the rental of airport premises such as aircraft hangars, cargo storage
facilities, maintenance facilities and offices, the provision of facilities and services such as baggage handling and
passenger check-in and the Heathrow Express rail service.

Heathrow Airport serves a diversified range of major airlines. It is home to British Airways and Virgin Atlantic
Airways and also sizeable operations for many non-UK airlines, particularly from Europe, North America, the Middle
East and Asia. Heathrow Airport’s main customer and airline alliance represent a smaller proportion of operations than
other European hub airports.

Heathrow Airport serves a range of market segments, including business and leisure travellers, origin and destination
and transfer passengers and long and short haul routes.

**HEATHROW’S STRATEGY**
The Group’s strategy is focused on developing Heathrow Airport’s position from one of the best airports in Europe to
one of the best airports in the world.

To support and develop Heathrow Airport’s role as a hub, the Group will continue enabling the success of the major
network airlines operating at Heathrow Airport by investing in further capacity, operational flexibility and resilience at
sustainable charges for airline customers.

For both local and transfer passengers, Heathrow Airport is working continuously to make every journey better through
improved service standards to ensure it remains passengers’ preferred airport. Improving the passenger experience is
supported by ongoing investment in modern airport facilities and operating processes.

43


-----

The Group has four strategic priorities to help deliver its strategy:

  - **Mojo: making Heathrow a great place to work, helping its people fulfil their potential and working together to**
lead change across the airport.

  - **Transforming customer service: aiming to deliver the world’s best passenger experience through working**
with the Heathrow Airport community to transform the service it gives to passengers and airlines.

  - **Beating the plan: aiming to beat the Q6 business plan and deliver a competitive return by growing revenue,**
reducing costs and delivering investments efficiently.

  - **Sustainable growth: working to operate and grow Heathrow Airport sustainably, now and in the future.**

**THE ROLE OF HEATHROW**
Heathrow co-ordinates the activities of the numerous organisations involved in the provision of airport services to
passengers, airlines and other airport users which include:

- providing passengers, airlines and other service providers with the infrastructure and facilities (such as check-in
desks, concourses, Gate rooms, baggage handling facilities and office facilities) needed to optimise operations
and maximise passenger and flight traffic within existing capacity constraints;

- implementing, under government supervision, air transport security measures, including passenger and baggage
inspections. The UK Government has the power to give any airport operator “such directions of a general
character as appear to the Secretary of State to be necessary or expedient in the interests of national security or of
relations with a country or territory outside the UK”;

- developing commercial areas (such as shops, restaurants and car parks) and determining the optimal mix and
location of retail services;

- maintaining and developing airport infrastructure to meet evolving airline and passenger demands;

- ensuring that Heathrow Airport is served by appropriate and adequate ground transport services;

- maximising capacity at Heathrow Airport and setting airport capacity constraints in consultation with NATS, the
airlines and ACL which allocates take-off and landing slots; and

- assigning airlines to terminals in consultation with the airlines, ACL and NATS.

**HEATHROW AIRPORT’S INFRASTRUCTURE, FACILITIES AND ACCESS**

**Overview**

Heathrow Airport commenced operations as London’s principal commercial airport in 1946. The airport’s first
permanent terminal opened in 1955 and the substantial growth in demand for air transport throughout the 1960s and
1970s saw much of the core infrastructure at Heathrow Airport’s Central Terminal Area developed, including the
opening of what is now Terminal 3 in 1961 and Terminal 1 in 1968 and the construction of car parks, public transport
and other operational and administration facilities. Terminal 4 was added in 1986.

In 2008, Terminal 5 opened on the western side of the airport. The terminal has transformed passenger experience and
also operational performance. The main building and its Satellites are positioned perpendicular to the runways, to
maximise the efficient use of land on the airport, delivering operationally efficient taxiway and runway hold processes
for the benefit of the whole campus. As well as delivering passenger, airline and airport benefit in its own right, the
additional terminal capacity created by Terminal 5 provided the space to allow Heathrow to begin renovating and
rebuilding its other terminals. Terminal 5 was named the World’s Best Airport Terminal by Skytrax for five successive
years up to and including 2016.

The first key phase in transforming Heathrow’s existing terminals was the construction of a new Terminal 2. The
original Terminal 2 was closed in late 2009 with demolition of the old terminal infrastructure enabling construction of
the new terminal to commence in mid-2010. In June 2014, the £2.5 billion investment was opened on time and on
budget and attained a high safety record during the construction phase.

The original Terminal 2, opened by Her Majesty the Queen in 1955, was Heathrow's first permanent terminal and was
designed to deal with 1.2 million passengers a year. The new terminal has the capacity to cater for up to 20 million
passengers a year. Airlines and passengers benefit from a £2.5 billion investment in state of the art facilities that include
main terminal and Satellite buildings, a multi-storey short-stay car park and an energy centre supporting the Terminal 2

44


-----

campus and the wider airport. The terminal and Satellite buildings include 24 aircraft stands of which 7 stands are
capable of handling the increasing number of A380 aircraft operating at Heathrow Airport.

The terminal is home to all 24 Star Alliance member airlines operating at Heathrow Airport together with Aer Lingus,
Germanwings, Eurowings and Icelandair. For the Star Alliance airlines, it provides the opportunity to enhance
efficiencies through use of common facilities, processes and personnel. It also enhances the scope for closer commercial
co-operation between alliance members by, for example, capitalising on competitive minimum connection times to
attract greater volumes of transfer passengers. Both these features will further strengthen Heathrow Airport’s
competitive position.

Heathrow Airport’s terminal capacity is currently estimated to be 85 million passengers per year.

In parallel with the work on Heathrow’s terminals, significant investment continues in Heathrow’s baggage
infrastructure. The underground automated baggage system between Terminal 3 and Terminal 5 is now fully
operational, and the Terminal 3 integrated baggage system started operating in March 2015 and was fully operational in
April 2016.

**Runways**

Heathrow Airport’s two parallel runways generally operate in “segregated mode”, with arriving aircraft allocated to one
runway and departing aircraft to the other. To mitigate noise impact to residents living below the approach and
departure routes, the allocation of runways to arriving and departing aircraft is normally swapped at around 3:00 p.m.
each day or as weather conditions necessitate.

The airport is permitted to schedule up to 480,000 ATMs per year and in 2016 Heathrow Airport operated at 98.6 per
cent. of this limit.

**Retail Facilities**

Heathrow Airport has a total of approximately 58,600 square metres of retail space served by over 83 retail clients
operating almost 480 retail outlets. Terminal 5, with over 16,900 square metres of retail space, has significantly
increased the airport’s overall retail portfolio. Heathrow Airport owns over 22,000 public car park spaces that are
available to travellers and the general public. All terminals at Heathrow Airport are served by car rental operators. The
terminals and their approaches provide advertising space, which yields further income.

**Access to Heathrow Airport**

Heathrow Airport’s extensive ground transport links facilitate access to the airport for passengers, cargo transporters
and airport personnel:

- Heathrow Airport is located just off the M4 motorway, linking London and the west of England, and London’s
orbital motorway, the M25.

- Heathrow Express offers a frequent non-stop rail service to and from London Paddington Station. This service is
supplemented by the Heathrow Connect “stopping service”, which provides local access to the airport as well as
connections with train services on the main rail line between London and the west of England.

- Additional direct rail connections to Heathrow Airport are expected in the future following the expected
commencement of Crossrail services between Paddington and Heathrow Airport from May 2018, and between
central London and Heathrow Airport from December 2019.

- In addition, the UK Government has confirmed its support for a rail link between Heathrow Airport and the west
of England on the Great Western Main Line forecast for completion by 2024 and the proposed high-speed rail
link between London and Birmingham (with a connection to Heathrow Airport) that is currently scheduled to be
operational by 2026.

- The London Underground Piccadilly Line has stations serving each of the terminals at Heathrow Airport.

- Heathrow Airport has one of the busiest coach stations in the UK. Long distance coach services operated by
National Express provide fast services from Heathrow Airport to various parts of the UK, including Victoria
Coach Station in Central London. Many of the local bus services in the nearby London suburbs also run to the
airport.

45


-----

**Capital investment at Heathrow Airport**

The capital investment programme at Heathrow Airport of approximately £11 billion since 2006 has transformed
Heathrow Airport’s infrastructure, positioning it strongly to continue its role as one of the leading global hub airports
for the benefit of the whole of the UK in the coming decades.

The extension of Heathrow’s current regulatory period by one year to 31 December 2019, rolling over the current price
control of RPI-1.5 per cent. for the additional year (see “Airport Regulation—Principles of Economic Regulation—Q6
_Extension and H7”) is primarily intended to provide the CAA and other stakeholders sufficient time to understand the_
impact of an expanded Heathrow Airport and develop a coherent business plan for an expanded Heathrow Airport.

Capital expenditure for the Q6 regulatory period from 1 April 2014 to 31 December 2018 is currently forecast to be
£2.9 billion in 2011/2012 prices. The proposed capital expenditure related to the one year extension to Q6 is under
review with the airline community. The capital investment plan is subject to approval of individual projects and the
corresponding business cases. The capital programme is primarily focused on maintenance and compliance related
projects, together with sustaining and improving the passenger experience. The capital plan for the period includes a £1
billion programme of asset management projects and a multi-million project to implement latest generation hold
baggage screening equipment to comply with EU directives. Capital spend in 2017 is forecast to be in the region of
£775 million.

(1) Percentage growth on previous year and compound annual growth rate is based on unrounded passenger and ATM numbers.

Over the period from 2006 to 2016, traffic at Heathrow Airport increased by approximately 12 per cent. to 75.7 million
passengers in 2016, an annual compound rate of 1.2 per cent. Heathrow Airport has generally been operating close to its
limit of 480,000 Air Transport Movements per annum for the last 15 years, operating at 98.6 per cent. of its limit in
2016. As a result, overall passenger growth at the airport is generally dependent on factors such as larger aircraft,
increases in the number of seats available for particular types of aircraft and higher load factors.

In recent years, these factors have all contributed to deliver growth in passenger traffic. For example, the average seats
per passenger aircraft have increased from 197.4 in 2012 to 211.5 in 2016. As a result, passenger traffic growth
averaged 2.0 per cent. per annum between 2012 and 2016, a period during which Heathrow has achieved five
consecutive years of record traffic. Specific drivers of the increase in seats per aircraft have included:

   - the introduction by British Airways of larger aircraft to operate the slots it acquired through the purchase of
bmi in 2012, which particularly underpinned Heathrow’s traffic growth in 2013;

   - the increase in utilisation of the A380 aircraft from around 351 ATMs per month in early 2011 to around 1,520
per month currently; and

   - a programme by British Airways to introduce new generation seating on its short haul fleet that has enabled it
to increase the number of seats on its short haul aircraft fleet, which particularly underpinned Heathrow’s
traffic growth in 2015.

In the five years prior to 2012, prior to the recent period of more robust growth, Heathrow’s traffic declined modestly
particularly reflecting the impact of the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009. Its passenger traffic declined only 1.4
per cent. to 66.9 million in 2008 (from 2007) and 1.5 per cent. to 65.9 million in 2009 (from 2008) and saw a
cumulative reduction in rolling annual traffic from peak to trough in this period of 3.4 per cent. This was amongst the
most resilient performances of major airports in Europe and North America, thought to be influenced by three factors
namely Heathrow Airport operating at full capacity, its high exposure to long haul traffic (the faster growing segment of
the global aviation market) and the countercyclical nature of Transfer traffic.

In 2010, reported traffic declined a further 0.2 per cent. (compared to 2009) due to disruption from a number of
exceptional events including closure of UK and European airspace in April due to ash from an Icelandic volcano. The
impact of these events was estimated at a loss of up to 2.4 million passengers, resulting in underlying traffic growth of
3.4 per cent. in 2010.

Over the last ten years there has also been a shift in traffic at Heathrow Airport towards long haul routes with long haul
traffic increasing 20 per cent. from 32.8 million passengers in 2006 to 39.3 million passengers in 2016. European and
domestic UK traffic was just 5 per cent. higher at the end of this period with its share of Heathrow Airport’s total traffic
declining from 50 per cent. of total traffic in 2006 to 47 per cent. in 2016.

(2015: 39.3 million). British Airways and Iberia are currently the sole airline occupants at Terminal 5. Heathrow has an
agreed joint framework with British Airways for future cooperation.

The second largest airline customer at Heathrow Airport is Virgin Atlantic Airways which operates multi-class flights
to long haul destinations from Heathrow Airport’s Terminal 3.

Lufthansa Group owns Lufthansa, Austrian Airlines, Swiss Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Germanwings and Eurowings
which all operate at Heathrow Airport and traffic from these airlines in 2016 totalled 4.2 million passengers (2015: 4.1
million).

**_Air Service Agreements and Open Skies_**

The rights of airlines to operate to and from Heathrow Airport are subject to bilateral air service agreements between
the UK and other countries (which fall under the umbrella of the 1944 Convention on International Civil Aviation), and
multilateral agreements (such as the Open Skies agreement between the European Community, its 28 Member States
and the United States which came into effect on 30 March 2008, and liberalised air services between the EU Member
States and the United States (the “Open Skies Agreement”)), which permits any airline in the EU to fly to any point in
the US and vice-versa. As a result of these air service agreements, a greater number of airlines have access to Heathrow
Airport.

**OTHER OPERATIONS**

**Cargo and Mail Carriers**

Heathrow Airport handles cargo and mail traffic although this forms a small part of Air Transport Movements. The bulk
of cargo and mail at the airport is carried in the cargo holds of passenger flights rather than by dedicated cargo flights.
There were 2,467 all-cargo Air Transport Movements at Heathrow Airport in 2016 (2015: 2,396) (Source: Heathrow).

Cargo and mail carriers are responsible for handling merchandise and packages at Heathrow Airport, including delivery
to cargo warehouses, customs procedures and clearance, aircraft loading and unloading, sorting and transport to the
final destination.

**ROLE OF GOVERNMENT SERVICES AND AGENCIES IN AIRPORT OPERATIONS**

The UK Government is responsible for a number of essential services at Heathrow Airport, which it discharges through
governmental and non-governmental agencies, notably:

  - Security operations: The UK Government is responsible for setting aviation security regulations, issues
directions to airport operators, airlines and cargo operators and monitors compliance with these directions
through a programme of regular inspections and audits;

  - Public order and policing services: Policing operations at Heathrow Airport are the responsibility of the
Metropolitan Police Authority which is paid to provide these services. These public safety services should be
distinguished from security operations, which are designed to prevent illicit acts that risk endangering the
security of aircraft and passengers; and

  - Border controls: The UK Home Office’s Border Force is responsible for the control of persons and goods.

Air traffic control, including aerodrome navigation services, are provided by NATS, a privately held entity which is
responsible for the arrival and departure of aircraft to and from the aircraft parking areas at Heathrow Airport. NATS
also works closely with Heathrow and airlines in determining the declaration of scheduling capacity.

**SUPPLIERS**
The Heathrow Airport Holdings Group works with numerous external suppliers for the delivery of services relating to
the day-to-day operation of the airport, as well as for the construction of capital projects.

**Utilities**

The electrical power distribution infrastructure at Heathrow Airport is owned, managed, maintained and developed by
UK Power Networks Services Limited under a contract that expires in 2083. Arrangements are in place with E.ON for
the supply of electricity and gas, with Affinity Water for the supply of water and with Thames Water for sewerage and
trade effluent services.

48


-----

**IT**
A majority of IT services for Heathrow Airport are currently outsourced to be managed by Capgemini UK plc under a
contract that commenced in 2011. The Group is currently planning the future of IT services for Heathrow Airport. SITA
Networking UK Limited was appointed in January 2017 to provide certain network and telecommunications services.

**Baggage**

Baggage system operation and maintenance services for Heathrow Airport are provided by Babcock Airports Limited
under a framework contract that commenced in 2013 for an initial term of 5 years which may be extended by a further 2
years.

**Other services**

There are a large number of services required for the operation of Heathrow Airport which are arranged on a separate
basis with external suppliers, including security screening, ground handling, terminal cleaning and passenger
transportation services.

**COMPETITION**
Heathrow Airport competes for Transfer traffic with the other major European hub airports such as Paris Charles de
Gaulle, Amsterdam Schiphol, Frankfurt and Madrid Barajas. The airport also faces increasing competition for Transfer
traffic from hub airports in the Middle East, such as Dubai, Istanbul and Doha.

To a more limited extent, there is some competition from London Gatwick Airport, London Stansted Airport, London
Luton Airport, London Southend Airport and London City Airport in the air travel market in the South East of England
and other forms of travel (including the Eurostar high-speed train service connecting London with Paris, Brussels and a
variety of other European cities).

**EXPANSION OF HEATHROW AIRPORT**
On 25 October 2016, the UK Government announced its decision to support the expansion of Heathrow Airport. The
UK Government’s decision follows the clear and unanimous recommendation of the Airports Commission on 1 July
2015, following nearly three years of consultation, evidence gathering and analysis. While the detailed design of an
expanded Heathrow Airport is subject to engagement and public consultation through the planning and consenting
process with Heathrow Airport’s airline and local community, the proposed expansion of Heathrow Airport is expected
to include the construction of a new runway north west of Heathrow Airport (the “North West Runway”), related
enabling infrastructure and new taxiway systems, an additional main terminal and Satellite building, automated baggage
facilities and passenger track transit for ease of movement around Heathrow Airport (together the “North West
**Runway Scheme”). The North West Runway Scheme is expected to involve a significant programme of acquisition of**
residential and commercial property in the area of land adjacent to the existing perimeter of Heathrow Airport, to be
acquired to develop much of the expected additional infrastructure and facilities required as part of the North West
Runway Scheme. Expansion of Heathrow Airport is expected to enable at least an additional 260,000 ATMs per year to
operate at Heathrow Airport, taking total ATMs up to 740,000 per year. This could in turn result in the total passenger
numbers increasing to approximately 130 million per year over time.

The UK Government has made it clear that the expansion of Heathrow Airport will only be allowed to proceed on the
basis of Heathrow offering a “world class package of compensation and mitigation worth up to £2.6 billion, including
community support, insulation, and respite from noise” to balance expansion.

Heathrow is committed to implementing various measures including property compensation and environmental
mitigation proposals that Heathrow had already outlined in its proposals during the Airports Commission process and
thereafter, including on 11 May 2016 when Heathrow announced it will meet and, in most cases, exceed the conditions
set out in the Airports Commission’s recommendation for the expansion of Heathrow Airport.

On 29 September 2016, Heathrow announced plans, which are subject to consultation and express policy support to
connect UK regions to growth quicker, including proposals for up to 25,000 more ATMs per year from 2021 on
Heathrow Airport’s existing runways, while the North West Runway is being built. It is expected that this early release
of capacity will require early delivery of noise mitigation measures.

**National Policy Statement and Development Consent Order process**

The Planning Act 2008 (the “Planning Act”) provides for the Secretary of State to designate a national policy statement
to set out national policy in relation to one or more types of development, that meet a certain threshold and are therefore
considered ‘nationally significant’, such as major airport development. As it meets the thresholds set out in the Planning
Act, the expansion of Heathrow Airport is one of these ‘nationally significant infrastructure projects’ (“NSIP”) which
can benefit from policy support in the form of a national policy statement. In general, a national policy statement
provides the national policy framework (that will typically include social, economic, and environmental matters) for

49


-----

certain types of projects against which an application for development consent to construct and operate the project will
be evaluated including strict policy tests that any future DCO (as defined below) application will need to comply with.

In February 2017, the UK Government published its draft Airports National Policy Statement (the “NPS”) outlining its
policy for Heathrow Airport’s expansion. The publication started a 16-week public consultation on the draft NPS that is
expected to conclude on 25 May 2017. A number of key policy tests and requirements are being consulted on which, as
outlined above, are largely reflected in Heathrow’s plans, including:

- the provision of a community compensation fund for local communities impacted by the expansion of Heathrow
Airport;

- the acquisition of residential properties affected by the North West Runway Scheme at a 25 per cent. premium
above market value;

- the implementation of measures to mitigate noise, including a six and a half hour ban on scheduled night flights
(currently five hours) with the exact timing of the ban to be determined through consultation;

- the provision of extensive insulation to properties around Heathrow Airport suffering new or increased noise
impacts within specified levels;

- setting specific public and staff transport mode share targets to curb impacts on traffic congestion and air quality;
and

- demonstrating the North West Runway Scheme can be delivered in compliance with legal requirements on air
quality.

Parliamentary scrutiny of the draft NPS, via the Transport Select Committee, has run in parallel and is expected to run
subsequent to the public consultation. A general election to be held in the UK in June 2017 means that parliamentary
scrutiny is likely to recommence in late summer/early autumn of 2017, which may delay the submission of a final
version of the NPS for a vote in the UK Parliament which had originally been expected to take place during the winter
of 2017/2018. Assuming the required vote in favour, the Secretary of State for Transport is expected to then ‘designate’
the NPS. The designation of the final NPS can be subject to judicial review. The final NPS is expected to set planning
tests and standards that any DCO application must meet. In general, a designated NPS provides the national policy
framework for certain types of projects against which a planning and development decision can be made. It is expected
to incorporate social, economic and environmental policies.

Following designation of the NPS, under the Planning Act, any development defined as a NSIP (such as the expansion
of Heathrow Airport, an “airport-related development”) will require consent in the form of a DCO.

Heathrow, as a promoter of an NSIP which is covered by the Planning Act, will therefore need to apply for the grant of
a DCO to the Secretary of State for Transport. The final NPS is expected to set planning tests and standards that any
DCO application must meet. This process also requires Heathrow to follow a detailed pre-application procedure
involving extensive publicity and consultation exercises. A DCO application is submitted via the National Infrastructure
Directorate of the Planning Inspectorate (the “NID”) who process the application on behalf of the Secretary of for
Transport. The Secretary of State for Transport will appoint an examining authority to examine publicly the application
and make a recommendation to the Secretary of State, who will then make a final decision on whether to grant the
DCO. The decision to grant a DCO can be subject to judicial review. The grant of a DCO combines a grant of planning
permission along with other separate consents required to construct and operate a NSIP, such as the right of a scheme
promoter to compulsorily acquire property within the geographic area required to implement a scheme. The DCO will
not include consent to make the necessary changes to the airspace and flight paths serving Heathrow Airport, which is
authorised via a separate airspace change process. The final application for airspace change consent is expected to be
submitted after the DCO has been granted.

Heathrow is already working actively to develop its DCO application including preparing for an initial public
consultation later in 2017 on its plans for the expansion of Heathrow Airport. As part of its DCO application, as noted
above, Heathrow currently plans to consult on its current plans, including the implementation of measures to mitigate
noise, including a proposed six and a half hour ban on scheduled night flights (currently five hours) with the exact
timing of the ban to be determined through consultation.

In parallel with the NPS and DCO processes, significant activity is currently underway on other key aspects of
expansion. These include changes to aerospace management, and airline engagement. Airline engagement is
particularly focused on affordability and the scope to meet the common aspiration to maintain Heathrow Airport’s
charges at the lowest possible level, which is also consistent with the UK Government’s proposals when it announced
support for Heathrow expansion in October 2016.

In addition, there have been a number of, and there are expected to be further, regulatory developments related to the
expansion of Heathrow Airport. The CAA has categorised costs incurred or to be incurred by Heathrow in relation to
potential future expansion into three categories:

  - Category A, these costs incurred prior to a decision by the UK Government to support expansion, these costs
have been incurred by Heathrow before 25 October 2016;

  - Category B, costs incurred in connection with the DCO process; and

  - Category C, pre-construction and construction costs in relation to expansion typically incurred following the
grant of a DCO.

In relation to Category A costs, the CAA has determined that the recovery of most of these costs through airport charges
will not be permitted.

In July 2016, the CAA commenced consultation on the regulatory treatment of Category B costs. Heathrow currently
expects that approximately £250-300 million Category B costs will be incurred primarily between 2017 and 2020. In
December 2016 the CAA modified Heathrow’s economic licence to allow the annual recovery of up to £10 million of
Category B costs through airport charges.

The CAA’s policy statement on the treatment of Category B costs above £10m was published in February 2017 and
included mechanisms that allow:

(i) costs in excess of £10 million per annum to be added to the RAB;

(ii) the regulatory cost of capital to accrue on the costs once added to the RAB;

(iii) recovery of the costs following receipt of the DCO; and

(iv) risk sharing under which either 105% or 85% of costs added to the RAB will be recovered if the DCO
is granted or not granted, respectively.

In addition, the CAA will perform the usual efficiency test to allow for the recovery of any Category B costs and
indicated that it would reconsider its policy position on Category B costs if they significantly exceed £265 million. See
‘Airport Regulation – Airport Regulation Generally – Regulatory Framework’.

In January 2017, the CAA initiated consultation on its key priorities and timetable for the development of the regulatory
framework for the expansion of Heathrow Airport and in particular, the regulatory treatment of Category C costs and
financing of the construction programme. The CAA revealed four key priorities to be considered when developing the
regulatory framework:

(i) the North West Runway Scheme must be designed to promote the interests of consumers by engaging with
airlines in a transparent and effective manner;

(ii) cost estimates must be robust and their regulatory treatment must incentivise timely and efficient delivery
of the project,

(iii) Heathrow must develop proposals for efficient financing while the regulatory framework needs to be
consistent with efficient financing, affordability and financeability; and

(iv) affordability and financeability principles must apply to both existing operations and new runway and
capacity expansion.

Responses to this CAA consultation were due by 14 March 2017. The CAA published updated guidance on its business
plan expectations and outcomes for H7 in April 2017. A further consultation on the regulatory framework is expected at
the end of June 2017.

Regarding Heathrow’s current regulatory period (Q6) and the next regulatory period (H7), _please see ‘Airport_
_Regulation – Heathrow Price Regulation – Q6 Extension and H7’._

**ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION AND MANAGEMENT**

**Environmental regulation**

Heathrow is subject to or influenced by various regulation and legislation relating to environmental matters, with
provisions related to aircraft noise, air quality and carbon emissions being particularly relevant.

51


-----

**_Aircraft noise regulation_**

Aircraft noise in and around UK airports is subject to European, UK and local regulation. The EU is assuming
increasing responsibility for the regulation of aircraft noise standards, with EU member states obliged to comply with
the requirements of EU directives and incorporate them into national legislation. The UK government has a key role in
setting and developing the policy framework for aircraft noise control, particularly at designated UK airports. A range
of noise controls relating to aircraft operations are set out in statutory notices and published in the UK Aeronautical
Information Package and elsewhere as appropriate. These controls cover aspects such as continuous descent approach,
noise abatement procedures and night flight restrictions.

Additional noise-related controls are a feature of the local planning system that often introduces planning obligations in
section 106 agreements between airport operators and planning authorities. At Heathrow Airport there are various
conditions to the planning permissions for Terminals 4 and 5 that restrict aircraft operations at different times of day
relative to the location of the activity on the airfield.

**_Air quality and carbon emissions regulation_**

Heathrow is subject to or influenced by various regulations and legislation designed to improve air quality and reduce
carbon emissions. These include global agreements binding the UK to reduce its carbon emissions, EU law requiring
local air quality (whether from airport or other activities) to achieve minimum standards and UK regulations governing
certain activities and operations, specifically the operation of Heathrow’s boiler installations.

In December 2015, the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (“Defra”) published a revised national air
quality action plan which outlines necessary steps to bring the UK into compliance with EU law in the shortest time
possible. Local air quality monitoring stations show that the immediate vicinity of Heathrow is already compliant with
the nitrogen dioxide limit values. Defra’s current plan demonstrates that areas in the vicinity of the airport (within 2
kilometres) will be compliant by 2020, ahead of the overall Greater London area which is not expected to be compliant
until 2025. Following the most recent court judgement in the Client Earth air quality case against the UK Government,
Defra launched a consultation on a revised Air Quality Plan in May 2017 and expects to publish the results of the
consultation by the end of July 2017.

Heathrow is also subject to regulation and taxation of energy- related CO2 emissions due to the size of combustion plant
on site. The EU Emissions Trading System (“EU ETS”) defines an annually reducing free allowance for emissions
from fossil fuel combustion on site, resulting in an increasing requirement to either reduce emissions or purchase
additional allowances. Further, the Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme, requires Heathrow to
pay the UK government for each tonne of carbon dioxide emitted from fixed asset energy use not already covered by
EU ETS. In addition, the Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme (ESOS) requires all large businesses in the UK not
certified to ISO 50001 to undertake mandatory assessments looking at energy use and energy efficiency opportunities at
least once every four years.

**Environmental management**

**Sustainability and environmental management**

Heathrow is committed to managing Heathrow Airport in a responsible and sustainable manner seeking to balance the
positive economic and social contribution of Heathrow Airport with its responsibility to minimise its environmental
impact.

During the course of 2016 Heathrow built on its Responsible Heathrow 2020 programme to develop a new strategy that
delivers on the Group’s ambition to take a clear leadership role on sustainability, including a more proactive approach
to addressing sustainability across environmental, social and economic aspects by working with the Group’s operational
partners to make the community around Heathrow Airport one of the best places to live.

In February 2017, Heathrow launched “Heathrow 2.0”, a new sustainability leadership strategy which aspires to make
Heathrow Airport a centre of excellence for the aviation industy and contains ambitious goals to reduce the airport’s
and the industry’s environmental impacts while maximising economic opportunities throughout the UK.

Heathrow 2.0 builds on all of Heathrow’s previous sustainability initiatives and:

   - puts forward targets to deliver a sustainable future for aviation;

   - includes an aspiration to make growth from the new North West Runway at Heathrow Airport carbon neutral,
and the use of 100 per cent. renewable electricity at Heathrow Airport from 2017 in a major step toward
creating a zero-carbon airport;

52


-----

   - proposes establishing an airside ultra-low emission zone by 2025, to improve quality of life through cleaner
air;

   - outlines new initiatives for the benefit of local communities – including a voluntary Quiet Night Charter
seeking to at least halve by 2022 the number of flights on non-disrupted days leaving late after 11:30pm;

   - launches a “Fly Quiet and Clean” league table, which will publicly rank airlines according to their noise and
emissions; and

   - aims to deliver a better working place for colleagues by creating 10,000 apprenticeships by 2030 with the
North West Runway, and publishing a roadmap in 2017 setting out how to transition Heathrow’s supply
chain employees working at Heathrow Airport to be paid the London Living Wage.

Heathrow’s sustainability and environmental performance is monitored by the Sustainability and Operational Risk
Committee, a sub-committee of the Heathrow Airport Holdings board, that has as one of its key responsibilities the
regular review of Heathrow’s performance and conduct in relation to sustainability and environmental matters.

With approximately 400 companies employing in the region of 76,000 people at Heathrow Airport, and over 200,000
passengers travelling on nearly 1,300 flights every day, the challenges associated with operating Heathrow Airport
responsibly are complex. Given this environment, Heathrow seeks not only to improve its own environmental
performance but to influence the whole Heathrow community. To this end Heathrow has set up a number of
partnerships such as the Heathrow Sustainability Partnership, the Clean Vehicles Partnership and the Responsible
Gateway Forum to support collaborative working between businesses operating at Heathrow Airport and to help
Heathrow achieve its commitments to doing business responsibly.

**_Aircraft noise management_**

Heathrow’s approach to aircraft noise management is set out in its Environmental Noise Directive Noise Action Plan
2013-2018 (“ENDNAP”). This focuses on analysing and implementing various measures to reduce noise impacts
through reduction at source (quieter aircraft), land-use planning and management, noise abatement operational
procedures and operating restrictions as well as engaging and collaborating with the community and other key
stakeholders in delivery of noise reduction initiatives.

In 2014, Heathrow established the Heathrow Noise Forum, now called the Heathrow Strategic Noise Advisory Group,
that brings together representatives from the Department for Transport, the CAA, National Air Traffic Control, IATA,
British Airways, noise pressure group HACAN, local authorities and Heathrow and seeks to foster collaboration in
noise management at the airport. In 2015, Heathrow also established the Heathrow Community Noise Forum (HCNF)
to keep residents and local stakeholders informed on areas such as airspace planning, future trials and consultations, and
to develop the understanding of airspace and operational issues.

Heathrow launched a second Blueprint for noise reduction in August 2016 which challenges Heathrow and its partners
to collaborate to be quieter, sooner. The blueprint builds on the actions set out in the ENDNAP and sets out measures to
reduce noise including a new charging structure to encourage the quietest aircraft, retrofitting A320 aircraft to make
them quieter, continuous descent approach, potential use of steeper descents on arrivals and delaying the lowering of
landing gear. It also includes proposals for a new voluntary Quiet Night Charter and ventilation fit-outs at local schools.
With the introduction of fifty new noise monitors, a new noise reporting format has been developed by the HCNF.
Finally, Heathrow has launched a world-first web-based tool, xPlane, that allows individuals to conduct a “gate
analysis” over their homes.

**_Sustainability, improving air quality and reducing carbon emissions_**

In February 2017, Heathrow launched “Heathrow 2.0”, a plan for sustainable growth which builds on Heathrow’s
previous sustainability initiatives (detailed above).

In 2015 Heathrow published an updated Energy Strategy that supports its long-term commitment to reduce carbon
dioxide emissions from energy used in operating fixed infrastructure by 34 per cent. from 1990 levels by 2020.
Advances in technology, operations and alternative fuels have helped Heathrow make a 27 per cent. saving on carbon
emissions since 1990 to date, despite major infrastructure developments including the opening of Terminal 5 and
Terminal 2 over this period. Heathrow has recently achieved ISO 50001 accreditation for its energy management
system. A focus and investment in energy efficiency has helped Heathrow to cut electricity consumption by 70GWh in
the last four years as part of an on-going programme of measures including LED lighting installation, improved controls
and more efficient assets. Energy efficiency standards for new buildings and infrastructure have been strengthened.
Heathrow has also invested in on-site renewable energy generation, an example of this includes the biomass fuelled
Combined Heat and Power Plant that forms part of the new Energy Centre and supplies the new Terminal 2. As part of
Heathrow 2.0, Heathrow continues to pursue these objectives by aiming to operate a zero carbon airport infrastructure
(such as, buildings and other fixed assets) by 2050 with clear interim targets and to incentivise lower carbon flights to
use expanded capacity by developing proposals for ‘green slots’ on the third runway.

53


-----

In April 2016, Heathrow launched its second blueprint for reducing emissions to help play its part in improving air
quality around Heathrow Airport (as well as reducing carbon emissions). This builds on Heathrow’s 2011-2020 Air
Quality Strategy and Action Plan and includes actions to further reduce emissions from aircraft at the gate and
encouraging airlines to phase out their older aircraft. It also aims to improve taxiing efficiency, both through upgrading
Heathrow Airport’s taxiway system and by encouraging airlines to reduce the number of engines running during
taxiing. Heathrow is also leading the way in the airport community by cutting emissions on its airside vehicle fleet and
pooling ground support equipment. Around the airport, Heathrow is working to incentivise low-emission vehicles and
provide more electric vehicle charging points. Heathrow is also working with partners to champion a joint approach to
reducing emissions from road traffic in the Heathrow area and is working with Transport for London and other
stakeholders to formulate a regional strategy for air quality.

In addition, for many years Heathrow has actively encouraged use of more sustainable transport by passengers and
people working at Heathrow Airport. This is reflected in Heathrow operating the world’s largest single-site car sharing
scheme, the UK’s first publicly accessible hydrogen refuelling site and an unrivalled public transport system linking
passengers to surrounding communities and central London (including free travel in the vicinity of Heathrow Airport
paid for by Heathrow). These projects were recognised and commended in June 2015 when Heathrow was awarded the
Eco-Innovation Award by ACI Europe. Further significant developments in alternatives for surface access to Heathrow
are expected in the coming years particularly with the expected commencement of Crossrail services between
Paddington and Heathrow Airport from May 2018, and between central London and Heathrow Airport from December
2019. For more information, see _“Business – Heathrow Airport’s Infrastructure, Facilities and Access – Access to_
_Heathrow Airport”. Heathrow 2.0 expands these activities to the supply chain and seeks to achieve Level 3 Carbon_
Trust Supply Chain Accreditation by 2020 by setting quantitative reduction targets for the carbon impact from
Heathrow’s supply chain. Heathrow also aims to provide support on energy efficiency to its first tier strategic suppliers
by 2020 and increase the percentage of strategic suppliers that have undertaken an assessment of climate change
vulnerability and pursued actions to adapt accordingly. See “Risk Factors – Regulatory Risks – The Group faces costs
_related to environmental, health and safety and planning considerations”._

**RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**
Heathrow has entered and may from time to time in the future enter into transactions with certain affiliates of Heathrow
Airport Holdings and its shareholders. All such contracts are and will be negotiated on an arm’s-length basis.

**SHARED SERVICES**
Pursuant to a Shared Services Agreement, LHR Airports provides or procures third parties to provide certain central
support services to the Group to assist with the running and management of Heathrow Airport and Heathrow Express.

**Services provided by LHR Airports, or Heathrow as a sub-contractor for LHR Airports**

The services provided by LHR Airports include management services (such as senior management and strategic
direction), IT, health and safety, security, research, airport planning and marketing, finance, human resources, property
management, regulatory services, corporate and public affairs and legal support. From 1 January 2013, following the
divestment of Gatwick Airport and in light of the (at that time) expected divestment of Stansted Airport and to reflect
more accurately the current organisation and economic reality, LHR Airports sub-contracted the majority of these
services to Heathrow. Heathrow, as a sub-contractor for LHR Airports, provides certain central support services for
Heathrow Express. Additionally, pursuant to a separate agreement, LHR Airports has sub-contracted certain of the cash
management and accounting services to LHR Business Support Centre Limited.

All of the staff working for Heathrow are employed and provided by LHR Airports. Heathrow Express employs most of
its own staff directly (with some staff being provided by LHR Airports).

The terms on which services and staff are provided to the Group are set out in the Shared Services Agreement. Central
support services are provided by Heathrow to Heathrow Express pursuant to a separate agreement between Heathrow
and Heathrow Express.

**Fees payable to LHR Airports**

Heathrow pays a fee to LHR Airports which comprises:

(a) the cost to LHR Airports of providing the services; and

(b) in respect of centralised airport services, administrative and business support services and corporate services, a
margin of 7.5 per cent.

The majority of costs for employees provided under the Shared Services Agreement are included in the charges for
airport services and capital project services, to which the margin does not apply. The margin payable to LHR Airports
in relation to services to the Group was £0.5 million in the 12 months ended 31 December 2016 (2015: £1.1 million).

54


-----

**Termination of Shared Services Agreement**

Subject to the prior written consent of the Borrower Security Trustee, the Operating Companies have the right to
terminate the Shared Services Agreement in the case of a breach by LHR Airports with a material adverse effect not
remedied within 30 days, certain insolvency related events in relation to LHR Airports or if it becomes illegal for either
LHR Airports or the Obligors to perform their obligations under the Shared Services Agreement.

LHR Airports may terminate the Shared Services Agreement only where:

(a) another suitable and properly resourced member of the Heathrow Airport Holdings Group (excluding any
members of the Group) is appointed to act as replacement Shared Services Provider on substantially the same
terms;

(b) a replacement Shared Services Provider is appointed with the consent of and approved by the Borrower
Security Trustee and, unless otherwise agreed as an Extraordinary Voting Matter, a Ratings Confirmation is
provided; or

(c) the Operating Companies fail to pay any amounts of £50,000 or more to LHR Airports under the Shared
Services Agreement, subject to a 30 Business Day grace period.

The Shared Services Agreement will terminate in respect of an Operating Company which ceases to be controlled by
LHR Airports. Unless otherwise agreed, termination will take effect 6 months from the date that the Operating
Company ceases to be controlled by LHR Airports.

LHR Airports is entitled to pass pensions costs on to the Group. These relate principally to LHR Airports’ obligation to
fund the Heathrow Airport Holdings Group defined benefit pension scheme and are calculated on a basis linked to
pensionable payroll in respect of those employees that LHR Airports makes available to the Operating Companies
under the Shared Services Agreement. In certain circumstances, the obligation of the Operating Companies to meet
pension costs will survive termination of the agreement.

In the event of termination of the Shared Services Agreement, LHR Airports is required to use its reasonable
endeavours to facilitate the transfer of the terminated services to the Operating Companies (or to any replacement
servicer appointed by the Operating Companies) with a view to ensuring an orderly and efficient transfer with minimal
disruption to the ongoing business of the Operating Companies. The employment of relevant airport level staff is
expected to pass to the relevant Operating Company or to a replacement service provider.

**Potential Conflicts of Interest**

As a result of the fact that Heathrow and Heathrow Express have entered into the Shared Services Agreement, there
may be potential conflicts of interest for Ross Baker, Stuart Birrell, Normand Boivin, Javier Echave, Emma Gilthorpe,
John Holland-Kaye, Carol Hui, Andrew Macmillan and Paula Stannett who are directors of LHR Airports (which is the
provider of the shared services) and Heathrow (which receives the shared services) and, in the case of Ross Baker and
Normand Boivin, Heathrow Express. Potential conflicts of interest may arise where the same individuals are directors
of both the entity providing the shared services and the entities receiving the shared services because they have, among
other obligations, a duty to promote the success of the companies of which they are directors. A potential conflict may
arise for the individuals listed above if what is in the best interest of one company is not necessarily in the best interest
of the other.

For a description of certain risks associated with the Shared Services Agreement, see “Risk Factors – Commercial Risks
_– The Group is dependent on LHR Airports as Shared Services Provider to operate its businesses”._

**INSURANCE**
LHR Airports provides insurance and claims handling services to the Operating Companies. LHR Airports arranges
both annual and multi-year insurance programmes on a group-wide basis for the Heathrow Airport Holdings Group.
Heathrow Express has separate public liability insurance cover and Heathrow, through LHR Airports, has separate
policies to protect against specific risks.

The Heathrow Airport Holdings Group insurance programmes, which are required under the CTA, include the
following insurance cover:

- **_property damage and business interruption insurance and construction all-risks insurance which covers all_**
risks (including terrorism) of sudden accidental direct physical loss or destruction of, or damage to, insured
property and resultant loss of revenue and/or increased costs of maintaining normal business activities. There
is also a separate policy covering specified tenanted properties, which provides cover on the basis of individual
property sums insured;

55


-----

- **_general liability insurance, including aviation liability, aviation war/terrorism, public/product liability; public_**
liability with respect to the Heathrow Express rail service; and construction third-party liability;

- **_third-party financial loss and professional indemnity insurance; and_**

- **_employers’ liability insurance._**

Insurance cover for the Group is provided by a combination of insurance market entities and captive insurance
companies owned by or affiliated with LHR Airports or its ultimate shareholders.

The financing agreements (within the CTA) require the Obligors to effect and maintain insurance policies in relation to
liabilities, undertakings and assets in accordance with good industry insurance practice. Details of these insurance
policies are provided annually to an insurance adviser acting on behalf of certain secured creditors.

Some insurance cover for the Group is provided by Heathrow Airport Holdings’ own captive insurance company, LHR
Insurance Services Ltd (the “Captive”). The Captive enables the Heathrow Airport Holdings Group to access
reinsurance markets (including Pool Re for property terrorism risks), to leverage the Heathrow Airport Holdings
Group’s combined position on the conventional insurance market and to offer funding options for the Group’s selfinsured retention. The Captive underwrites some group-wide risks and also funds some of the Heathrow Airport
Holdings Group’s self-insured retention.

For more information on insurance, see “Risk Factors – Commercial Risks – The Group’s insurance coverage might not
_be adequate or available in all circumstances”._

**PENSIONS**
The Heathrow Airport Holdings Group operates a number of pension schemes for its employees. The main schemes,
which are sponsored by LHR Airports, the employing company within the Heathrow Airport Holdings Group, comprise
a defined benefit pension scheme that closed to employees joining LHR Airports after 15 June 2008 (the “Pension
**Scheme”) and a defined contribution pension scheme that employees joining LHR Airports since 16 June 2008 are**
eligible to join. There are also separate defined contribution pension schemes for employees of Heathrow Express and
LHR Business Support Centre Limited (the “BSC”).

Under the terms of the Shared Services Agreement, Heathrow makes monthly cash payments into the Pension Scheme
determined by the latest agreement made with the trustees of the Pension Scheme. Employer contributions into the
defined contribution pension scheme are determined as a percentage of the aggregate basic salary, plus skills based pay,
for all relevant scheme members. Under the terms of the Shared Services Agreement, Heathrow is also liable to fund
any deficit in the Pension Scheme. The Pension Scheme also has a right to receive up to £284 million of the proceeds of
an enforcement of the security granted by the Obligors, which right ranks pari passu with senior (Class A) debt.

The Pension Scheme is administered by a corporate trustee, the BAA Pension Trust Company Limited. The directors of
the corporate trustee comprise three elected employee representatives, one pensioner representative and four LHR
Airports nominated trustees. In addition, the scheme rules require the appointment of an independent trustee (currently
fulfilled by Law Debenture Trust Company). As at 31 December 2016, the Pension Scheme had 3,301 current ‘active’
members, 8,930 pensioners (including pensions paid to surviving partners and dependents) and 5,106 deferred
pensioners.

The most recent actuarial valuation of the Pension Scheme, undertaken by its trustee as at 30 September 2015, indicated
a scheme deficit of £228 million calculated using the trustees’ actuarial assumptions. As part of the valuation process,
LHR Airports and the Pension Scheme’s trustees agreed that the annual deficit recovery payment into the Pension
Scheme would decrease from £27 million to £23 million and apply until 2022. In addition, in respect of future accrual
of benefits, LHR Airports would contribute approximately 23 per cent. of basic salary and shift pay, which is estimated
to be £26 million for 2017.

The reduction in deficit recovery and future accrual cash payments arose from the changes introduced with effect from
1 October 2015, following consultation with affected Pension Scheme members required by applicable regulation.

The changes introduced, impacting only active members of the Pension Scheme, were:

- a reduction in future benefit accrual rate from 1/54th to 1/60th of pensionable pay;

- the introduction of an annual cap of 2 per cent. on future increases in pensionable pay; and

- a cap of 2.5 per cent. on annual increases to pension payments in retirement.

56


-----

Recognition of these changes for accounting purposes was immediately reflected in the Group s financial statements in
accordance with IAS19. In particular, there was a one-off (non-cash) credit of £236 million in 2015 as a result of the
introduction of the annual cap of 2 per cent. on future increases in pensionable pay.

At 31 December 2016 the Pension Scheme had a deficit of £79 million compared to a £104 million surplus at 31
December 2015, both as measured under IAS19. The £183 million change is due to net actuarial losses of £219 million,
partly offset by contributions in excess of current service cost of £34 million, including £25 million for agreed deficit
repair contributions.

The cost to the Heathrow Airport Holdings Group of contributions to defined contribution pension schemes in 2016 was
approximately £10 million (2015: £8 million).

For additional information, see “Risk Factors – Commercial Risks – Heathrow and Heathrow Express (together, the
_“Operating Companies” and each an “Operating Company”) could be subject to periodic increase in pension cash_
_contributions in the future”._

**AIRPORT REGULATION**

**AIRPORT REGULATION GENERALLY**

**Regulatory Framework**

Heathrow is subject to economic regulation by the Civil Aviation Authority (“CAA”). The CAA is the independent
aviation regulator in the UK, responsible for economic regulation, airspace policy, safety and consumer protection.

As the economic regulator for UK airports, the CAA assesses the market power of airports and if an airport passes the
market power test(s) set out in the Civil Aviation Act 2012 (the **“Civil Aviation Act”), the airport is regulated by**
means of a licence. Heathrow has been determined, by the CAA, to hold significant market power and operates under a
licence granted by the CAA in February 2014. The licence includes a price cap on Heathrow’s airport charges.

The CAA sets the maximum level of airport charges for Heathrow, generally for five-year periods, known as
Quinquennia. Heathrow’s current regulatory period was initially for four years and nine months from 1 April 2014 to 31
December 2018 in order to align Heathrow’s financial and regulatory years. A summary of the regulatory settlement for
the current regulatory period is set out in _“Heathrow Price Regulation—Key Elements of the CAA’s Q6 Decision”_
below. In December 2016, the CAA published modifications to Heathrow’s licence (which took effect from 1 February
2017) extending Heathrow’s current regulatory period by one year so that it will end on 31 December 2019, rolling over
the current price control of RPI-1.5 per cent. for the additional year.

Heathrow is regulated by means of a price control mechanism known as RPI +/- X, which incorporates an allowed
return on the Regulatory Asset Base (referred to as the “RAB”). This is consistent with the economic regulation of other
UK regulated industries (such as telecoms and the energy and water sectors). This form of economic regulation is also
sometimes referred to as incentive regulation, in that Heathrow has an incentive to outperform the price control by
means of attracting more passengers, reducing operating costs or delivering higher commercial revenues than forecast.
If the opposite is the case, then Heathrow has to absorb the cost. There is not a retrospective adjustment for shortfalls in
income or additional costs (except, principally, where Heathrow incurs additional security costs, above an established
threshold, when implementing new security directives imposed by the EU or the UK Government).

**The CAA and its Statutory Powers and Objectives**

## The CAA in its role as economic regulator has a single primary duty to further the interests of users of air transport
services regarding the range, availability, continuity, cost and quality of airport operation services (where appropriate,
by promoting competition in the provision of airport operation services). There are also supplementary duties to which
the CAA must have regard in fulfilling its primary duty:

  - the need to secure that each holder of a licence is able to finance its provision of airport operation services in
the area for which the licence is granted;

  - the need to secure that all reasonable demands for airport operation services are met;

  - the need to promote economy and efficiency on the part of each holder of a licence in its provision of airport
operation services at the airport to which the licence relates;

  - the need to secure that each holder of a licence is able to take reasonable measures to reduce, control or
mitigate the adverse environmental effects of the airport to which the licence relates, facilities used or intended
to be used in connection with that airport (“associated facilities”) and aircraft using that airport;

  - any guidance issued to the CAA by the Secretary of State for Transport;

  - any international obligation of the UK notified to the CAA by the Secretary of State for Transport; and

  - the principles that regulatory activities should be carried out in a way which is transparent, accountable,
proportionate and consistent, and that regulatory activities should be targeted only at cases in which action is
needed.

In its duties, the CAA also must take account of the UK’s international obligations which provide, among other things,
that airport charges for non-national aircraft are not higher than those paid by national aircraft engaged in similar
operations.

58


-----

The European Directive 2009/12/EC on airport charges was implemented into UK law by the Airport Charges
Regulations 2011 which entered into force on 10 November 2011. They establish a common framework for the
provision of information by airports to airport users and airport users to airports, airports consulting their airline
customers about airport charges, service level agreements and major infrastructure projects, and the setting of charges
and the allocation of spare capacity. The CAA is the nominated “independent supervisory agency” under the Airport
Charges Regulations 2011 and, following a consultation, in October 2015 published its guidance on the application of
the CAA’s powers under the Airport Charges Regulations 2011.

**PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMIC REGULATION**

The Civil Aviation Act prohibits an operator of a dominant airport area from charging for airport operation services,
unless it has a licence granted by the CAA. An airport area is dominant if the CAA determines (and publishes) that the
Market Power Test (“MPT”) in the Civil Aviation Act is met by the relevant airport operator. The MPT has three parts:

  - whether the relevant operator has, or is likely to acquire, substantial market power in a market, either alone or
taken with such other persons as the CAA considers appropriate;

  - whether competition law does not provide sufficient protection against the risk that the relevant operator may
engage in conduct that amounts to an abuse of that substantial market power; and

  - for users of air transport services, the benefits of regulating the relevant operator by means of a licence are
likely to outweigh the adverse effects.

In January 2014, the CAA confirmed that the MPT was met in relation to the core area of Heathrow Airport and that
Heathrow’s significant market power is likely to endure for the Q6 period.

**The Price Cap**

The price cap for Heathrow is based on a Regulatory Asset Base (“RAB”) methodology using a “single till” building
block approach. The single till takes into account revenue and costs from both aeronautical and non-aeronautical
activities when setting the price caps for a Quinquennium.

In setting the price cap, the CAA determines the regulated revenue requirement. This is calculated as the sum of
forecast operating expenditure less other revenue plus the required return (using the cost of capital determined by the
CAA) on the forecast RAB (taking into account forecast capital expenditure), plus regulatory depreciation and plus or
minus any profiling adjustment. The profiling adjustment is a mechanism used to smooth charges that might otherwise
occur as a result of major investments. The resulting regulated revenue requirement effectively amounts to the total
income from airport charges.

This methodology for deriving the regulated revenue requirement can be represented by the simplified diagram below:

**Regulatory Building Blocks**

The regulated revenue requirement is divided by forecast passenger numbers which, subject to a price profiling
adjustment to smooth charges across the regulatory period, establishes the price cap expressed as a maximum allowable
yield per passenger.

Since the start of the current regulatory period, the maximum allowable yield changes from 1 January each year by RPI
+/- X per cent. based on RPI from the previous April.

In setting the price cap the CAA will take its own view of the scope for future efficiency savings, the appropriate level
of capital expenditure and the rate of growth in demand for airport services.

59


-----

While the price cap places a limit on the increase in the airport charges yield, Heathrow has the discretion on whether to
price to the maximum permitted level. Therefore, Heathrow can choose to price charges below the cap. For example, if
there is unused capacity, Heathrow could choose to set prices below the cap in order to stimulate demand.

The price control conditions set by the CAA include the following components for the maximum allowable yield:

## • The “S factor” mechanism is designed to adjust the maximum allowable yield within the relevant
Quinquennium for either additional or reduced security costs incurred as a result of new UK legislation or EU
security directives applicable in the UK. For the current regulatory period, the adjustment enables Heathrow to
pass through 90 per cent. of any additional (or reduced) security costs around a deadband of £19 million.

## • The “K factor” is designed to correct for any under recovery (dilution) or over recovery (concentration) in
airport charges compared to the annual maximum allowable yield per passenger. Under or over recoveries
generally arise due to changes in traffic mix or average loads compared to those forecast at the time prices
were set for the relevant year. For example, an increase in the proportion of long haul departing passengers
would result in yield concentration leading to an over recovery. Conversely, an increase in average load factors
or the proportion of transfer passengers would cause yield dilution. The K factor adjustment is applied to the
maximum allowable yield calculation two years after the year in which it is incurred and therefore can be
carried forward to the following Quinquennium.

## • There is a capital expenditure “trigger” term built into the price control for Heathrow, with provision for the
maximum allowable yield to be reduced if specified project milestones are not delivered on time.

  - There is a development capital expenditure adjustment, with provision for the maximum allowable yield to be
adjusted to account for changes in the revenue requirement associated with development capital projects.

## • There is a service quality rebate scheme at Heathrow Airport which sets defined service standards for a range
of services and facilities. See “—Heathrow Price Regulation—SQR Scheme” below.

**Regulatory Asset Base**

As with other regulated utilities in the UK, the RAB acts as a unit of regulatory value and does not correspond to
statutory asset values. The CAA has historically calculated a forecast of the value of the RAB for Heathrow over each
year of the Quinquennium. The closing RAB for Heathrow for each year is taken to be the sum of the opening RAB,
plus capital expenditure (unless disallowed by the CAA) plus an adjustment for RPI inflation less regulatory
depreciation (including the pricing profile adjustment _—_ see “—The Price Cap” above) and less proceeds of any
disposals at the airport.

The CAA does not update the value of the RAB during each Quinquennium. Heathrow is required to submit regulatory
accounts to the CAA as at 31 December of each year identifying, among other things, the value of the RAB. A decision
as to whether the current period RAB has been appropriately updated during the current regulatory period is not made
until the CAA sets the opening RAB for the next Quinquennium as part of the price control review.

The RAB is independently verified by Heathrow’s statutory auditors and included in the regulatory accounts which are
provided annually to (but not approved by) the CAA.

**HEATHROW PRICE REGULATION**

**Key Elements of the CAA’s Q6 Decision**

The CAA’s decision in respect of Heathrow for Q6 was published on 10 January 2014 and subsequently set out in
Heathrow’s licence issued on 13 February 2014. The key elements of the CAA’s licence for the 4 year and 9 month
period covered by Q6 include:

   - a continuation of the RAB-based construct using the single-till and incentive based regulation in the form of an
RPI based price cap;

   - a maximum allowable yield based on RPI -1.5 per cent.;

   - a WACC (weighted average cost of capital, which is the CAA’s assessment, using a notional capital structure
of 60 per cent. debt and 40 per cent. equity, of the allowed blended cost of debt and return on equity to satisfy
the requirements of capital providers over the Quinquennium) of 5.35 per cent. (pre-tax real);

60


-----

   - assumed capital expenditure of £2.816 billion (in 2011/12 prices);

   - projected operating costs of £4.731 billion (in 2011/12 prices);

   - a “write down” of £30 million to the RAB to reflect the CAA’s view of capital inefficiency on a specific
project undertaken during Q5;

   - forecast aggregate passengers of 347.7 million including an allowance for the impact of demand “shocks”
(other than macro-economic related impacts) in the derivation of the passenger forecast;

   - a split between “core” and “development” capital expenditure to allow for greater flexibility in the capital
planning process. Under this arrangement, designation of capital expenditure as core represents firm
investment commitments at the start of the Q6 price control period where the scope and cost estimate was
reasonably certain. Designation of capital expenditure as development enables projects to be included over the
Q6 price control period that were not sufficiently scoped or costed at the start of Q6. The CAA set an initial
capital expenditure envelope for Q6 comprising a fixed allowance for core capital expenditure and an
indicative allowance for development capital; and

   - a business rates revaluation factor to pass through changes in rates costs arising from the 2017 national
business rates revaluation process above or below a 9 per cent. increase.

**Q6 Extension and H7**

In July 2016 the CAA launched a consultation on the potential extension of Q6. The CAA argued that extending Q6
would reduce the risk of a sub-optimal process to agreeing future price period conditions due to the uncertainty
regarding potential new runway capacity.

Following this process, in December 2016, Heathrow’s licence was modified (which took effect from 1 February 2017)
to extend Heathrow’s current regulatory period (which previously ran from 1 April 2014 to 31 December 2018) by one
year so that it will end on 31 December 2019, rolling over the current price control of RPI-1.5 per cent. for the
additional year.

The CAA has indicated it is open to considering a further one year extension of Heathrow’s current regulatory period to
31 December 2020 and has committed to making a decision on this by 30 June 2017.

On 1 March 2016, the CAA published its “Strategic Themes for the Review of Heathrow Airport’s Charges (H7)”
document. This document set out the CAA’s key milestones and details four key priorities for the next regulatory
period (“H7”) which will commence once Q6 expires. The four priorities are ‘empowering consumers and furthering
their interests’, incentivising the right consumer outcomes’, increasing airport resilience’ and ‘promoting cost efficiency
and financeability’. The CAA’s document highlighted potential regulatory arrangements that could apply in H7,
including a potential move from RPI to CPI regulation. The CAA’s consultation closed at the end of April 2016.

Following its decision to extend Q6 by one year, the CAA has issued a revised timetable for H7. The CAA published
updated guidance on its business plan expectations and outcomes for H7 in April 2017, setting out its latest thinking on
the framework for the H7 review.

**SQR Scheme**

Heathrow’s licence for Q6 includes a service quality rebate (“SQR”) scheme similar to the SQR scheme that applied
during Q5 with defined service targets for a range of services relating to passengers’ experience such as security
queuing times, departure lounge seat availability, cleanliness, way-finding, flight information, arrivals baggage reclaim
availability, the availability of equipment such as lifts, escalators and people movers and the availability of and access
to infrastructure such as Piers, jetties and stands. The service standards cover other areas such as airfield congestion.

To the extent that Heathrow does not achieve the defined standards, rebates to airlines are required. The maximum total
revenue at risk during the Quinquennium is 7 per cent. of the total airport charges. Heathrow can achieve a 1.44 per
cent. revenue upside in the form of a bonus if it exceeds certain SQR targets.

As a proportion of total airport charges, rebates are up to a total of approximately 2.6 per cent. for departure lounge seat
availability, cleanliness, way-finding, flight information, arrivals baggage reclaim and equipment availability, 1.2 per
cent. for infrastructure availability and access, 1.1 per cent. for passenger security queuing times and 1.0 per cent. for
airfield congestion.

Over the six years of Q5 up to 31 March 2014, Heathrow incurred total rebates of £38 million (approximately 0.6 per
cent. of aeronautical income over the period). In the period from 1 April 2014 to 31 December 2016, Heathrow incurred
total rebates of £9 million (approximately 0.2 per cent. of aeronautical income over the period).

61


-----

**Heathrow s Licence**

Heathrow’s licence includes a self-modification provision allowing for Heathrow and airlines to agree immediate
changes to the SQR scheme and for the CAA to act as arbiter if the parties cannot reach agreement on the proposed
changes.

Heathrow’s licence for Q6 includes the price control and SQR conditions described above. Other key elements of the
licence include:

  - Revocation: Heathrow’s licence will remain in force in perpetuity except for certain limited circumstances in
which the licence may be revoked such as where the licence is no longer required or continued lack of
compliance by Heathrow in relation to regulatory requirements.

  - Financial resilience: the licence contains the following financial resilience conditions:

`o` a restriction on business activities that prohibits Heathrow from undertaking unrelated business
activities and placing the regulated business at risk which reflects the Permitted Business restriction in
the Common Terms Agreement;

`o` a requirement on the directors of Heathrow to provide an annual certificate on the adequacy of
resources to continue to provide airport operation services at Heathrow Airport for the following 2
years;

`o` an undertaking from FGP Topco Limited, Heathrow’s ultimate holding company, not to do anything
that would put Heathrow in breach of its licence;

`o` a requirement for Heathrow to put in place a continuity of service plan;

`o` a requirement for Heathrow to provide prior written notice to the CAA if it intends to amend its
financing arrangements in respect of credit rating requirements; and

`o` an obligation on Heathrow to notify the CAA in the event of Heathrow (or any company within its
group where the financial position of that company or its inability to continue to trade would have an
adverse effect on Heathrow’s financial position or ability to continue to trade) seeking advice from an
insolvency practitioner or any other person relating to Heathrow’s financial position or ability to
continue to trade.

  - operational resilience: The licence includes a condition relating to the need to secure the availability and
continuity of airport operation services, particularly in times of disruption.

  - procurement: The licence includes a condition requiring Heathrow to ensure its procurement of capital projects
is efficient and economical, and that it must publish its policies and procedures on how it will achieve this.

  - planning and delivery of capital projects: The CAA noted in its notice granting the licence in February 2014
that it has identified a possible need for a new licence condition. The new licence condition, relating to the
planning and delivery of capital projects possibly putting greater accountability on Heathrow to ensure
efficient delivery and engagement with the airline community, is to be developed when the licence is in place.
To date, the CAA has not initiated work on a possible new licence condition.

**AERODROME LICENCES**
Heathrow is subject to aerodrome licensing, which requires the operator to demonstrate that it is competent to conduct
aerodrome operations safely.

The CAA must grant a licence in respect of any aerodrome in the UK if it is satisfied that:

## • the applicant is competent, having regard to its previous conduct and experience, equipment, organisation,
staffing, maintenance and other arrangements, to secure that the aerodrome and the airspace within which its
visual traffic pattern is normally contained are safe for use by aircraft; and

## • the aerodrome is safe for use by aircraft, having regard in particular to the physical characteristics of the
aerodrome and of its surroundings.

Heathrow has an aerodrome licence for Heathrow Airport.

62


-----

In mid 2016, Heathrow completed its transition from an aerodrome license for Heathrow Airport to a certificate issued
in accordance with the new European Aviation Safety Agency’s (“EASA”) regime. The EASA regime allows National
Aviation Authorities (“NAAs”) and airports to convert their existing aerodrome licences to the new EASA certificate.
The CAA will still be the primary regulatory point of contact for Heathrow Airport. It will remain the CAA’s
responsibility to conduct audits of the airport in its capacity as an NAA. However, EASA may conduct audits of the
CAA (and other NAAs) to ensure standardisation across member states.

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

**£275 MILLION NOTES DUE 2019 AND £250 MILLION NOTES DUE 2025**
On 14 December 2012, the Issuer issued £275 million 5.375 per cent. Senior Secured Notes due 2019 (the “2019
**Notes”). On 16 October 2014, the Issuer issued £250 million 5.75 per cent. Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the “2025**
**Notes”). The 2019 Notes and the 2025 Notes are governed by terms and conditions which are identical in all material**
respects to the terms and conditions of the Notes except as to interest, maturity, the definition of Permitted Holders and
the Group RAR financial covenant. The 2019 Notes and the 2025 Notes are secured by fixed and floating security over
substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and of Heathrow (DSH) Limited (including the issued share capital of the
Issuer and Security Parent) as described below under “—Security”.

**ISSUER FACILITIES**
The Issuer currently has in place three loan facility agreements in respect of (i) facilities of £175 million with various
maturities up to 2025 (the “2014 Issuer Facility”); (ii) facilities of £200 million with various maturities up to 2025 (the
“2016 Issuer Facility”) and (iii) a facility of £150 million maturing in 2028 (the “2016 Issuer Facility 2” and (i), (ii)
and (iii) together, the “Issuer Facilities”). The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and Lloyds Bank plc act as agents and
Deutsche Trustee Company Limited acts as security agent respectively in relation to the Issuer Facilities.

The Issuer Facilities are secured by fixed and floating security over substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and of
Heathrow (DSH) Limited (including the issued share capital of the Issuer and Security Parent) as described below under
“—Security”.

**Repayments and Prepayments**

Subject to certain conditions, the Issuer may voluntarily prepay and/or permanently cancel all or part (being a minimum
amount of £10,000,000) of the loans or available commitments (as appropriate) under the Issuer Facilities by giving
three business days' prior notice to the agent. Amounts prepaid may not be reborrowed.

In addition to voluntary prepayments, the Issuer Facilities require mandatory cancellation and, if applicable, prepayment
(or, as the case may be, an offer to do so) in full or in part in certain circumstances, including:

- with respect to any lender, if it is or will become unlawful for such lender to perform any of its obligations under
the Issuer Facilities; and

- upon the occurrence of a sale of the whole or substantially all of the Group's business and assets.

Upon a change of control, the Issuer must notify the agent of such change of control. If there is a change of control,
each lender may elect to cancel its commitments immediately and declare all amounts owing to it under the Issuer
Facilities due and payable immediately.

**Interest and Margins**

Loans under the Issuer Facilities bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus the applicable margin and any
mandatory cost.

The applicable margins for Facility A, Facility B and Facility C of the 2014 Issuer Facility are 2.75 per cent. per annum
3.00 per cent. per annum and 3.55 per cent. per annum, respectively. The applicable average margins for Facility A,
Facility B and Facility C of the 2016 Issuer Facility 1 are 3.00 per cent. per annum, 3.15 per cent. per annum and 3.45
per cent. per annum, respectively. The applicable margin for the 2016 Issuer Facility 2 is 3.75 per cent. per annum.

**Security**

Both the Issuer and Heathrow (DSH) Limited have entered into debentures granting fixed and floating security over
substantially all of their assets and undertaking (including, without limitation, a first ranking charge of all the issued
share capital of the Security Parent and the Issuer, respectively) to secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Issuer
Facilities. The holders of the Notes, the holders of the 2019 Notes, the holders of the 2025 Notes and any hedge
counterparties also benefit from this security package as will any additional third party creditor which becomes a
Secured Party in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. The security securing the Issuer Facilities
rank and secure the Issuer Facilities, the Notes, the 2019 Notes, the 2025 Notes, any other Bond Liabilities, any other
Credit Facilities Liabilities and any Hedging Liabilities (as those terms are defined in “Terms and Conditions of the
_Notes”) pari passu pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (see “—Intercreditor Agreement”)._

67


-----

**Representations**

The Issuer Facilities include standard representations and warranties, which include, amongst others, valid power and
authority to enter into the agreement, compliance with applicable laws, no misleading information and that the Issuer
has good title to its assets.

**Financial Covenants**

In addition to the general covenants described below, the Issuer Facilities each contain a financial covenant requiring
the Group to maintain (i) a Group RAR (as defined in “Terms and Conditions of the Notes”) not greater than 92.5 per
cent.; and (ii) a Group ICR (as defined in “Terms and Conditions of the Notes”) not less than 1.0 in respect of each
period of 12 months ended each 31 December after the Issuer Facilities were entered into. The Issuer will be able to
cure any breaches of these financial covenants up to twice (in non-consecutive years) during the life of each of the
Issuer Facilities.

**General Covenants**

The Issuer Facilities contain positive and negative covenants. The restrictions on investments, negative pledge,
disposals, affiliate transactions, indebtedness, dividends and share capital (save for certain agreed deviations) follow the
relevant provisions of the Notes, as described in more detail in “Terms and Conditions of the Notes”.

**Events of Default**

In addition, the Issuer Facilities provide events of default, including, among others, the following:

- non-payment, subject to a 3 business day grace period for administrative and technical errors;

- breach of financial covenants with no grace period;

- breach of other obligations, subject to a 20 business day grace period;

- misrepresentation, subject to a 20 business day grace period;

- cross default;

- insolvency, insolvency proceedings and creditor process, subject (where relevant) to a 28 day grace period;

- unlawfulness and invalidity;

- cessation of business;

- termination of licence;

- audit qualification;

- repudiation and rescission of agreement; and

- litigation and creditor's process.

Upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of the Issuer Facilities, the relevant agent may, among other
things, declare all of the loans and all other amounts payable thereunder to be immediately due and payable or to be
payable on demand.

**INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT**

**General**

The Issuer and Heathrow (DSH) Limited have entered into an intercreditor agreement (the “Intercreditor
**Agreement”) with, among others, the security agent, the agents under the Issuer Facilities, the trustee for the 2019**
Notes, the trustee for the 2025 Notes and any hedging creditors. The Trustee will accede to the Intercreditor Agreement
on or about the issue date of the Notes.

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the term “Secured Parties” is defined to mean the security agent, the agents,
arrangers and lenders under the Issuer Facilities, the Trustee in its capacity as trustee for the holders of the Notes, the
holders of the 2019 Notes and the holders of the 2025 Notes, any hedging creditor, any future secured creditor which
has acceded as a party to the Intercreditor Agreement in the relevant capacity and any receiver or delegate appointed by
the security agent pursuant to any of the security documents.

68


-----

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law.

The Intercreditor Agreement includes terms that establish:

- the ranking and priority of the liabilities owed to the lenders under the Issuer Facilities, to the Trustee in its
capacity as the trustee for the holders of the Notes, the holders of the 2019 Notes and the holders of the 2025
Notes, to the hedging creditors and to Heathrow (DSH) Limited with respect to liabilities owed by the Issuer to
Heathrow (DSH) Limited (“Parent Liabilities”);

- the basis on which the security agent is appointed to hold the collateral created by the security documents;

- under what circumstances the security documents may be enforced;

- the application of proceeds from an enforcement in respect of the collateral; and

- under which circumstances the collateral may be shared on a _pari passu basis with additional third party_
creditors.

**Priority of Secured Obligations**

The Intercreditor Agreement purports to rank (in right and priority of payment) the debt held by the Secured Parties
under the Issuer Facilities, the trust deed for the 2019 Notes, the trust deed for the 2025 Notes, the Trust Deed and the
hedging agreements (the “Secured Obligations”), together with the collateral that secures such Secured Obligations,
_pari passu without any preference between any such class of Secured Obligations._

**Incremental and Refinancing Debt**

The Intercreditor Agreement permits certain additional secured debt, including any debt which is raised pursuant to
additional credit facilities and additional bonds or notes issued by the Issuer and which are permitted under the terms of
the Issuer Facilities, the trust deed for the 2019 Notes, the trust deed for the 2025 Notes and the Trust Deed to share in
the collateral and rank pari passu alongside the other Secured Obligations.

**Prohibited Actions**

The Intercreditor Agreement does not limit the making of:

- payments, distributions or other actions in respect of the Secured Obligations under the Issuer Facilities;

- payments (including in respect of scheduled interest and principal) in respect of the Secured Obligations under
the Trust Deed; and

- payments in respect of the Secured Obligations under the hedging agreements (subject to certain restrictions as
set out in the Intercreditor Agreement),

in each case, in accordance with terms of the documents governing the relevant class of Secured Obligations.

Following the occurrence of certain acceleration and/or insolvency events all payments in respect of Secured
Obligations must be applied in accordance with the payment waterfall set out in the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement prohibits Parent Liabilities from receiving the benefit of any security, guarantee,
indemnity or other assurance against loss and, prior to the final discharge of all obligations under the Secured
Obligations or an insolvency event, prohibits the taking of any enforcement action by the Parent with respect to Parent
Liabilities.

**Enforcement of Security Documents**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that only the security agent will have the right to enforce the security documents.

Under the Intercreditor Agreement and subject to the security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms,
the security agent shall determine the nature, management, timing and control of any enforcement of the security
documents on the instructions of the Secured Parties who, in the aggregate, hold more than 50 per cent. of the amounts
under the Issuer Facilities (and certain additional credit facilities), any hedging arrangements and the Notes then
outstanding (including certain additional notes) (the “Majority Primary Creditors”). In the absence of such
instructions, the security agent shall act as it sees fit.

69


-----

The security agent will not be liable in any respect to any Secured Party or any other person for exercising (or failing to
exercise) any of its rights, powers or discretions in relation to the security documents. The security agent may disregard
any instructions to enforce any security if those instructions are inconsistent with the Intercreditor Agreement.

**Snooze/Lose**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that if in relation to a request for a consent to participate in a vote or to approve
any other action or provide any confirmation or notification under the Intercreditor Agreement, the agent under the
Issuer Facilities, the Trustee (in its capacity as trustee for the holders of the Notes, the holders of the 2019 Notes or the
holders of the 2025 Notes) or a hedge counterparty (each, for itself and on behalf of the creditors it represents) fails to
respond to that request within 20 business days of the request being made, the consent or vote of such party (and the
aggregate principal amount of indebtedness represented by such party) shall be disregarded for the purposes of
ascertaining whether an agreement has been obtained, a vote carried or another action approved, and, in the case of any
confirmation or notification, that confirmation or notification will be deemed to have been given.

**Enforcement Proceeds**

The Intercreditor Agreement regulates the order in which amounts received by the security agent (including upon
enforcement of the collateral) are distributed to the Secured Parties.

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the parties agree that, following any enforcement of the security documents, the
claims of the security agent, any receiver or delegate appointed by the security agent pursuant to any of the security
documents will have first ranking claims (without any priority between themselves), followed by the costs and expenses
of any Secured Party (including the Trustee and the agents) incurred in realisation or enforcement of the security
documents, and then followed by claims in respect of the obligations under the Issuer Facilities, the obligations under
the trust deed for the 2019 Notes, the obligations under the trust deed for the 2025 Notes, the Trust Deed, the
obligations of any hedging creditor and the obligations under any other additional bonds or additional credit facilities
permitted under the Trust Deed and the Intercreditor Agreement ranking _pari passu and_ _pro rata according to the_
respective amounts among themselves, and finally followed by any claim which the security agent is obliged to pay in
priority to the Issuer or Heathrow (DSH) Limited. The balance (if any) will be paid to the Issuer and Heathrow (DSH)
Limited. The security agent will apply amounts received following enforcement, including recoveries from
enforcement, in accordance with this priority.

The Intercreditor Agreement contains customary turnover provisions.

**Appointment of Security Agent**

The Intercreditor Agreement sets out the terms on which the security agent holds the benefit of the security documents.

The security agent shall not be obliged to take any action (including with respect to taking enforcement proceedings or
enforcing the security documents) unless indemnified, secured or prepaid to its satisfaction. The security agent shall be
entitled to accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of banking or other business with
either the Issuer or Heathrow (DSH) Limited.

Unless acting on the instruction of the Majority Primary Creditors, or exercising certain specific discretions granted to it
under the Intercreditor Agreement, in exercising any discretion to exercise a right, power or authority under the
Intercreditor Agreement, the security agent shall do so having regard to the interests of all the Secured Parties.

The security agent is not obliged to insure any collateral, or require any other person to maintain such insurance, and
will not be responsible for any loss, expense or liability which may be suffered as a result of the lack of, or inadequacy
of, such insurance. Each Secured Party (other than the security agent) is responsible for undertaking its own
independent appraisal and investigation of all risks arising under or in connection with the Intercreditor Agreement and
related documents, including in respect of the financial condition, status and nature of each member of the Group and
the title of any security provider to the collateral. Neither the security agent nor any receiver or delegate shall be liable
for (among other things) validity, effectiveness, adequacy or enforceability of the collateral.

**Release of Transaction Security**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the security agent may release the collateral (and the obligations of the
obligors) under certain conditions, including in connection with the enforcement of the security documents or in
connection with the sale or disposal of assets permitted by each relevant financing document.

70


-----

**Common Security**

None of the lenders under the Issuer Facilities, the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes, the holders of the 2019
Notes and the holders of the 2025 Notes, or the hedging creditors may take the benefit of any security or guarantees in
respect of their respective Secured Obligations other than under the relevant financing documents and the security
documents.

**Amendments**

The security agent, the Issuer and Heathrow (DSH) Limited each has the right to make amendments which are minor or
of a technical nature to the Intercreditor Agreement without any further consent from the Secured Parties. Other
amendments or waivers of the Intercreditor Agreement may be made only with the consent of the agent under each
Issuer Facility, the Trustee as representative of the holders of the Notes, the 2019 Notes and the 2025 Notes, the trustee
or agent under any additional bonds or additional credit facilities permitted by the Trust Deed and the Intercreditor
Agreement, the security agent and Heathrow (DSH) Limited, except that any amendment, waiver or consent that only
affects the rights and obligations of certain parties (and which could not reasonably be expected to be adverse to the
interests of the other parties) requires the consent only of the parties so affected. Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the
security agent may—if so instructed by the Majority Primary Creditors, and if Heathrow (DSH) Limited consents—
amend the terms of, waive requirements of or grant consents under any of the relevant security documents, provided
that for releases of security, claims or liabilities or any consents given by the security agent in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, any amendment, waiver or consent related to the security documents which affects the nature
or scope of the security or the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the security are distributed requires the
prior consent of the Secured Parties.

**SENIOR BORROWER GROUP INDEBTEDNESS**
As at 31 March 2017, the Senior Borrower Group had indebtedness totalling £12,252 million under revolving credit
facilities (the “RCF”), a revolving working capital facility, a liquidity facility (the “Senior Borrower Liquidity
**Facility”), term loans from the European Investment Bank, other term debt (together, the “Authorised Senior Credit**
**Facilities” and each an “Authorised Senior Credit Facility”) and borrower loan agreements between Heathrow and**
Heathrow Funding Limited, which correspond in their terms to each series of bonds (the “Senior Bonds”) issued by
Heathrow Funding Limited (the “Borrower Loan Agreements” and, together with the Authorised Senior Credit
Facilities, the “Senior Borrower Group Indebtedness”). The Senior Borrower Group can issue senior ranking debt
(“Senior Debt”) and junior ranking debt (“Junior Debt”).

The Senior Borrower Group Indebtedness is secured by substantially all the assets of each of the members of the Senior
Borrower Group (the “Senior Obligors” and each a “Senior Obligor”) and guarantees by each Senior Obligor in
respect of each other's obligations, in favour of the lenders under the Senior Borrower Group Indebtedness (the “Senior
**Borrower Secured Creditors”). In addition, Heathrow Funding Limited as issuer of the Senior Bonds provided**
security over substantially all of its assets in favour of the trustee under the Senior Bonds and holders of the Senior
Bonds.

A common terms agreement (the “CTA”) sets out the common warranties, covenants, trigger events or loan events of
default applicable to the Senior Borrower Group Indebtedness. The Senior Borrower Secured Creditors have also
entered into intercreditor arrangements, contained in a security trust and intercreditor deed (the “STID”). These are
described below.

If the Senior Borrower Group fails to make payments or comply with the covenants in respect of its financing, this may
result in a default under the Senior Borrower Group financing and the insolvency of the Senior Borrower Group. The
Notes will be subordinated to all liabilities of the Senior Borrower Group and so in such circumstances the Issuer's
ability to make payments under the Notes would be severely restricted and there might be no returns in relation to the
Notes.

**CTA**
**_General_**

The CTA sets out certain representations, covenants, Trigger Events and Loan Events of Default which apply to each
Authorised Senior Credit Facility including the Borrower Loan Agreements. A copy of the CTA is available on the
Heathrow Airport Holdings Group's website and is incorporated by reference in this Prospectus.

**_Covenants_**

The covenants are positive, negative, informational and financial in nature. They include an undertaking by LHR
Airports Limited as the agent of the Senior Borrower Group (the “Senior Borrower Group Agent”) to provide

71


-----

consolidated audited financial statements of the Senior Borrower Group and Heathrow Funding Limited for each
financial year and consolidated, unaudited financial information for the financial half-year.

The Senior Borrower Group Agent must also supply an Investor Report by 30 June and 31 December each year which
includes a general update on the Senior Borrower Group, regulatory and business developments and capital expenditure.

Each Senior Obligor has undertaken not to incur any Financial Indebtedness other than Permitted Financial
Indebtedness. The incurrence of additional Senior Debt or Junior Debt is subject to certain conditions including that the
Senior RAR, the ratio of Senior Debt to the total RAB must be less than 0.725 and the Junior RAR, the ratio of Junior
Debt to the total RAB must be less than 0.90, in each case calculated taking account of the proposed additional
Financial Indebtedness. In addition, there are provisions which restrict the amount of Financial Indebtedness which can
fall due (a) within any 24-month period to 30 per cent. of total RAB and (b) within any Five-Year Period to 50 per cent.
of total RAB.

Heathrow cannot be sold without approval from the requisite majority of qualifying Senior Borrower Secured Creditors.
In addition to the restrictions on financial indebtedness and disposals, the CTA also contains a number of covenants
which regulate the Senior Obligors' activities including, among others:

(1) limitations on non-permitted business;

(2) limitations on joint ventures;

(3) a negative pledge; and

(4) a requirement to comply with specified insurance and outsourcing policies.

**_Trigger Events_**

The CTA sets out certain trigger events including:

(1) any breach of the following financial ratios:

(A) the Senior RAR as at any Relevant Date prior to 1 April 2018 is, or is estimated to be, more than 0.70 and
thereafter is, or is estimated to be, more than 0.725;

(B) the Junior RAR as at any Relevant Date is, or is estimated to be, more than 0.85;

(C) the Senior ICR for each Relevant Period is, or is estimated to be, less than 1.40; or

(D) the Junior ICR for each Relevant Period is, or is estimated to be, less than 1.20;

(2) credit rating downgrades on the Senior Bonds;

(4) the commencement of the final reading of draft legislation in the House of Lords or the House of Commons
(whichever occurs later) relating to the business of any Senior Obligor if such legislation could (if enacted)
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

(5) forecast Capital Expenditure over the 12 month period following a Calculation Date exceeds the aggregate of
undrawn RCF, cash and Projected Excess Cashflow Before Capex over such 12 month period;

(6) the amount available under the Issuer Liquidity Facilities/any cash liquidity reserve is less than the estimated
interest and equivalent finance charges for (a) the 12 month period following a Calculation Date in respect of
Issuer Senior Debt and (b) the six-month period following a Calculation Date in respect of Issuer Junior Debt;

(7) the issue of any compliance or enforcement order by any Regulator which would reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect; or

(8) the issue of a termination notice or a notice of any proposed or actual modification in respect of any licence by a
Regulator which, if implemented, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

The occurrence of a Trigger Event gives rise to various consequences including a block on Restricted Payments, the
preparation of remedial plans and a termination plan in respect of the Shared Services Agreement, and a right for the
security trustee under the Senior Borrower Group Indebtedness to request to participate in discussions with the
Regulator.

72


-----

**_Loan Events of Default_**

The CTA contains a number of Loan Events of Default (subject, in some cases, to agreed exceptions, materiality
qualifications, reservations of law and grace periods) including:

(1) non-payment by a Senior Obligor of amounts payable under the Finance Documents;

(2) a breach of the following financial ratios:

(A) if the Senior RAR as stated in the compliance certificate produced in respect of the reporting date falling
in June in respect of 31 December of the preceding financial year is more than 0.925; and/or

(B) if the Average Senior ICR as stated in the compliance certificate produced in respect of the reporting date
falling in June is less than 1.05;

(3) non-compliance with any term of any covenant or undertaking in any Finance Document;

(4) a representation made or repeated by a Senior Obligor in any Finance Document being incorrect or misleading in
any material respect when made or deemed to be repeated;

(5) the insolvency of a Senior Obligor;

(6) it becoming unlawful for any Senior Obligor to perform its obligations under any transaction document;

(7) certain changes in law; or

(8) the occurrence of an event of default under the Senior Bonds.

In respect of each Loan Event of Default requiring any action or discretion on the part of the relevant creditor, the
security trustee under the Senior Borrower Group Indebtedness will act in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the STID.

**_Hedging Policy_**

The Senior Borrowers are subject to a Hedging Policy which is set out at Schedule 5 of the CTA. The Senior Borrowers
have entered into and in the future may enter into various interest rate, inflation-linked and currency hedging
transactions in conformity with the Hedging Policy.

**Security Trust And Intercreditor Deed (“STID”)**

The intercreditor arrangements among the Senior Borrower Secured Creditors of the Senior Borrower Group (the
“Senior Intercreditor Arrangements”) are contained in the STID. Creditors of debt not secured by the collateral
securing the liabilities under the CTA are not and will not become parties to the Senior Intercreditor Arrangements and
will not be subject to their terms. However, the aggregate amount of such Financial Indebtedness is restricted under the
CTA.

The purpose of the Senior Intercreditor Arrangements is to regulate, among other things: (i) the claims of the Senior
Borrower Secured Creditors and their ranking in point of payment after the delivery of a Loan Enforcement Notice; (ii)
the exercise, acceleration and enforcement of rights by the Senior Borrower Secured Creditors; (iii) the rights of the
Senior Borrower Secured Creditors to instruct the security trustee under the Senior Borrower Group Indebtedness; and
(iv) the giving of consents and waivers and the making of modifications to the CTA, the Security Documents, the
Shared Services Agreement, the STID, the Master Definitions Agreement and the Tax Deed of Covenant (the
“Common Documents”). The Senior Intercreditor Arrangements provide for the subordination and postponement of all
claims in respect of Financial Indebtedness of any Heathrow Airport Holdings Group company or Affiliate thereof that
is not a member of the Senior Borrower Group and following delivery of a Loan Acceleration Notice, payments under
the Shared Services Agreement and certain other contracts otherwise entered into in accordance with the CTA.

As regards the giving of consents and waivers and the making of modifications in relation to the Common Documents,
the STID contains provisions which enable the security trustee under the Senior Borrower Group Indebtedness to give
or permit the making thereof in certain circumstances (principally where it determines that the consent, waiver or
modification will not be materially prejudicial to Senior Borrower Secured Creditors). Where the security trustee under
the Senior Borrower Group Indebtedness is not willing or able to exercise its discretion, approval from relevant
qualifying Senior Borrower Secured Creditors is required. Consents, waivers or modifications may, depending on their
nature, constitute Ordinary Voting Matters or Extraordinary Voting Matters. In addition, they may constitute an
Entrenched Right in respect of one or more Senior Borrower Secured Creditors, with the result that the consent of such
Senior Borrower Secured Creditors will need to be obtained. Voting is effected on a “one pound equals one vote” basis,

73

except that, in the case of bank debt, the entirety of the relevant outstanding bank debt will vote in accordance with the
instructions given by the relevant majority of the bank lenders in respect of such debt.

There are also provisions which enable instructions to be given to the security trustee under the Senior Borrower Group
Indebtedness by the required percentage of Qualifying Senior Borrower Secured Creditors in relation to a number of
matters, including whether to enforce the security following a Loan Event of Default and whether to deliver a Loan
Acceleration Notice.

With exceptions, the Senior Borrowers are generally free to pay debts as they fall due, whether they be in respect of
Senior Debt or Junior Debt, or in respect of unsecured claims. There are, however, priorities of payments which
regulate payments made after the delivery of a Loan Enforcement Notice and after the delivery of a Loan Acceleration
Notice. In addition, the making of certain payments following a Loan Event of Default is regulated.

(ii) such obligation cannot be avoided by the Issuer taking reasonable measures available to it, provided that
no such notice of redemption shall be given earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the

which will be a Business Day no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the Publication Date, or such
later date as is necessary to comply with requirements under any applicable securities laws or regulations.

To exercise the option to require purchase of a Note under this Condition, a Noteholder must deliver such Note,
on any banking business day in the place of delivery prior to the Change of Control Purchase Date (the “Put
**Period”) at the specified office of any Paying Agent, accompanied by a duly signed and completed notice of**
exercise in the form (for the time being current) obtainable from the specified office of any Paying Agent (a “Put
**Notice”) and in which the Noteholder may specify a bank account complying with the requirements of Condition**
8 (Payments) to which payment is to be made under this Condition. Notes should be delivered together with all
Coupons appertaining thereto maturing after the date (the “Put Date”), which is seven days after the expiration

-----

of the Put Period, failing which deduction in respect of such missing unmatured Coupons shall be made in
accordance with Condition 8 (Payments) and any amount so deducted will be reimbursed in the manner specified
in Condition 8 (Payments). The Paying Agent to which such Note and Put Notice are delivered will issue to the
Noteholder concerned a non-transferable receipt in respect of the Note so delivered. If the Put Date is an Interest
Payment Date, payment of the accrued interest in respect of any Note so delivered will be made in the manner
provided in Condition 8 (Payments) against presentation and surrender of the relevant Coupon. If the Put Date is
not an Interest Payment Date, payment of the accrued interest, and in all cases, payment of principal in respect of
any Note so delivered will be made, if the Noteholder duly specified a bank account in the Put Notice to which
payment is to be made, on the Put Date by transfer to that bank account and in every other case on or after the
Put Date against presentation and surrender or (as the case may be) endorsement of such receipt at the specified
office of any Paying Agent in accordance with Condition 8 (Payments). A Put Notice, once given, shall be
irrevocable. For all relevant purposes of these Conditions, receipts issued pursuant to this Condition shall be
treated as if they were Notes. The Issuer shall purchase (or procure the purchase of) the relevant Notes on the Put
Date unless previously redeemed or purchased and cancelled.

(c) The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if a third party makes the Change of Control
Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in these Conditions
applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and offers to purchase all Notes validly tendered and
not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. The Change of Control provisions of this Condition will be
applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Trust Deed are applicable.

(d) To the extent the Issuer complies with applicable tender offer rules and any other applicable securities laws and
regulations and such rules, laws and regulations conflict with the provisions of this Condition 7.3, the Issuer will
not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Condition and the Trust Deed by virtue of such
conflict.

7.4 _Sinking Fund; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases; Cancellation of Notes_
(a) The Issuer is not required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the
Notes.

(b) The Issuer and any of its Subsidiaries may at any time purchase Notes in the open market or otherwise at any
price (provided that they are purchased together with all unmatured Coupons relating to them).

(c) All Notes so redeemed or purchased and any unmatured Coupons attached to or surrendered with them may, but
need not, be cancelled at the election of the Issuer. Any Notes or Coupons so cancelled will not be re-issued or
resold.

(d) Where Notes redeemed pursuant to this Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase) are cancelled upon redemption,
any unmatured Coupons appertaining to such Notes, whether or not attached thereto or surrendered therewith,
shall also be cancelled and may not be resold or re-issued.

**8.** **PAYMENTS**
(a) Payments of principal and premium (if any) and payments of interest due on each Interest Payment Date will be
made against presentation and surrender (or, in the case of a partial payment, endorsement) of Notes or the
appropriate Coupons (as the case may be) at the specified office of any Paying Agent by Sterling cheque drawn
on, or by transfer to a Sterling account maintained by the payee with, a bank in London. Payments of interest due
in respect of any Note other than on an Interest Payment Date shall be made only against presentation and either
surrender or endorsement (as appropriate) of the relevant Note.

(b) All payments are subject in all cases to any applicable fiscal or other laws and regulations, but without prejudice
to the provisions of Condition 10 (Taxation). No commissions or expenses shall be charged to the Noteholders or
Couponholders in respect of such payments.

(c) Each Note should be presented for payment together with all unmatured Coupons relating to it, failing which the
full amount of any such missing unmatured Coupon (or, in the case of payment not being made in full, that
proportion of the full amount of such missing unmatured Coupon which the amount so paid bears to the total
amount due) will be deducted from the amount due for payment. Each amount so deducted will be paid in the
manner mentioned above against presentation and surrender (or, in the case of part payment only, endorsement)
of such missing Coupon at any time before the expiry of ten years after the relevant payment date in respect of
the relevant Note (whether or not the Coupon would otherwise have become void pursuant to Condition 9
(Prescription)) or, if later, five years after the date on which the Coupon would have become due, but not
thereafter.

(d) A Note or Coupon may only be presented for payment on a day which is a banking business day in the relevant
place of presentation (and, in the case of payment by transfer to a Sterling account, in London). No further
interest or other payment will be made as a consequence of the day on which the relevant Note or Coupon may
be presented for payment under this paragraph (d) falling after the due date.

83


-----

(e) The initial Paying Agent and its initial specified offices are listed below. The Issuer reserves the right, subject to
the prior written approval of the Trustee, at any time to vary or terminate the appointment of any Paying Agent
and to appoint additional or other Paying Agents; provided that they will at all times maintain:

(i) a Principal Paying Agent; and

(ii) so long as the Notes are listed on any stock exchange or admitted to listing by any other relevant
authority, a Paying Agent with a specified office in such place as may be required by the rules and
regulations of the relevant stock exchange or such other relevant authority.

The initial specified office of the initial Paying Agent is:

Winchester House, 1 Great Winchester Street, London EC2N 2DB.

Notice of any change in the Paying Agents or their specified offices will promptly be given to the Noteholders
by the Issuer in accordance with Condition 20 (Notices).

In acting under the Agency Agreement, the Paying Agents act solely as agents of the Issuer and, in certain
limited circumstances specified therein, of the Trustee and do not assume any obligation to, or relationship of
agency or trust with, the Noteholders or the Couponholders. The Agency Agreement contains provisions
permitting any entity into which any Paying Agent is merged or converted or with which it is consolidated or to
which it transfers all or substantially all of its assets to become the successor paying agent.

**9.** **PRESCRIPTION**
(a) Claims in respect of principal and premium will become void unless the relevant Notes are presented for
payment within a period of ten years from the appropriate payment date.

(b) Claims for interest in respect of Notes shall become void unless the relevant Coupons are presented for payment
within five years of the relevant Interest Payment Date, subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) of Condition 8
(Payments).

**10.** **TAXATION**
All payments by or on behalf of the Issuer under or with respect to the Notes will be made free and clear of and without
withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future Tax imposed or levied on such payments by or
within the United Kingdom or by or within any department, political subdivision or governmental authority of or in the
United Kingdom having power to tax (each, a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), unless the Issuer is required to
withhold or deduct Taxes by law. In that event, the Issuer will pay additional amounts (“Additional Amounts”) as may
be necessary to ensure that the net amount received by each Noteholder and Couponholder after such withholding or
deduction (including any withholding or deduction in respect of any Additional Amounts) will not be less than the
amount the Noteholder or Couponholder, as the case may be, would have received if such Taxes had not been withheld
or deducted.

The Issuer will not, however, pay Additional Amounts in respect of any Note or Coupon:

(a) held by or on behalf of a holder who is liable to such Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or levied by a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction by reason of the holder's present or former connection with such Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (other than the mere receipt, ownership, holding or disposition of Notes or Coupons, or by reason of
the receipt of any payments in respect of any Note or Coupon, or the exercise or enforcement of rights under any
Notes or Coupons);

(b) held by or on behalf of a holder who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting
any form or certificate, or by making a declaration of non-residence or other claim for exemption to the relevant
tax authority; or

(c) presented for payment more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available to the Noteholder or
Couponholder (except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note
been presented on the last day of such 30-day period).

The Issuer will (i) make such withholding or deduction as is required by applicable law and (ii) remit the full amount
deducted or withheld to the relevant authority in accordance with applicable law.

Any reference in these Conditions to any amounts in respect of the Notes shall be deemed also to refer to any
Additional Amounts which may be payable under this Condition or under any undertakings given in addition to, or in
substitution for, this Condition pursuant to the Trust Deed.

If the Issuer becomes subject at any time to any taxing jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom, references in these
Conditions, in respect of payments by the Issuer to the United Kingdom shall be construed as references to the United
Kingdom and/or such other jurisdiction.

(a) Each of the following will be an “Event of Default”:

(i) default for 30 days in the payment when due of any interest or any Additional Amounts on any Note;

an event of default (however described).

No Event of Default will occur under clause (A) or (B) above in respect of Financial Indebtedness if the
aggregate amount of all Financial Indebtedness falling within clauses (A) and (B) above is less than
£50,000,000 (or its equivalent in any other currency or currencies);

(vii) the Transaction Security ceases to be legal, valid, binding, enforceable or effective for any reason other

compulsory manager or other similar officer in respect of the Issuer or a Subsidiary Group

or, in the opinion of the Trustee, any analogous procedure or step is taken in any jurisdiction; provided,
_however, that this clause (a)(x) shall not apply to: (X) any winding-up petition which is frivolous or_
vexatious and is discharged, stayed or dismissed within 28 days of commencement or, if earlier, the date
on which it is advertised; or (Y) an application for the appointment of a receiver, administrative receiver,
administrator, compulsory manager or other similar officer that is discharged at least five days prior to the
first hearing of that application.

_Companies), Condition 4.11(d) (Notification of Defaults and Events of Default) and Condition 4.12 (Merger,_
_Consolidation and Sale of Substantially All Assets)), (a)(vii) or (a)(x) above or any Event of Default of the_
Parent, the Trustee has certified in writing that, in its opinion, the happening of such event is materially
prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders, the Trustee:

(i) may in its absolute discretion; and

(ii) shall if it has been directed to do so:

(A) in writing by the holders of not less than 25 per cent. in aggregate of the principal amount of the

Notes outstanding; or

(B) by an Extraordinary Resolution of the Noteholders,

subject, in each case, to being indemnified and/or pre-funded and/or secured to its satisfaction, give a notice (a
“Note Acceleration Notice”) to the Issuer and the Security Agent declaring the principal of, premium, if any, and
any Additional Amounts and accrued interest on all the outstanding Notes immediately due and payable. The
ability of the Trustee and the Noteholders to declare, and of the Noteholders to direct the Trustee to declare, the
Notes due and payable is subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**12.** **ENFORCEMENT OF SECURITY**
(a) At any time after a Note Acceleration Notice has been given to the Issuer, the Trustee:

(i) may in its absolute discretion; and

(ii) shall if it has been directed to do so:

(A) in writing by the holders of not less than 25 per cent. in aggregate of the principal amount of the
Notes outstanding; or

(B) by an Extraordinary Resolution of the Noteholders,

subject in each case to being indemnified and/or pre-funded and/or secured to its satisfaction in accordance with
the Trust Deed, instruct the Security Agent to make a Request for voting in relation to enforcing the Transaction
Security pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (each, a “Request Instruction”).

(b) The Trustee shall, subject to being indemnified and/or pre-funded and/or secured to its satisfaction in accordance
with the Trust Deed, promptly after receiving any Request in relation to enforcement of the Transaction Security,
give a notice to Noteholders in accordance with Condition 20 (Notices) soliciting the direction from holders of
the Notes then outstanding (each, a “Noteholder Direction”) to the Trustee as to whether to instruct the Security
Agent to take enforcement action in relation to the Transaction Security pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement
(such instruction, an “Enforcement Instruction”). Upon the conclusion of the solicitation of Noteholder
Directions, the Trustee shall inform the Issuer and the Security Agent promptly in writing of the aggregate
principal amount of Notes represented by the holders of Notes voting in favour of the Enforcement Instruction, if
any.

(c) Any enforcement of the Transaction Security will be undertaken by the Security Agent, subject to, and in
accordance with, the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**13.** **NOTEHOLDER ACTION**
(a) Subject to Condition 12 (Enforcement of Security) above and paragraphs (b) and (c) below, no Noteholder or
Couponholder shall be entitled to take any proceedings or other action directly against the Issuer or to enforce
the Transaction Security, including:

(i) directing the Trustee to give a Request Instruction or Enforcement Instruction;

(ii) taking or joining any person in taking steps against the Issuer or to enforce the Transaction Security for
the purpose of obtaining payment of any amount due from the Issuer to it; and

86


-----

(iii) initiating or joining any person in initiating any Insolvency Proceedings in relation to the Issuer or the
appointment of an Insolvency Official in relation to the Issuer or in relation to the whole or any part of the
undertakings or assets of the Issuer.

(b) If the Trustee having become bound to give a Note Acceleration Notice to the Issuer fails to do so and that
failure is continuing, the holders of not less than 25 per cent. in aggregate of the principal amount of the Notes
outstanding may, as applicable, sign and give a Note Acceleration Notice to the Issuer in accordance with
Condition 11 (Events of Default).

(c) If the Trustee having become bound to give a Request Instruction to the Security Agent fails to do so and that
failure is continuing, the holders of not less than 25 per cent. in aggregate of the principal amount of the Notes
outstanding may, as applicable, give a Request Instruction in writing directly to the Security Agent.

(d) If the Trustee having become bound to inform the Issuer and the Security Agent of the aggregate principal
amount of Notes represented by the holders of Notes voting in favour of an Enforcement Instruction fails to do
so and that failure is continuing, the Noteholders may provide their Noteholder Direction in writing in relation to
the taking of enforcement action in relation to the Transaction Security pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement
directly to the Security Agent.

**14.** **SUBSTITUTION**
The Trustee may, without the consent of the Noteholders or Couponholders, agree with the Issuer to the substitution in
place of the Issuer (or of any previous substitute under this Condition) as the principal debtor under the Notes, the
Coupons and the Trust Deed, of any Subsidiary of the Issuer, any successor in business of the Issuer or any Holding
Company of the Issuer, as more fully set forth in the Trust Deed, subject to (i) the Trustee being satisfied that the
interests of the Noteholders will not be materially prejudiced by the substitution, and (ii) certain other conditions set out
in the Trust Deed being complied with. As more fully set forth in the Trust Deed (and subject to the conditions and
qualifications therein), the Trustee may, without the consent of the Noteholders, also agree with the Issuer as to the
substitution of another corporation in place of the Issuer as principal debtor under the Notes, the Coupons and the Trust
Deed.

**15.** **REPLACEMENT OF NOTES AND COUPONS**
If any Note or Coupon is lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed it may be replaced at the specified office of the
Principal Paying Agent in London, subject to all applicable laws and stock exchange requirements, upon payment by
the claimant of the expenses incurred in connection with such replacement and on such terms as to evidence, security,
indemnity and otherwise as the Issuer may require (provided that the requirement is reasonable in the light of prevailing
market practice). Mutilated or defaced Notes or Coupons must be surrendered before replacements will be issued.

**16.** **MEETINGS OF NOTEHOLDERS, MODIFICATION, WAIVER AND AUTHORISATION**
(a) The Trust Deed contains provisions for convening meetings of the Noteholders to consider any matter affecting
their interests, including the modification by Extraordinary Resolution of any of these Conditions or any of the
provisions of the Trust Deed, the Notes, the Coupons, the Agency Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or the
Transaction Security Documents. Such a meeting may be convened by the Issuer or the Trustee and shall be
convened by the Issuer at the request of Noteholders holding not less than ten per cent. in principal amount of the
Notes for the time being remaining outstanding. The quorum at any meeting for passing an Extraordinary
Resolution will be one or more persons present holding or representing a clear majority in principal amount of
the Notes for the time being outstanding, or at any adjourned meeting one or more persons present whatever the
principal amount of the Notes held or represented by him or them, except that at any meeting, the business of
which includes the modification of certain of these Conditions and certain of the provisions of the Trust Deed,
the necessary quorum for passing an Extraordinary Resolution will be one or more persons present holding or
representing not less than two-thirds, or at any adjourned such meeting not less than one-third, of the principal
amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding. The matters (the “Basic Terms Modifications”) that require
such a quorum are:

(i) changing any date fixed for payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest in respect of the Notes,
reducing or cancelling the amount of principal, premium (if any) or interest payable on any date in respect
of the Notes, altering the method of calculating the amount of any payment in respect of the Notes on
redemption, maturity or following the occurrence of a Change of Control or altering the method of
calculating the date for any such payment;

(ii) alteration of the currency in which payments under the Notes and Coupons are to be made;

(iii) impairing the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or after the stated maturity
thereof (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the redemption date);

87


-----

(iv) except as provided under Condition 4.6 (Negative Pledge), Condition 5 (The Intercreditor Agreement) or
paragraph (c) of this Condition, make any change to any Intercreditor Agreement (or any amended
Intercreditor Agreement or replacement thereof) or any provisions of the Trust Deed affecting the ranking
of the Notes and the ranking of the payment obligations under the Notes, in each case in a manner that
adversely affects the rights of the Noteholders or directly or indirectly releases the Transaction Security
under the Transaction Security Documents, except as permitted by these Conditions, the Trust Deed, any
Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction Security Documents;

(v) alteration of the quorum or majority required to pass an Extraordinary Resolution; and

(vi) alteration of (A) the definition of “Basic Terms Modifications” or (B) the quorum requirements for any
meeting convened to vote on any Basic Terms Modifications.

An Extraordinary Resolution passed at any meeting of the Noteholders will be binding on all Noteholders,
whether or not they are present at the meeting, and on all Couponholders.

The Trust Deed provides that (i) a resolution passed at a meeting duly convened and held in accordance with the
Trust Deed by a majority consisting of not less than three quarters of the votes cast on such a resolution, (ii) a
resolution in writing signed by or on behalf of the holders of not less than three-quarters in principal amount of
the Notes for the time being outstanding or (iii) consents given by way of electronic consents through the
relevant clearing system(s) (in a form satisfactory to the Trustee) by or on behalf of the holder(s) of not less than
three quarters in principal amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding, shall, in each case, be effective as
an Extraordinary Resolution. Such a resolution in writing may be contained in one document or several
documents in the same form, each signed by or on behalf of one or more Noteholders.

(b) The Trustee may (in the case of paragraphs (i)(A), (i)(B) and (ii)) and shall (in the case of paragraph (i)(C))
agree, without the consent of the Noteholders or Couponholders:

(i) (A) to any modification of, or to the waiver or authorisation of any breach or proposed breach of, any
of these Conditions or any of the provisions of the Trust Deed, the Notes, the Coupons, the
Agency Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Transaction Security Documents (save to
the extent such modification, waiver or authorisation relates to any Basic Terms Modification)
which is not, in the opinion of the Trustee, materially prejudicial to the interests of the
Noteholders; or

(B) to any modification which is of a formal, minor or technical nature or to correct a manifest error or
an error which, in the opinion of the Trustee, is proven; or

(C) to any modification which is requested by the Issuer in order to allow the Issuer to comply with
any requirements which apply to it under EMIR subject to the Trustee receiving a certificate from
the Issuer certifying to the Trustee that the amendments are to be made solely for the purpose of
enabling the Issuer to satisfy its requirements under EMIR, unless the Trustee is of the opinion that
such modification would have the effect of exposing the Trustee to any liability against which it
has not been indemnified and/or secured and/or pre-funded to its satisfaction or the effect of
increasing the obligations or duties or decreasing the protections of the Trustee in any of these
Conditions or any of the provisions of the Trust Deed, the Notes, the Coupons, the Agency
Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Transaction Security Documents; or

(ii) to determine that any Event of Default or Default shall not be treated as such, subject to instructions to the
contrary from the Noteholders in the form of an Extraordinary Resolution (as further provided in the
Trust Deed).

(c) The Trust Deed also provides that at the request and expense of the Issuer and without the consent of the
Noteholders:

(i) at the time of, or prior to, the incurrence of any Financial Indebtedness that is permitted to share the
Transaction Security, the Issuer, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into an additional
intercreditor agreement on terms substantially similar to the Intercreditor Agreement or an amendment to
the Intercreditor Agreement to (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of the
Intercreditor Agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Financial Indebtedness covered by any such
agreement that may be incurred by the Issuer that is subject to any such agreement (provided that such
Financial Indebtedness is incurred in compliance with these Conditions and the terms of the Trust Deed),
(3) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (4) make provision for equal and rateable
pledges of the Transaction Security to secure Additional Notes or to implement any Security permitted
under these Conditions or the Intercreditor Agreement or (5) make any other change to any such
agreement that is not in the opinion of the Trustee materially prejudicial to the interests of the

88


-----

Noteholders; provided that any amendment to the Intercreditor Agreement will not impose or extend any
personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities,
protections or immunities of the Trustee and/or the Security Agent under these Conditions, the Trust
Deed, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Document; and

(ii) the Trustee and the Security Agent may from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the
Transaction Security Documents to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein or
reflect changes of a minor, technical or administrative nature, (2) provide for any Security permitted
under these Conditions, (3) add to the Transaction Security or (4) make any other change thereto that is
not, in the opinion of the Trustee, materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders.

(d) Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, in connection with the exercise by it of any of its trusts, powers or
discretions (including, without limitation, any modification, waiver, authorisation, determination or substitution),
the Trustee shall have regard to the general interests of the Noteholders as a class but shall not have regard to any
interests arising from circumstances particular to individual Noteholders or Couponholders (whatever their
number) and, in particular but without limitation, shall not have regard to the consequences of the exercise of its
trusts, powers or discretions for individual Noteholders or Couponholders (whatever their number) resulting
from their being for any purpose domiciled or resident in, or otherwise connected with, or subject to the
jurisdiction of, any particular territory and the Trustee shall not be entitled to require, nor shall any Noteholder or
Couponholder be entitled to claim, from the Issuer or any other person any indemnification or payment in
respect of any tax consequence of any such exercise upon individual Noteholders or Couponholders except to the
extent already provided for in Condition 10 (Taxation) and/or any undertaking given in addition to, or in
substitution for, Condition 10 (Taxation) pursuant to the Trust Deed.

(e) Any modification, waiver, authorisation, determination or substitution shall be binding on the Noteholders and
the Couponholders, and any modification, unless the Trustee agrees otherwise, or substitution shall be notified
by the Issuer to the Noteholders as soon as practicable thereafter in accordance with Condition 20 (Notices).

**17.** **THE TRUSTEE**
The Trust Deed contains provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee and for its relief from responsibility,
including provisions relieving it from taking action unless indemnified and/or secured and/or pre-funded to its
satisfaction.

Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee may at any time, at its discretion and without notice,
take such proceedings against the Issuer or the Parent as it may think fit to enforce the provisions of these Conditions,
the Trust Deed, the Notes, the Coupons, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Transaction Security Documents (as
applicable), but it shall not be bound to take any such proceedings or any other action in relation to the Trust Deed, the
Notes, the Coupons, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Transaction Security Documents unless (i) it shall have been so
directed by an Extraordinary Resolution of the Noteholders or so requested in writing by the holders of at least 25 per
cent. in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding and shall not have received any contrary direction by an
Extraordinary Resolution of the Noteholders or in writing by the holders of at least 50 per cent. in principal amount of
the Notes then outstanding, and (ii) it shall have been indemnified and/or secured and/or pre-funded to its satisfaction.

The Trustee may rely on any certificate or report of the Issuer's auditors or any other person called for by or provided to
the Trustee (whether or not addressed to the Trustee) in accordance with or for the purposes of the Trust Deed, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Transaction Security Documents notwithstanding that such certificate or report and/or
any engagement letter or other document entered into by the Trustee in connection therewith contains a monetary or
other limit on the liability of the auditors of the Issuer or such other person in respect thereof.

The Trust Deed also contains provisions pursuant to which the Trustee is entitled, inter alia, (a) to enter into business
transactions with the Parent and/or the Parent's other Subsidiaries (including the Issuer) and to act as trustee for the
holders of any other securities issued or guaranteed by, or relating to, the Parent and/or any of the Parent's other
Subsidiaries, (b) to exercise and enforce its rights, comply with its obligations and perform its duties under or in relation
to any such transactions or, as the case may be, any such trusteeship without regard to the interests of, or consequences
for, the Noteholders or Couponholders, and (c) to retain and not be liable to account for any profit made or any other
amount or benefit received thereby or in connection therewith.

The Trustee shall not be required to review or check any accounts or other information provided to it by the Issuer
pursuant to the Trust Deed and shall have no liability to any person as a result of any failure to do so.

**18.** **NO PERSONAL LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND SHAREHOLDERS**
No director, officer, employee, incorporator, member or shareholder of the Issuer will have any liability for any
obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Coupons or the Trust Deed or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by
reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Noteholder by accepting a Note and each Couponholder by accepting

89


-----

a coupon waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the
Notes. Such waiver and release may not be effective to waive liabilities under the US federal securities laws.

**PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE NOTES WHILE REPRESENTED BY THE GLOBAL NOTES**

The following is an overview of the provisions to be contained in the Trust Deed to constitute the Notes and in the
Global Notes which will apply to, and in some cases modify, the Terms and Conditions of the Notes while the Notes are
represented by the Global Notes.

**1.** **Exchange**

The Permanent Global Note will be exchangeable in whole but not in part (free of charge to the holder) for definitive
Notes only:

(a) upon the happening of any of the events defined in the Terms and Conditions of the Notes (“Conditions”) as
“Events of Default”;

(b) if either Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg is closed for business for a continuous period of 14 days (other
than by reason of holiday, statutory or otherwise) or announces an intention permanently to cease business or
does in fact do so and no alternative clearing system satisfactory to the Trustee is available; or

(c) if the Issuer would suffer a disadvantage as a result of a change in laws or regulations (taxation or otherwise) or
as a result of a change in the practice of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg which would not be suffered
were the Notes in definitive form and a certificate to such effect signed by two Directors of the Issuer is given to
the Trustee.

Thereupon (in the case of (a) and (b) above) the holder of the Permanent Global Note (acting on the instructions of one
or more of the Accountholders (as defined below)) or the Trustee may give notice to the Issuer and (in the case of (c)
above) the Issuer may give notice to the Trustee and the Noteholders, of its intention to exchange the Permanent Global
Note for definitive Notes on or after the Exchange Date (as defined below).

On or after the Exchange Date the holder of the Permanent Global Note may or, in the case of (c) above, shall surrender
the Permanent Global Note to or to the order of the Principal Paying Agent. In exchange for the Permanent Global Note
the Issuer will deliver, or procure the delivery of, an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Notes (having
attached to them all Coupons in respect of interest which has not already been paid on the Permanent Global Note),
security printed in accordance with any applicable legal and stock exchange requirements and in or substantially in the
form set out in the Trust Deed. On exchange of the Permanent Global Note, the Issuer will procure that it is cancelled
and, if the holder so requests, returned to the holder together with any relevant definitive Notes.

For these purposes, “Exchange Date” means a day specified in the notice requiring exchange falling not less than 60
days after that on which such notice is given and being a day on which banks are open for general business in the place
in which the specified office of the Principal Paying Agent is located and, except in the case of exchange pursuant to (b)
above, in the place in which the relevant clearing system is located.

**2.** **Payments**

No payment will be made on the Temporary Global Note unless exchange for an interest in the Permanent Global Note
is improperly withheld or refused. Payments of principal, premium and interest in respect of Notes represented by a
Global Note will, subject as set out below, be made to the bearer of such Global Note against presentation for
endorsement and, if no further payment falls to be made in respect of the Notes, against surrender of such Global Note
to the order of the Principal Paying Agent or such other Paying Agent as shall have been notified to the Noteholders for
such purposes. A record of each payment made will be endorsed on the appropriate part of the schedule to the relevant
Global Note by or on behalf of the Principal Paying Agent, which endorsement shall be prima facie evidence that such
payment has been made in respect of the Notes. Payments of interest on the Temporary Global Note (if permitted by the
first sentence of this paragraph) will be made only upon certification as to non-U.S. beneficial ownership unless such
certification has already been made.

**3.** **Notices**

For so long as all of the Notes are represented by one or both of the Global Notes and such Global Note(s) is/are held on
behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, notices to Noteholders (including any notices to be delivered to
the Noteholders pursuant to Condition 12 (Enforcement of Security)) may be given by delivery of the relevant notice to
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg (as the case may be) for communication to the relative Accountholders
rather than by publication as required by Condition 20 (Notices). Any such notice shall be deemed to have been given to
the Noteholders on the second day after the day on which such notice is delivered to Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
Luxembourg (as the case may be) as aforesaid.

101


-----

Whilst any of the Notes held by a Noteholder are represented by a Global Note, notices to be given by such Noteholder
(including any Noteholder Direction pursuant to Condition 12 (Enforcement of Security)) may be given by such
Noteholder (where applicable) through Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg and otherwise in such manner as the
Principal Paying Agent and Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg may approve for this purpose.

**4.** **Accountholders**

For so long as all of the Notes are represented by one or both of the Global Notes and such Global Note(s) is/are held on
behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, each person (other than Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg)
who is for the time being shown in the records of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg as the holder of a particular
principal amount of such Notes (each an “Accountholder”) (in which regard any certificate or other document issued
by Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg as to the principal amount of such Notes standing to the account of any
person shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding for all purposes) shall be treated as the holder
of such principal amount of such Notes for all purposes (including but not limited to, for the purposes of any quorum
requirements of, or the right to demand a poll at, meetings of the Noteholders and giving notice to the Issuer or, as the
case may be, the Trustee pursuant to Condition 11 (Events of Default), Condition 12 (Enforcement of Security) and
Condition 7.3 (Purchase of Notes Upon a Change of Control)) other than with respect to the payment of principal,
premium and interest on such principal amount of such Notes, the right to which shall be vested, as against the Issuer
and the Trustee, solely in the bearer of the relevant Global Note in accordance with and subject to its terms and the
terms of the Trust Deed. Each Accountholder must look solely to Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case
may be, for its share of each payment made to the bearer of the relevant Global Note.

**5.** **Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer in respect of principal, premium and interest on the Notes represented by a Global Note will
be prescribed after ten years from the appropriate payment date (in the case of principal and premium) and five years
from the relevant Interest Payment Date (in the case of interest).

**6.** **Cancellation**

Cancellation of any Note represented by a Global Note and required by the Conditions of the Notes to be cancelled
following its redemption or purchase will be effected by endorsement by or on behalf of the Principal Paying Agent of
the reduction in the principal amount of the relevant Global Note on the relevant part of the schedule thereto.

**7.** **Put Option**

For so long as all of the Notes are represented by one or both of the Global Notes and such Global Note(s) is/are held on
behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, the option of the Noteholders provided for in Condition 7.3
(Purchase of Notes Upon a Change of Control) may be exercised by an Accountholder giving notice to the Principal
Paying Agent in accordance with the standard procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg (which may
include notice being given on his instructions by Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg or any common depositary for
them to the Principal Paying Agent by electronic means) of the principal amount of the Notes in respect of which such
option is exercised and at the same time presenting or procuring the presentation of the relevant Global Note to the
Principal Paying Agent for notation accordingly within the time limits set forth in that Condition.

**8.** **Redemption at the Option of the Issuer**

For so long as all of the Notes are represented by one or both of the Global Notes and such Global Note(s) is/are held on
behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, in the event that the Issuer exercises its call option pursuant to
Condition 7.2(a) (Optional Redemption) in respect of less than the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding
at such time, the Notes shall be redeemed on a pro rata basis or, if redemption on a pro rata basis is not permitted by
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg at such time, the standard procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
Luxembourg shall operate to determine which interests in the Global Note(s) are to be subject to such option.

**9.** **Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg**

References in the Global Notes and this summary to Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg shall be deemed to
include references to any other clearing system approved by the Trustee.

**10.** **Payment Business Day**

_Business Day: Notwithstanding the definition of “Business Day” in Condition 21 (Definitions), while any Bonds are_
represented by a Global Bond or a Global Bond Certificate and such Global Bond or Global Bond Certificate is held on
behalf of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg and/or any other relevant Clearing System, “Business Day” and
“business day” shall mean any day which is a day on which dealings in foreign currencies may be carried on in
London.

**TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**UNITED KINGDOM TAXATION**
**The following is a general description of certain UK taxation considerations in relation to the Notes based on**
**current law and published practice in the UK as at the date of this Prospectus. It does not purport to be a**
**complete analysis of all tax considerations relating to the Notes. The comments relate only to the position of**
**persons who are absolute beneficial owners of the Notes and some aspects do not apply to certain classes of**
**taxpayer (such as dealers, trustees and Noteholders who are connected or associated with the Issuer for relevant**
**tax purposes). The summary set out below is a general guide and should be treated with appropriate caution.**
**Prospective purchasers who are in any doubt as to their tax position or who may be subject to tax in a**
**jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom should consult their professional advisors. In particular, holders of**
**the Notes should be aware that they may be liable to taxation under the laws of other jurisdictions in relation to**
**payments in respect of the Notes even if such payments may be made without withholding or deduction for or on**
**account of taxation under the laws of the UK.**

**UK Withholding Tax on UK source interest**

The Notes issued by the Issuer will constitute “quoted Eurobonds” within the meaning of section 987 of the Income Tax
Act 2007 provided they are and continue to be listed on a recognised stock exchange within the meaning of section
1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The London Stock Exchange has been designated as a recognised stock exchange for
these purposes. The Notes will be treated as listed on the London Stock Exchange if they are admitted to the Official
List of the UK Listing Authority and are admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange.

Interest on the Notes may also be paid without withholding or deduction for or on account of UK income tax where
interest on the Notes is paid by a company and, at the time the payment is made, the Issuer (and any person by or
through whom interest on the Notes is paid) reasonably believes that the beneficial owner is within the charge to UK
corporation tax as regards the payment of interest or the payment is made to one of the classes of exempt bodies or
persons set out in sections 935 to 937 of the Income Tax Act 2007, provided that HM Revenue & Customs has not
given a direction that the interest should be paid under deduction of tax.

In cases falling outside the exemptions described above, an amount must generally be withheld from payments of
interest on the Notes that has a United Kingdom source on account of UK income tax at the basic rate (currently 20 per
cent.) subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty.

**Further United Kingdom Income Tax issues**

Interest on the Notes that constitutes UK source income for tax purposes may, as such, be subject to income tax by
direct assessment even where paid without withholding. However, interest with a UK source received without deduction
or withholding on account of UK tax will generally not be chargeable to UK tax in the hands of a Noteholder who is not
resident for tax purposes in the UK unless that Noteholder carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the UK through a
UK branch or agency or, for holders who are companies, through a UK permanent establishment, in connection with
which the interest is received or to which the Notes are attributable. There are exemptions for interest received by
certain categories of agent (such as some brokers and investment managers).

The attention of Noteholders is drawn to Condition 10 (Taxation) of the Notes. The provisions relating to additional
payments referred to in Condition 10 (Taxation) of the Notes would not apply if HM Revenue & Customs sought to
assess the person entitled to the relevant interest or (where applicable) profit on any Note directly to UK income tax.
However, exemption from or reduction of such UK tax liability might be available under an applicable double taxation
treaty.

The above description of the UK withholding tax position assumes that there will be no substitution of the Issuer
pursuant to Condition 14 (Substitution) of the Notes and does not consider the tax consequences of any such
substitution.

The references to “interest” above mean “interest” as understood in UK tax law. The statements above do not take any
account of any different definitions of “interest” or “principal” which may prevail under any other law or which may be
created by the terms and conditions of the Notes or any related documentation.

**United Kingdom Corporation Tax Payers**

In general Noteholders which are within the charge to UK corporation tax (other than investment trusts, venture capital
trusts, authorised unit trusts and open ended investment companies) will be treated for tax purposes as realising profits,
gains or losses (including exchange gains and losses) in respect of the Notes on a basis which is broadly in accordance
with their statutory accounting treatment so long as the accounting treatment is in accordance with generally accepted
accounting practice as that term is defined for tax purposes. Such profits, gains and losses (or where the Noteholder's

103


-----

functional currency is not sterling, then the sterling equivalent of such profits, gains and losses as computed in the
Noteholder's functional currency) will be taken into account in computing taxable income for corporation tax purposes.

**Other UK Tax Payers**

**_Taxation of Chargeable Gains_**

The Notes may constitute “qualifying corporate bonds” within the meaning of section 117 of the Taxation of
Chargeable Gains Act 1992, provided that interest payable in respect of the Notes represents a reasonable commercial
return on the Issue Price of the Notes. If the Notes are “qualifying corporate bonds”, a disposal by a Noteholder will not
give rise to a chargeable gain or an allowable loss for the purposes of the UK taxation of chargeable gains. If the Notes
are not “qualifying corporate bonds” a disposal may give rise to a chargeable gain or an allowable loss, and prospective
Noteholders are advised to seek their own professional advice.

If the Notes are deeply discounted securities within Chapter 8 of Part 4 of the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income)
Act 2005, they will constitute “qualifying corporate bonds”.

**_Accrued Income Scheme_**

The provisions of the accrued income scheme (the “Scheme”) may apply to certain Noteholders who are not subject to
corporation tax, in relation to a transfer of the Notes.

On a transfer of securities with accrued interest the Scheme usually applies to deem the transferor to receive an amount
of income equal to the accrued interest and to treat the deemed or actual interest subsequently received by the transferee
as reduced by a corresponding amount.

Broadly, where the Notes are issued with accrued interest for which the Noteholder has paid an additional sum as part
of the Issue Price, the interest subsequently received by the Noteholder, will, for the purposes of the Scheme, be deemed
to be reduced by an amount corresponding to such additional sum.

Generally, persons who are not resident in the UK and who do not carry on a trade in the UK through a branch or
agency to which the Notes are attributable will not be subject to the provisions of these rules.

The Scheme will not apply in relation to Notes which constitute deeply discounted securities as defined in Chapter 8 of
Part 4 of the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005.

**Stamp Duty and SDRT**

It is expected that no stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax will be payable on issue of the Notes or on a transfer of
Notes.

**The Proposed Financial Transactions Tax** **(“FTT”)**

On 14 February 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission’s Proposal”) for a Directive
for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and
Slovakia (the “participating Member States”). However, Estonia has since stated that it will not participate.

The Commission’s Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the Notes
(including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances.

Under the Commission’s Proposal the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of
the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a
financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A financial institution may be,
or be deemed to be, "established" in a participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by
transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is
subject to the dealings is issued in a participating Member State.

However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between participating Member States. It may therefore be
altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU Member States may decide to
participate.

Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

agreed to subscribe the Notes at the issue price of 100 per cent. of the principal amount of Notes, less a combined

**United States**

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the
United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except in accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to
any other exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

The Notes are subject to U.S. tax law requirements and may not be offered, sold or delivered within the United States or
its possessions or to a United States person, except in certain transactions permitted by U.S. tax regulations. Terms used
in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and regulations
thereunder.

Each Manager has agreed that, except as permitted by the Subscription Agreement, it will not offer, sell or deliver the
Notes (a) as part of their distribution at any time or (b) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of

will have sent to each dealer to which it sells any Notes during the distribution compliance period a confirmation or
other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes within the United States or to, or for the

under the Securities Act.

In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the offering, an offer or sale of Notes within the United States by
any dealer that is not participating in the offering may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

**United Kingdom**

Each Manager has represented and agreed that:

(A) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of
the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which Section
21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer; and

(B) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it
in relation to any Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

**General**

No action has been taken by the Issuer or any of the Managers that would, or is intended to, permit a public offer of the
Notes in any country or jurisdiction where any such action for that purpose is required. Accordingly, each Manager has
undertaken that it will not, directly or indirectly, offer or sell any Notes or distribute or publish any offering circular,
prospectus, form of application, advertisement or other document or information in any country or jurisdiction except
under circumstances that will, to the best of its knowledge and belief, result in compliance with any applicable laws and
regulations and all offers and sales of Notes by it will be made on the same terms.

**Interest of persons involved in the offer of Notes**

Except as described in this “Subscription and Sale” section, so far as the Issuer is aware, no person involved in the offer
of the Notes has an interest material to the offer, other than certain of the Managers acting as lenders under the Issuer
Facilities.
