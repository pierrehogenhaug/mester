distribution of such Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. The target market and
distribution channel(s) may vary in relation to sales outside the EEA in light of local regulatory regimes in force in
the relevant jurisdiction. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such Notes (a “distributor”)
should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID
II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such Notes (by either adopting or
refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**SUBJECT TO COMPLETION, DATED 22 OCTOBER 2019**


**CONFIDENTIAL** **NOT FOR GENERAL CIRCULATION**
**PRELIMINARY OFFERING CIRCULAR** **IN THE UNITED STATES OR TO U.S. PERSONS**

**€400,000,000** **% Vendor Financing Notes due 2024**
**issued by**
**VZ Vendor Financing B.V.**


VZ Vendor Financing B.V., a company incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands with registered number 76130592 (the “Issuer”), is offering an
aggregate principal amount of €400,000,000 % vendor financing notes due 2024 (the “ Notes”) on or about 2019 (the “Issue Date”). The Notes will
bear interest at the rate per annum equal to % as described herein. The Notes will mature on 31 January 2024 (the “Maturity Date”). Interest on the Notes will
be payable semi-annually in arrear on 15 April and 15 October of each year, commencing on 15 April 2020, subject to adjustment for non-business days (each, an
“Interest Payment Date”).
On or following the Issue Date, the net proceeds of the issuance of the Notes plus any upfront payments payable by VZ Financing I B.V. (the “New VFZ
**Facilities Borrower”) under the New VFZ Facilities Agreement (as defined herein), will be used by the Issuer to finance the purchase of VFZ Accounts Receivable**
(as defined herein) pursuant to the Framework Assignment Agreement (as defined herein). It is expected that the Issuer will complete its initial purchases of new and
existing VFZ Accounts Receivable by 31 March 2020. To the extent that there are not sufficient VFZ Accounts Receivable available for purchase on the first Value
Date (as defined herein) falling on or after the Issue Date, the Issuer will advance any excess proceeds from the issuance of the Notes to the New VFZ Facilities
Borrower, as the borrower under the New VFZ Facilities Agreement, as Excess Cash Loans (as defined herein) under the Excess Cash Facility (as defined herein)
pursuant to the New VFZ Facilities Agreement. On the Issue Date, the Issuer will also fund the Subscription Proceeds (as defined herein) under the Issue Date
Facility (as defined herein) to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower, pursuant to the New VFZ Facilities Agreement.
The Notes will be subject to tax redemption and illegality redemption. Additionally, the Notes may be redeemed at any time prior to 2020, at a price
equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date and a “make-whole” premium as further described in Condition
6(d) (“Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation; Approved Exchange Offer—Early Make-Whole Redemption Event”). The Notes may also be redeemed at any time on
or after 2020, at the redemption prices described in Condition 6(e) (“Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation; Approved Exchange Offer—Early Redemption
_Event on or after_ _2020”), plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Each of the foregoing redemptions are subject to the relevant provisions of_
Condition 6 (“Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation; Approved Exchange Offer”) under “Terms and Conditions of the Notes”.
On or prior to 30 days after the Issue Date and following the determination of VodafoneZiggo (as defined herein) that the Issuer is required to be consolidated
into the financial statements of the Group (as defined herein), the Issuer may redeem all, but not some, of the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date as further described in Condition 6(f) (“Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation;
_Approved Exchange Offer—Early Redemption Event”)._
Following a change of control as defined under the New VFZ Facilities Agreement, the New VFZ Facilities Borrower will be required to offer to prepay the New
VFZ Facilities Loans (as defined herein). Following receipt of such prepayment offer, the Issuer will launch a consent solicitation to set (i) the Maturity Date of the Notes
as the New Maturity Date (as defined herein) and (ii) the redemption price of the Notes on the New Maturity Date at 101% of the principal amount of the Notes
(“Accelerated Redemption Price”), plus accrued and unpaid interest to the New Maturity Date, in accordance with the relevant provisions of Condition 6 (“Redemption,
_Purchase and Cancellation; Approved Exchange Offer”). If holders of more than 50% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes consent to the foregoing requests, the_
Issuer will inform the New VFZ Facilities Borrower that it accepts the prepayment offer, and the New VFZ Facilities Borrower will prepay the New VFZ Facilities Loans
at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, together with a payment equal to 1% of the principal amount of the Excess Cash Loans and Interest Facility Loans so
prepaid. Following such prepayment, the Issuer will redeem all of the Notes on the New Maturity Date at the Accelerated Redemption Price, plus accrued and unpaid
interest to the New Maturity Date. Additionally, the Notes may be redeemed prior to the Maturity Date in connection with an Approved Exchange Offer (as defined
herein). See Conditions 6(k) and 6(l) (“Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation; Approved Exchange Offer—Approved Exchange Offer”).
The Issuer is dependent upon payments it receives in respect of the Assigned Receivables (as defined herein) and under the Framework Assignment Agreement, the
New VFZ Facilities Agreement, the Expenses Agreement (as defined herein) and the related agreements to make payments on the Notes. The Issuer will apply payments
it receives in respect of the Assigned Receivables, the Framework Assignment Agreement, the New VFZ Facilities Agreement, the Expenses Agreement and such related
agreements, including in respect of principal and interest, to make payments on the Notes in accordance with Condition 7 (“Payments”). Payment of principal and
interest will be limited to the amount of funds available from time to time for that purpose in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed (as defined herein).
The Notes will be limited recourse and senior obligations of the Issuer. The Notes will be secured by the security granted over the following (collectively, the “Notes
**Collateral”): (i) the Issuer’s rights, title, benefit and interest in, to and under the Assigned Receivables; (ii) the Issuer’s rights under all contracts, agreements, deeds and**
documents to which it is or may become a party or in respect of which it has or may have any right, title, benefit or interest (including, without limitation, the New VFZ
Facilities Agreement, the Expenses Agreement, the Framework Assignment Agreement and the Issue Date Arrangements Agreement (as defined herein)); (iii) the Issuer
Transaction Accounts (as defined herein), and all amounts at any time standing to the credit thereto; and (iv) all other present and future property, assets and undertakings
of the Issuer, in favour of BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited (the “Security Trustee”) for the benefit of the Secured Parties (as defined herein) pursuant to
the Notes Security Documents (as defined herein). None of VodafoneZiggo Group B.V. (“VodafoneZiggo”) nor any of its subsidiaries will guarantee or provide any
security or any other credit support to the Issuer with respect to its obligations under the Notes. Other than under the limited circumstances described herein, Noteholders
(as defined herein) will not have a direct claim on the cash flow or assets of VodafoneZiggo or any of its subsidiaries, and neither VodafoneZiggo nor any of its
subsidiaries has any obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due under the Notes, or to make funds available to the Issuer for those payments, other than the
obligations of (i) the Obligors (as defined herein) to make payments to the Issuer in respect of the Assigned Receivables, (ii) the Obligors to make payments to the Issuer in
respect of the New VFZ Facilities Agreement or (iii) VZ Financing I B.V. to make payments to the Issuer under the Expenses Agreement, and in each case of (i) to
(iii) above, any agreements related thereto to which they are party.
Subject to certain conditions, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option and without the consent of the Noteholders, to issue further Notes (the “Further Notes”)
having the same terms and conditions (except as to issue date and initial interest paid in respect of their first interest period) as, and being fungible with, the Notes. The

respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties
and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all
channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any
person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or
refining the manufacturer target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

This Offering Circular has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in any Member State of the
European Economic Area (the “EEA”) will be made pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129
(the “Prospectus Regulation”) from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This Offering
Circular is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation. Accordingly, any person making or
intending to make any offer within the EEA of the Notes should only do so in circumstances in which no
obligation arises for the Issuer or any of the Initial Purchasers to produce a prospectus for such offer. None of the
Issuer, VodafoneZiggo or the Initial Purchasers has authorized, nor do any of them authorize, the making of any
offer of the Notes through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial Purchasers which
constitute the final placement of the Notes contemplated in this Offering Circular.

The Notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be transferred or resold except
as permitted under the U.S. Securities Act and all other applicable securities laws. See “Transfer Restrictions”.

The Issuer and VodafoneZiggo have prepared this Offering Circular solely for use in connection with this
offering and for applying to Euronext Dublin for the Notes to be listed on its Official List and for trading on its
Global Exchange Market. You may not distribute this Offering Circular or make copies of it without the Issuer’s
and VodafoneZiggo’s prior written consent other than to people you have retained to advise you in connection
with this offering.

You are not to construe the contents of this Offering Circular as investment, legal or tax advice. You should
consult your own counsel, accountant and other advisers as to legal, tax, business, financial and related aspects of
a purchase of the Notes. You are responsible for making your own examination of VodafoneZiggo and your own
assessment of the merits and risks of investing in the Notes. None of the Issuer, VodafoneZiggo or the Initial
Purchasers is making any representation to you regarding the legality of an investment in the Notes by you.

The information contained in this Offering Circular has been furnished by the Issuer and VodafoneZiggo
and other sources the Issuer and VodafoneZiggo believe to be reliable. No representation or warranty, express or
implied, is made by the Initial Purchasers as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the information set out in
this Offering Circular, and nothing contained in this Offering Circular is or shall be relied upon as a promise or
representation by the Initial Purchasers, whether as to the past or the future. This Offering Circular contains
summaries, believed to be accurate, of some of the terms of specified documents, but reference is made to the
actual documents, copies of which will be made available by the Issuer and VodafoneZiggo upon request, for the
complete information contained in those documents. Copies of such documents and other information relating to
the issuance of the Notes will also be available for inspection at the specified offices of the Issuer. All summaries
of the documents contained herein are qualified in their entirety by this reference.

The Issuer (except as noted in the following paragraph) and VodafoneZiggo accept responsibility for the
information contained in this Offering Circular, or incorporated by reference herein. VodafoneZiggo has made all
reasonable inquiries and confirmed to the best of its knowledge, information and belief that the information
contained in this Offering Circular, or incorporated by reference herein, with regard to VodafoneZiggo, each of
its subsidiaries and affiliates, and the Notes is true and accurate in all material respects, that the opinions and
intentions expressed in this Offering Circular are honestly held, and that it is not aware of any other facts the
omission of which would make this Offering Circular or any statement contained herein misleading in any
material respect.

The Issuer accepts responsibility for the information contained in this Offering Circular (except in relation
to the information in respect of VodafoneZiggo, each of its subsidiaries and affiliates, and industry, statistical and
market-related data included herein, for which VodafoneZiggo takes sole responsibility). To the best of the
knowledge and belief of the Issuer, the information contained in this Offering Circular for which it takes
responsibility is in accordance with the facts and does not omit anything likely to affect the import of such

VodafoneZiggo or the Initial Purchasers. The information contained in this Offering Circular is current at the

information set out in this Offering Circular or in either the Issuer’s or VodafoneZiggo’s affairs since the date of
this Offering Circular.

The Issuer reserves the right to withdraw this offering of Notes at any time, and the Issuer and the Initial
Purchasers reserve the right to reject any commitment to subscribe for the Notes in whole or in part and to allot
to you less than the full amount of Notes subscribed for by you.

The distribution of this Offering Circular and the offer and sale of the Notes may be restricted by law in
some jurisdictions. Persons into whose possession this Offering Circular or any of the Notes come must inform
themselves about, and observe any restrictions on the transfer and exchange of the Notes. See “Plan of
_Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions”._

This Offering Circular does not constitute an offer to sell or an invitation to subscribe for or purchase any of
the Notes in any jurisdiction in which such offer or invitation is not authorized or to any person to whom it is
unlawful to make such an offer or invitation. You must comply with all laws that apply to you in any place in
which you buy, offer or sell any Notes or possess this Offering Circular. You must also obtain any consents or
approvals that you need in order to purchase any Notes. None of the Issuer, VodafoneZiggo or the Initial

The Notes are subject to restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Plan of Distribution” and

representations and agreements as described in those sections of this Offering Circular.

If issued, the Notes will initially be available in book-entry form only. The Notes will be represented on

Clearstream (together, the “Clearing Systems” and each a “Clearing System”). Interests in the Global Notes
will be exchangeable for definitive notes only in certain limited circumstances. See “Book-Entry Clearance
_Procedures” and “Form of the Notes”._

**NOTICE TO U.S. INVESTORS**

Each purchaser of Notes will be deemed to have made the representations, warranties and
acknowledgements that are described in this Offering Circular under “Transfer Restrictions”. The Notes have not
been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any state of the United
States and are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be transferred or resold except as
permitted under the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws, pursuant to registration or an
exemption therefrom. Please refer to the section of this Offering Circular entitled “Transfer Restrictions”. The
Notes may not be offered to the public within any jurisdiction. By accepting delivery of this Offering Circular,
you agree not to offer, sell, resell, transfer or deliver, directly or indirectly, any note to the public.

**PROHIBITION OF OFFERS TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a
person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU
(as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (the “IDD”), where
that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or
(iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document
required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the
Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering
or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under
the PRIIPs Regulation. This Offering Circular has been prepared on the basis that any offer of notes in any
Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the
requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of notes. This Offering Circular is not a prospectus for the
purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

**PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS AND ECPS ONLY TARGET MARKET**

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of each manufacturer, the target market assessment
in respect of the Notes described in this Offering Circular has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for
such Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all
channels for distribution of such Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. The
target market and distribution channel(s) may vary in relation to sales outside the EEA in light of local regulatory
regimes in force in the relevant jurisdiction. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such
Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a
distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such
Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

**NOTICE TO EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA INVESTORS**

In relation to each member state of the EEA (each, a “Member State”), each Initial Purchaser has
represented and agreed that it has not made and will not make an offer of Notes which are the subject of the
offering contemplated by this Offering Circular to the public in that Member State other than:

(a) to any legal entity which is a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation;

(b) to fewer than 150 natural or legal persons (other than qualified investors as defined in the Prospectus
Regulation), as permitted under the Prospectus Regulation, subject to obtaining the prior consent of the
relevant Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers nominated by the Issuer for any such offer; or

(c) in any other circumstances falling within Article 1(4) of the Prospectus Regulation; provided that no
such offer of the Notes shall require the publication by the Issuer or any Initial Purchaser of a
prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Regulation or supplement a prospectus pursuant to
Article 23 of the Prospectus Regulation. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any
offer within the EEA of the Notes should only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for
the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus, pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus
Regulation or supplement a prospectus pursuant to Article 23 of the Prospectus Regulation, in each
case, in relation to such offer. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do the

v


-----

Issuer or any Initial Purchaser authorize, the making of any offer of Notes through any financial
intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial Purchasers, which constitute the final placement of
the Notes contemplated in this Offering Circular.

For the purposes of this provision, the expression an “offer of notes to the public” in relation to any Notes in
any Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the
terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe the
Notes and the expression “Prospectus Regulation” means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 and includes any relevant
implementing measure in any Member State.

Each subscriber for or purchaser of the Notes in the offering located within a Member State will be deemed
to have represented, acknowledged and agreed that it is a “qualified investor” within the meaning of the
Prospectus Regulation. The Issuer, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates, and others will rely upon the trust
and accuracy of the foregoing representation, acknowledgement and agreement. Notwithstanding the above, a
person who is not a qualified investor and who has notified the Initial Purchasers of such fact in writing may,
with the consent of the Initial Purchasers, be permitted to subscribe for or purchase the Notes in the offering.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**The Issuer’s Financial Information**

As of the date of this Offering Circular, no financial statements of the Issuer are available. Financial
statements will be published by the Issuer on an annual basis beginning with the year ending 31 December 2019,
and the Issuer will not prepare interim financial statements. The Group believes that VodafoneZiggo has no
variable interest in the Issuer and no ability to control the Issuer, and therefore VodafoneZiggo will not
consolidate the Issuer. See “Risk Factors—General Risks—VodafoneZiggo may be required to consolidate the
_Issuer into its consolidated financial statements and the Notes may be redeemed on or before 30 days after the_
_Issue Date”._

**VodafoneZiggo’s Financial Information**

This Offering Circular includes historical financial data from the 2019 Financial Statements and from the
31 December 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the 2018 Annual Report. Unless otherwise
indicated, the historical consolidated financial information presented herein of VodafoneZiggo and its
subsidiaries has been prepared in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
(“U.S. GAAP”). As described in Note 2 to the 31 December 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements contained
in the 2018 Annual Report, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with
_Customers (“ASU 2014-09”) on 1 January 2018 using the cumulative effect transition method. As such, the_
financial information included in the 2018 Annual Report as of and for 31 December 2017 has not been restated
and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for such years.

As described in Note 2 to the 30 June 2019 unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we
adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases (“ASU 2016-02”), which, for most leases,
results in lessees recognizing right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. ASU 201602, as amended by ASU No. 2018-11, Targeted Improvements, requires lessees and lessors to recognize and
measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using one of two modified retrospective
approaches. A number of optional practical expedients may be applied in transition. We adopted ASU 2016-02
on 1 January 2019. The main impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 relates to the recognition of ROU assets
and lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under
previous U.S. GAAP. We have applied the practical expedients that permit us not to reassess (i) whether expired
or existing contracts contain a lease under the new standard, (ii) the lease classification for expired or existing
leases or (iii) whether previously capitalized initial direct costs would qualify for capitalization under the new
standard. In addition, we have not used hindsight during transition.

The historical consolidated results of VodafoneZiggo are not necessarily indicative of the consolidated
results that may be expected for any future period.

VodafoneZiggo’s consolidated financial results are reported in euro. Unless otherwise indicated,
convenience translations into euro have been calculated at the 30 June 2019 market rate.

_Pro Forma Financial Information_

In our “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included
in the 2018 Annual Report, in our discussion and analysis of our results of operations for 2018, as compared to
2017, we present our revenue, expenses, and operating cash flow (“OCF”), for 2017 on a pro forma basis, giving
effect to the adoption of ASU 2014-09 as if such adoption had occurred on 1 January 2017. However, in the
discussion and analysis of our results of operations for 2017, as compared to 2016, included in the 2018 Annual
Report, we present all amounts for 2017 on a historical basis and all amounts for 2016 on a pro forma basis as if
the JV Transaction (as discussed in the 2018 Annual Report) had been completed on 1 January 2016.

**Other Financial Measures**

In this Offering Circular, we present OCF, which is not required by, or presented in accordance with U.S.
GAAP. OCF is the primary measure used by our management to evaluate the operating performance of our
businesses. OCF is also a key factor that is used by our management and our supervisory board to evaluate the
effectiveness of our management for purposes of annual and other incentive compensation plans. As we use the
term, OCF is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation,
provisions and provision releases related to significant litigation and impairment, restructuring and other
operating items. Other operating items include (i) gains and losses on the disposition of long-lived assets,
(ii) third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions, including

xxiii


-----

legal, advisory and due diligence fees, as applicable, and (iii) other acquisition-related items, such as gains and
losses on the settlement of contingent consideration. Our internal decision maker believes OCF is a meaningful
measure because it represents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance that is unaffected by our
capital structure and allows management to (a) readily view operating trends, (b) perform analytical comparisons
and benchmarking between entities and (c) identify strategies to improve operating performance. We believe our
OCF measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our performance with the
performance of other companies in the same or similar industries, although our measure may not be directly
comparable to similar measures used by other companies. OCF should be viewed as a measure of operating
performance that is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, operating income or loss, net earnings or loss, cash
flow from operating activities and other U.S. GAAP measures of income or cash flows. A reconciliation of
operating income to OCF is presented under “Summary Financial and Operating Data of VodafoneZiggo” in this
Offering Circular.

**Subscriber Data**

Each subscriber is counted as a revenue generating unit (“RGU”) for each broadband communication
service subscribed. Thus, a subscriber who receives digital cable television, broadband internet and fixed-line
telephony services from us (regardless of their number of telephony access lines) would be counted as three
RGUs. Mobile subscribers are counted based on the number of subscriber identification module (“SIM”) cards in
service. The subscriber data included in this Offering Circular, including penetration RGU figures, rates and
average monthly subscription revenue earned per average RGU or mobile subscriber, as applicable (“ARPU”),
are determined by management, are not part of VodafoneZiggo’s financial statements and have not been audited
or otherwise reviewed by an outside independent auditor, consultant or expert or by any of the Initial Purchasers.

**Third-Party Information**

The information provided in this Offering Circular on the market environment, market developments,
growth rates, market trends and on the competitive situation in the markets and segments in which we operate are
based (to the extent not otherwise indicated) on third-party data, statistical information and reports as well as our
own internal estimates.

Market studies are frequently based on information and assumptions that may not be exact or appropriate,
and their methodology is by nature forward-looking and speculative. This Offering Circular also contains
estimates made by us based on third-party market data, which in turn is based on published market data or figures
from publicly available sources.

Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have verified the figures, market data or other information on which
third parties have based their studies nor have such third parties verified the external sources on which such
estimates are based. Therefore neither we nor the Initial Purchasers guarantee nor do we or the Initial Purchasers
assume responsibility for the accuracy of the information from third-party studies presented in this Offering
Circular or for the accuracy of the information on which such estimates are based.

This Offering Circular also contains estimates of market data and information derived therefrom which
cannot be gathered from publications by market research institutions or any other independent sources. Such
information is based on our internal estimates. In many cases there is no publicly available information on such
market data, for example from industry associations, public authorities or other organizations and institutions.
We believe that these internal estimates of market data and information derived therefrom are helpful in order to
give investors a better understanding of the industry in which we operate as well as our position within this
industry. Although we believe that our internal market observations are reliable, our estimates are not reviewed
or verified by any external sources. We assume no responsibility for the accuracy of our estimates and the
information derived therefrom. These may deviate from estimates made by our competitors or future statistics
provided by market research institutes or other independent sources. We cannot assure you that our estimates or
the assumptions are accurate or correctly reflect the state and development of, or our position in, the industry.

rates, as published by Bloomberg, of U.S. dollars expressed as euro. The rates below may differ from the actual
rates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and other financial information appearing in

represent such U.S. dollar amounts or that such amounts could have been converted into U.S. dollars at any
particular rate, if at all. Unless otherwise indicated, convenience translations into euro or any other currency have
been calculated at the 30 June 2019 market rate.

**The Issuer**

The Issuer, VZ Vendor Financing B.V., was incorporated as a limited liability company under Dutch law
(besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) on 16 October 2019, having its official seat in
Amsterdam, the Netherlands and registered with the Dutch commercial register under number 76130592. The
registered office of the Issuer is at Herikerbergweg 238, Luna ArenA, 1101CM Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The
Issuer does not have an authorized share capital. The Issuer has issued 100 ordinary shares of €1 each (the
“Existing Shares”) and will issue a number of ordinary shares equal to the Minimum Issuer Capitalization
Amount (the “Issue Date Shares”, together with the Existing Shares, the “Shares”), if any, in connection with
the offering of the Notes, which are and will be, respectively, fully paid up and held by the Foundation.

The Issuer has, and will have, no material assets other than the Assigned Receivables held from time to
time, the balances standing to the credit of the Issuer Transaction Accounts and the benefit of the Transaction
Documents to which the Issuer is or may become a party or in respect of which it has or may have any right, title,
benefit or interest (including the New VFZ Facilities Agreement, the Expenses Agreement, the Issue Date
Arrangements Agreement and the Framework Assignment Agreement), such fees (as agreed) payable to it in
connection with the issue of the Notes and the sum of €100 representing the proceeds of its issued and paid up
ordinary share capital which is held in the Issuer Transaction Accounts. The Issuer is dependent upon payments it
receives in respect of the Assigned Receivables and under the Framework Assignment Agreement, the New VFZ
Facilities Agreement, the Expenses Agreement and the related agreements to make payments on the Notes.

None of VodafoneZiggo or its respective subsidiaries have any equity or voting interest in the Issuer, and
accordingly, the Issuer will not be consolidated into VodafoneZiggo’s consolidated financial statements. See
“Risk Factors—General Risks—VodafoneZiggo may be required to consolidate the Issuer into its consolidated
_financial statements and the Notes may be redeemed on or before 30 days after the Issue Date”._

**Overview of the Structure of the Offering of the Notes**

As part of the Transactions, the Issuer intends to issue €400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the
Notes. As more fully described below, the proceeds from the offering of the Notes will be used to purchase
eligible payment obligations and accounts receivable relating thereto owing by VodafoneZiggo and certain of its
subsidiaries, to make certain loans available to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower and for the other purposes
described herein. Defined terms used but not defined herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the
“Definitions” section.

In the course of their business, VodafoneZiggo and its subsidiaries purchase goods and/or services from
suppliers pursuant to the terms of various supply contracts, and those suppliers issue invoices requiring the
relevant Buyer Entity (as defined below) to make payment for the purchase of such goods and/or services on the
terms specified in the applicable invoice and supply contract. Each invoice evidences an amount payable by a
Buyer Entity to a Supplier (as defined below) as a result of an existing business relationship and includes all
rights attaching thereto under the relevant contract to which such invoice relates and the SCF Platform
Documents (as defined below) (as defined and further described in “Description of the Receivables” included
elsewhere in this Offering Circular, each, a “Receivable” and collectively, the “Receivables”). From time to
time, a Buyer Entity may upload an Electronic Data File containing details of Receivables payable to a Supplier
(as defined in Condition 1 (Definitions and Principles of Construction)) on to the SCF Platform (as defined
below) (an “Upload”). The designation of such uploaded Receivables as “approved” by a Buyer Entity (an
“Approved Platform Receivable”) will initially give rise to an independent and primary obligation by
VodafoneZiggo to make payment or cause payment to be made to the Relevant Recipient on the Confirmed
Payment Date (as defined below) in respect of such Approved Platform Receivable (a “Parent Payment
**Obligation”). As permitted in accordance with the terms pursuant to which the relevant assets were acquired**
and/or services supplied, the relevant Buyer Entity will specify, in such Electronic Data File, the date on which
such Parent Payment Obligation and the related Receivable will be paid (which date will be either the payment
due date indicated on the original invoice or a date up to 360 days from the payment due date indicated on the
original invoice date, each, a “Confirmed Payment Date”).

As part of its participation in the SCF Platform, each Supplier has agreed that it will offer to sell Parent
Payment Obligations and the related Receivables to the Platform Provider (as defined in Condition 1 (Definitions
_and Principles of Construction)). In such cases, the Platform Provider may purchase the relevant Parent Payment_
Obligation and such related Receivable from the Supplier at a price intended to be equal to the original face value
of the invoice owed to the Supplier (as further described below under “SCF Platform Documents—Discounted
_Payments Purchase Agreements”)._


2


-----

Upon each sale and assignment of a Parent Payment Obligation and the related Receivable from the
Supplier to the Platform Provider through the SCF Platform (each, an “Initial Transfer”), each Obligor will
become jointly and severally liable with each other Obligor to make payment or cause payment to be made to the
Relevant Recipient on the Confirmed Payment Date in respect of such Parent Payment Obligation (such Parent
Payment Obligation, as enhanced by the joint and several payment undertaking of each Obligor, a “Payment
**Obligation”). Pursuant to the Framework Assignment Agreement (as defined below), the Platform Provider may**
subsequently offer to sell and assign to the Issuer, on a non-recourse basis, eligible Payment Obligations and the
related Receivables (solely to the extent that such Receivables have been acquired by the Platform Provider)
(collectively and as further described and defined below, the “VFZ Accounts Receivable”).

On or about the Issue Date, the Issuer will use the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes plus any
upfront payment payable by the New VFZ Facilities Borrower under the New VFZ Facilities Agreement (as
defined below) to finance the purchase of eligible VFZ Accounts Receivable pursuant to the terms and conditions
of the Framework Assignment Agreement. To the extent that such proceeds from the offering of the Notes
exceed the amount of VFZ Accounts Receivable available for purchase by the Issuer on the first Value Date (as
defined below) falling on or after the Issue Date, the Issuer will advance any such excess proceeds to the New
VFZ Facilities Borrower as a revolving loan under the New VFZ Facilities Agreement (an “Excess Cash Loan”,
and collectively with other loans advanced under the Excess Cash Facility (as defined below) from time to time,
the “Excess Cash Loans”).

Following the Issue Date, as VFZ Accounts Receivable purchased by the Issuer (the “Assigned
**Receivables”) are settled on their respective Confirmed Payment Dates (as defined below), the Platform Provider**
(acting as collection agent for the Issuer under the Framework Assignment Agreement) will receive an amount
from the relevant Obligor (a “Collected Amount”) towards repayment of an amount equal to the Outstanding
Amount (as defined below) relating to such Assigned Receivables. The Issuer will use the Collected Amount,
_less the portion of such Collected Amount comprising Premium (as defined below) (each such difference, a_
“Collected Principal Amount”), to purchase (through the Platform Provider) new VFZ Accounts Receivable, to
the extent available for purchase, or to advance such funds to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower as additional
Excess Cash Loans. Excess Cash Loans will bear a rate of interest of %. The rate of interest on the Excess
Cash Loans, together with the interest earned on the Issue Date Facility Loans (as defined below) under the Issue
Date Facility (as defined below), is intended to provide the Issuer with the same rate of return in respect of the
Committed Principal Proceeds (as defined below) not invested in VFZ Accounts Receivable (including any
Retained Collected Amount (as defined below)) as Noteholders will receive in respect of the Notes. Interest on
the Excess Cash Loans and the Issue Date Facility Loans will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
comprising twelve 30-day months. From time to time, as further VFZ Accounts Receivable become available for
purchase through the SCF Platform, the Issuer will, directly or indirectly, fund such purchases with Collected
Principal Amounts and any Purchase Price Return Amounts (as defined below) which are expected to be credited
to the Issuer on the relevant Value Date (such amounts, collectively, “Interim Platform Amounts”), and to the
extent such purchases cannot be fully funded by Interim Platform Amounts, by demanding from the New VFZ
Facilities Borrower, on a weekly basis, repayment of a principal amount of Excess Cash Loans then outstanding
equal to such shortfall.

The primary sources of payment of interest on the Notes will be:

1. the premium earned by the Issuer on Assigned Receivables (the “Premium”), being an amount equal
to the difference between (i) the Outstanding Amounts (as further defined and described below under
“Purchases and Collections of VFZ Accounts Receivable—The Framework Assignment Agreement”)
collected upon maturity thereof, less (ii) the Purchase Price Amounts (as further defined and described
below under “Purchases and Collections of VFZ Accounts Receivable—The Framework Assignment
_Agreement”) at which such Assigned Receivables are initially purchased by the Issuer; and_

2. the interest earned by the Issuer on Excess Cash Loans and the Issue Date Facility Loans made to the
New VFZ Facilities Borrower under the New VFZ Facilities Agreement (the “VFZ Facilities Interest”).

Additionally, the Issuer may, from time to time, receive interest paid by the Platform Provider on
(i) Retained Collected Amounts (being Collected Amounts which have not been paid to the Issuer towards
satisfaction of the relevant Outstanding Amount and not been used to purchase further VFZ Accounts
Receivable) (such interest, the “Retained Collected Amount Interest”); (ii) Excess Requested Purchase Price
Amounts (as defined below), being funds transferred to the Platform Provider which have not been applied


3


-----

towards the purchase of new VFZ Accounts Receivables on the relevant Value Date (such interest, the “Excess
**Requested Purchase Price Interest”); and (iii) funds exceeding the Requested Purchase Price Amount**
Aggregate Limit (as defined below) of €50.0 million (such excess, the “Aggregate Amount Excess”,
collectively with the Excess Requested Purchase Price Amounts and Unutilised Collected Amounts (as defined
below), the “Purchase Price Return Amounts”), and which have not been repaid to the Issuer in accordance
with the timeframe set out in the Framework Assignment Agreement (such interest, as further defined and
described below, the “Delayed Aggregate Amount Interest”, collectively with the Retained Collected Amount
Interest and the Excess Requested Purchase Price Interest, the “Retained Amount Interest”). The Retained
Amount Interest will be calculated in accordance with the Framework Assignment Agreement (as described
below) and the Agency and Account Bank Agreement (as described elsewhere in this Offering Circular), and will
be deemed to accrue on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

The Premium, the VFZ Facilities Interest and the Retained Amount Interest are, collectively, the “Interest
**Proceeds”. To the extent the Interest Proceeds earned during an interest payment period are insufficient to fund**
scheduled payments of interest on the Notes, the deficiency will be made up by the New VFZ Facilities Borrower
via a Shortfall Payment (as defined below) to be paid to the Issuer.

The primary sources of repayment of principal on the Notes, on the Maturity Date or at early redemption of
the Notes in accordance with the Conditions, will be:

1. the Collected Principal Amounts repaid in respect of Assigned Receivables at their respective
maturities; and

2. repayments of Excess Cash Loans and (with respect to repayment of principal on the Maturity Date of the
Notes or at early redemption of the Notes in accordance with the Conditions) Issue Date Facility Loans.

Additionally, the Issuer may, from time to time, receive repayments from the Platform Provider of Purchase
Price Return Amounts (if any), which will be applied towards repayment of principal on the Notes on the
Maturity Date or at early redemption of the Notes in accordance with the Conditions.

Whether in respect of settlement of Assigned Receivables, repayment of loans advanced under the New
VFZ Facilities Agreement or funding of any Shortfall Payment, among other payment obligations, the Issuer will
ultimately be reliant on funds from the New VFZ Facilities Borrower and certain of its subsidiaries to make
payments due under the Notes.

In connection with the Transactions, the Issuer will enter into the following agreements, among others:

1. the Framework Assignment Agreement, pursuant to which the Issuer will periodically use any Excess
Cash to purchase available VFZ Accounts Receivable. References to “Excess Cash” are to uninvested
funds in an amount equal to (i) the Committed Principal Proceeds, minus (ii) the Requested Purchase
Price Amounts paid by the Issuer (taking into account any Interim Platform Amount) for any Assigned
Receivables outstanding as of the relevant determination date;

2. the New VFZ Facilities Agreement, pursuant to which the Issuer will (i) make loans (each, an
“Interest Facility Loan” and collectively, the “Interest Facility Loans”) to the New VFZ Facilities
Borrower under the Interest Facility (as defined below), (ii) to the extent that VFZ Accounts
Receivable are not available for purchase through the SCF Platform, use Excess Cash to make Excess
Cash Loans to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower under the Excess Cash Facility, (iii) make any Issue
Date Facility Loans to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower under the Issue Date Facility, and (iv) make
certain payments to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower (including any Excess Arrangement Payment (as
defined below)), and pursuant to which the New VFZ Facilities Borrower will make certain payments
to the Issuer (including any Shortfall Payment);

3. the Expenses Agreement, pursuant to which the Issuer will be entitled to (i) receive reimbursement
from the New VFZ Facilities Borrower in respect of certain fees and expenses of the Issuer, including
certain fees and expenses in relation to the issuance of the Notes, and (ii) receive certain payments
from the New VFZ Facilities Borrower in respect of amounts that may become due and payable in
respect of the Notes, including certain fees and expenses in relation to the issuance of the Notes, certain
tax liabilities of the Issuer, any Additional Amounts (as defined in the section titled “Terms and
_Conditions of the Notes”), any premiums on redemption of the Notes, and any interest on overdue_
amounts under the Notes; and


4


-----

4. the Agency and Account Bank Agreement, pursuant to which The Bank of New York Mellon, London
Branch as administrator will agree, among other things, to provide certain portfolio administration and
calculation services to and/or on behalf of the Issuer.

The terms of the Expenses Agreement, the New VFZ Facilities Agreement (including the Interest Facility,
the Excess Cash Facility and the Issue Date Facility thereunder), the Agency and Account Bank Agreement, the
Framework Assignment Agreement and the related SCF Platform Documents are more fully described below
under “New VFZ Facilities”, “Purchases and Collections of VFZ Accounts Receivable—The Framework
_Assignment Agreement”, “SCF Platform Documents”, and “Summary of Principal Documents” found elsewhere_
in this Offering Circular.

**_Issuer Transaction Accounts_**

of Collected Amounts on Assigned Receivables, other payments (if any) from the Platform Provider
pursuant to the Framework Assignment Agreement, and payments of amounts under the New VFZ
Facilities Agreement (with any such payments and amounts so received being immediately credited to
the Interest Proceeds Account or the Principal Proceeds Account, as applicable);

2. an “Interest Proceeds Account”, through which the Issuer will, among other things, finance the
payment of interest on the Notes; and

3. a “Principal Proceeds Account” (together with the Issuer Collection Account and the Interest

the Issuer upon collection (collectively, the “Collected Premium Amounts”);

2. any Retained Amount Interest paid by the Platform Provider;

3. any VFZ Facilities Interest;

4. the proceeds from the repayment of any Interest Facility Loan; and

5. any Shortfall Payment paid by the New VFZ Facilities Borrower pursuant to the New VFZ Facilities

the Framework Assignment Agreement; and

3. the principal amount of any Excess Cash Loans or (with respect to the final repayment date) Issue Date

1. to purchase available VFZ Accounts Receivable through the SCF Platform;

2. to make Excess Cash Loans to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower on a daily basis, and

3. upon the maturity of the Notes, to repay amounts outstanding under the Notes.

**_Purchases and Collections of VFZ Accounts Receivable—The Framework Assignment Agreement_**

On or about the Issue Date, the Issuer, as purchaser, will enter into the Framework Assignment Agreement (as
defined in Condition 1 (Definitions and Principles of Construction)) with, among others, the Platform Provider,
VodafoneZiggo as the parent (the “Buyer Parent”) and The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch as
administrator. Under the Framework Assignment Agreement, from time to time commencing on the Issue Date, the
Issuer may purchase and have assigned to it on a non-recourse basis, up to the total amount of Committed Principal
Proceeds, and the Platform Provider may sell and assign on a non-recourse basis, eligible VFZ Accounts Receivable
that are made available by Suppliers and uploaded by the Buyer Entities to the SCF Platform. For purposes of this
overview, “VFZ Account Receivable” means a Payment Obligation and the Receivable in respect of which such
Payment Obligation has arisen, solely to the extent that such Receivable has been acquired by the Platform Provider.

Each VFZ Account Receivable to be purchased by the Issuer must meet, and the Buyer Parent will represent
and warrant (on behalf of itself and as agent for the Buyer Entities) on the date of each sale and assignment of any
VFZ Account Receivable from the Platform Provider to the Issuer (each such date, an “Assignment Date”) in
accordance with the Framework Assignment Agreement, that such VFZ Account Receivable meets, the following
eligibility criteria: that such VFZ Account Receivable (i) (with respect to the Payment Obligation component of
such VFZ Account Receivable only) is owed by the Obligors on a joint and several basis; (ii) (with respect to the
Payment Obligation component of such VFZ Account Receivable only) is governed by English law; (iii) is
denominated in euros; (iv) (with respect to the Payment Obligation component of such VFZ Account Receivable
only) is the legal, valid and binding obligation of each Obligor; (v) is capable of being freely and validly transferred
in the manner provided by the Framework Assignment Agreement, so that on purchase the Issuer will receive good
title; (vi) is due and payable in full without any right of set-off, counterclaim or deduction in favour of the Buyer
Entities; and (vii) has a maturity date that is no later than two Business Days prior to the Maturity Date of the Notes.
For a further description of the VFZ Accounts Receivable, see “Description of the Receivables” included elsewhere
in this Offering Circular. Additionally, immediately prior to each Assignment Date, the Platform Provider will
represent and warrant that it is entitled to assign the relevant Payment Obligation pursuant to the terms of the
Framework Assignment Agreement, and that it has not assigned, transferred or otherwise disposed of, or created
any encumbrance or security interest over, such Payment Obligation. Furthermore, the Platform Provider will
undertake that it will not, without the consent of the Issuer, take any action that would adversely affect a Payment
Obligation or the Issuer’s interest(s) therein (as further described in “Summary of Principal Documents—
_Framework Assignment Agreement” included elsewhere in this Offering Circular)._

-----

Each Payment Obligation will be the joint and several obligation of the New VFZ Facilities Borrower and
each of the New VFZ Facilities Obligors (as defined below). On the Issue Date, the eligible Obligors will be
VodafoneZiggo and VZ Financing II B.V. (each, a “New VFZ Facilities Obligor” and collectively, the “New
**VFZ Facilities Obligors”, and together with the New VFZ Facilities Borrower, the “Obligors”).**

_Purchases of VFZ Accounts Receivable with Requested Purchase Price Amounts_

On or following the Issue Date (as further described in “Capitalization of VodafoneZiggo” included
elsewhere in this Offering Circular), the Platform Provider is expected to sell and assign to the Issuer VFZ
Accounts Receivable for a Requested Purchase Price Amount of €400.0 million, which the Issuer will fund with
all or a portion of the Committed Principal Proceeds. See “Use of Proceeds”. It is expected that the Issuer will
complete its initial purchases of new and existing VFZ Accounts Receivable by 31 March 2020. In connection
with such sale and assignment, the Platform Provider will deliver to the Issuer:

1. an assignment framework note (substantially in the form attached to the Framework Assignment
Agreement, an “Assignment Framework Note”) to be accepted and agreed to by the Issuer, pursuant
to which the Issuer will agree, among other things, to purchase Payment Obligations (and the
Receivables related thereto, solely to the extent that such Receivables have been acquired by the
Platform Provider), in whole but not in part, at the relevant Purchase Price Amounts in an aggregate
amount equal to a limit (in respect of purchased Payment Obligations which have not been settled)
specified therein (the “Purchase Limit”); and

2. one or more notices related to such Assignment Framework Note (substantially in the form attached to
the Framework Assignment Agreement, each an “Assignment Notice”) instructing the Issuer to pay to
the Platform Provider, as consideration for the sale and assignment of the relevant VFZ Accounts
Receivable, a requested amount (a “Requested Purchase Price Amount”) on the date falling five
Business Days following receipt by the Issuer of such Assignment Notice (a “Value Date”).

As used herein, a “Purchase Price Amount” means, in relation to any VFZ Account Receivable, an amount
equal to the Outstanding Amount (as defined below) of such VFZ Account Receivable less the Applied Discount
(as defined in the context of the Framework Assignment Agreement) (as defined below) calculated as at the
relevant Assignment Date. “Outstanding Amount” means, with respect to a Payment Obligation, an amount
equal to (i) the gross amount of the Approved Platform Receivable in respect of which the Payment Obligation
arose, less (ii) the sum of all Credit Notes (as defined below under “SCF Platform Documents—Accounts
_Payable Management Services Agreement”) allocated to that Payment Obligation pursuant to the terms of the_
APMSA. “Applied Discount” refers (i) in the context of the APMSA, to the discount amount that the Platform
Provider will deduct from the Certified Amount (as defined below under “SCF Platform Documents—Accounts
_Payable Management Services Agreement”) in case of a transfer of the Payment Obligation prior to the_
Confirmed Payment Date pursuant to the terms of the APMSA and each relevant Discounted Payments Purchase
Agreement and (ii) in the context of the Framework Assignment Agreement, to the discount amount that the
Platform Provider will deduct from the Certified Amount in the case of a transfer of the Payment Obligation prior
to the Confirmed Payment Date pursuant to the terms of the APMSA and each relevant Discounted Payments
Purchase Agreement, less the processing fee due to the Platform Provider specified in the APMSA (which will
initially be 0.20%) (the “Platform Provider Processing Fee”).

From time to time following the Issue Date, the Platform Provider may, at its discretion (but not more than
once per week prior to the service of a notice of termination (as further described below)) and to the extent that
the Requested Purchase Price Amount specified in such Assignment Notice together with all other outstanding
Requested Purchase Price Amounts which have not been applied towards the purchase of VFZ Accounts
Receivable would not exceed €50.0 million at such time (the “Requested Purchase Price Amount Aggregate
**Limit”), serve further Assignment Notices (which may also be Primary Assignment Notices (as defined and**
further described below under “—Collections on Assigned Receivables and Further Purchases of VFZ Accounts
_Receivable with Collected Principal Amounts”)) to the Issuer pursuant to the relevant Assignment Framework_
Note.

Following the receipt of an Assignment Notice, so long as no Non-Compliance Event (as defined below) has
occurred and is continuing, the Issuer will pay, on the relevant Value Date, the relevant Requested Purchase Price
Amount (which may be adjusted as further described below) to the Platform Provider, which shall have the effect
of the Platform Provider immediately selling and assigning, without further action on the part of any person or


7


-----

entity, all of its rights, title and interest in and to the relevant Payment Obligations (and the Receivables related
thereto, solely to the extent that such Receivables have been acquired by the Platform Provider) at the relevant
Purchase Price Amounts to the Issuer pursuant to the relevant Assignment Framework Note (an “Assignment”).
The Requested Purchase Price Amount (and the corresponding VFZ Accounts Receivable) will be adjusted if the
aggregate of all Requested Purchase Price Amounts, together with (without double counting) the aggregate of all
Purchase Price Amounts in respect of outstanding Assigned Receivables would be higher than the relevant
Purchase Limit specified in that Assignment Framework Note. In such event, the Issuer must notify the Platform
Provider within two Business Days of receipt of the relevant Assignment Notice (i) of such circumstance and
(ii) that the Requested Purchase Price Amount will (A) be reduced to equal the amount which would cause the
aggregate Requested Purchase Price Amount, together with (without double counting) the aggregate of all
Purchase Price Amounts in respect of outstanding Assigned Receivables to equal such Purchase Limit and/or
(B) cancelled to the extent necessary such that the relevant assignment is for the whole, and not part, of the VFZ
Accounts Receivable.

The Issuer will not be obliged to pay a Requested Purchase Price Amount specified in an Assignment Notice
if any of the following events (each, a “Non-Compliance Event”) have occurred and is continuing (provided that
the Issuer notifies the Platform Provider, within two Business Days of the receipt of such Assignment Notice,
that one or more Non-Compliance Events have occurred and of the Issuer’s intention not to comply with such
Assignment Notice): (i) if the Framework Assignment Agreement or relevant Assignment Framework Note has
been terminated prior to the date of such Assignment Notice; (ii) if the terms and conditions of such Assignment
Notice materially deviate from the terms and conditions of the Framework Assignment Agreement or the
relevant Assignment Framework Note; (iii) if an Obligor Event of Default (as defined below) is continuing in
respect of any Obligor; and/or (iv) if a specified insolvency event occurs in respect of the Platform Provider
which directly results in the Platform Provider not continuing its business as contemplated under the Framework
Assignment Agreement. If, following the receipt of a Requested Purchase Price Amount on a Value Date, the
Platform Provider has acquired (or determines that it will on such Value Date acquire) insufficient VFZ Accounts
Receivable to apply the whole of the Requested Purchase Price Amount received on such Value Date, the
Platform Provider will either (i) serve, on such Value Date, one or more notices (substantially in the form set out
in the Framework Assignment Agreement, each, a “Purchase Price Return Notice”) to the Issuer and, on the
Business Day following the date of such Purchase Price Return Notice (a “Settlement Date”), pay to the Issuer
Collection Account, the excess Requested Purchase Price Amount not applied towards the purchase of VFZ
Accounts Receivable (such excess, the “Excess Requested Purchase Price Amount”); or (ii) retain such Excess
Requested Purchase Price Amount for a period of up to four Business Days following such Value Date (an
“Excess Retention Period”, and the final day thereof (which, at the Platform Provider’s discretion, may occur
prior to the fourth Business Day following such Value Date), the “Excess Retention Period End Date”) to be
applied towards the purchase of any VFZ Accounts Receivable arising during such Excess Retention Period. If
the Platform Provider chooses to retain such Excess Requested Purchase Price Amount, it further agrees that (i) if
the Platform Provider acquires any VFZ Accounts Receivable during such Excess Retention Period, it will sell
and assign such VFZ Accounts Receivables to the Issuer (and the Platform Provider will be deemed to have
served an Assignment Notice in respect of such Assigned Receivables); and (ii) on the Business Day prior to the
Excess Retention Period End Date, the Platform Provider will serve a Purchase Price Return Notice in respect of
any remaining Excess Requested Purchase Price Amount to the Issuer, and subsequently pay such remaining
Excess Requested Purchase Price Amount to the Issuer Collection Account on such Excess Retention Period End
Date, together with all Excess Requested Purchase Price Interest (as defined below) due in respect thereof.
“Excess Requested Purchase Price Interest” shall accrue daily at the Funding Rate, calculated on any Excess
Requested Purchase Price Amount retained by the Platform Provider (and not applied towards the purchase of
VFZ Accounts Receivable), from (and including) the first day of the relevant Excess Retention Period to (and
including) the relevant Excess Retention Period End Date, or such later date on which the Issuer receives such
Excess Requested Purchase Price Amount together with all interest due in respect thereof. As used herein,
“Funding Rate” means a rate equal to the per annum margin specified in Clause 13.1 of the APMSA (less the
Platform Provider Processing Fee) over 1-month EURIBOR; provided that if 1-month EURIBOR is less than
zero, 1-month EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero.

Additionally, if on any Business Day the aggregate Requested Purchase Price Amounts held by the Platform
Provider (and not applied towards the purchase of VFZ Accounts Receivable) exceeds the Requested Purchase
Price Amount Aggregate Limit (such excess, an “Aggregate Amount Excess”), the Platform Provider will
immediately serve a Purchase Price Return Notice in respect of such Aggregate Amount Excess, and pay such
Aggregate Amount Excess to the Issuer Collection Account on the relevant Settlement Date. Any Aggregate


8


-----

Amount Excess not returned to the Issuer by the relevant Settlement Date (such amount, a “Delayed Aggregate
**Amount”) shall accrue interest daily at the Funding Rate, calculated from (and including) such Settlement Date**
to (and including) such later date on which the Issuer receives the Delayed Aggregate Amount, together with all
interest due in respect thereof (the “Delayed Aggregate Amount Interest”).

_Collections on Assigned Receivables and Further Purchases of VFZ Accounts Receivable with Collected_
_Principal Amounts_

Prior to the service of an Obligor Enforcement Notification (as defined and further described below), the
Platform Provider will act as collection agent for the Issuer in respect of any Collected Amounts received or
recovered relating to Assigned Receivables, in accordance with the SCF Platform Documents. Except in
circumstances where certain Collected Principal Amounts are applied towards the purchase of new VFZ
Accounts Receivable (as further described below), the Platform Provider will apply any Collected Amount,
within one Business Day of receipt or recovery thereof (such scheduled date of application, a “Collected
**Amount Forwarding Date”), in or towards the repayment to the Issuer of an amount equal to the Outstanding**
Amount of the relevant Assigned Receivables (to the extent that such Assigned Receivables remain outstanding
and has not been settled or otherwise paid to the Issuer).

From time to time, the Platform Provider may serve an Assignment Notice (a “Primary Assignment
**Notice”) which states that any Collected Principal Amounts in respect of Assigned Receivables relating to such**
Primary Assignment Notice are to be treated as further payments of Requested Purchase Price Amounts. So long
as (i) no Non-Compliance Event has occurred and is continuing (and in respect of which the Issuer has notified
the Platform Provider that the purchase mechanics described in this paragraph will not apply), (ii) the Requested
Purchase Price Amount Aggregate Limit will not be exceeded upon the deemed payment of the Requested
Purchase Price Amount in the New Assignment Notice (as defined below), upon receipt by the Platform Provider
of any Collected Amount on an Assigned Receivable relating to such Primary Assignment Notice, or (iii) no
notice of termination has been served (as further described below), then (a) the Platform Provider will be deemed
to have served an Assignment Notice on exactly the same terms as the Primary Assignment Notice, except for the
Requested Purchase Price Amount (which will be equal to the Collected Principal Amount that would otherwise
be due and payable to the Issuer) (such notice, the “New Assignment Notice”); and (b) the Platform Provider’s
obligation to pay such Collected Principal Amount to the Issuer will be set off against the Issuer’s obligation to
pay the Requested Purchase Price Amount under the New Assignment Notice. For the avoidance of doubt, the
purchase mechanics described in this paragraph will not affect the Platform Provider’s obligation to pay to the
Issuer any Premium on the relevant Collected Amount Forwarding Date. If, three Business Days following the
service of a New Assignment Notice, the Platform Provider still holds any Collected Amounts which have not
been utilised for the purchase of new VFZ Accounts Receivable (such amounts, “Unutilised Collected
**Amounts”), the Platform Provider will immediately serve a Purchase Price Return Notice to the Issuer in respect**
of such Unutilised Collected Amounts, and will pay such Unutilised Collected Amounts to the Issuer Collection
Account on the relevant Settlement Date. The Platform Provider will pay the Issuer interest on any “Retained
**Collected Amounts” (being any Collected Amount which has not been paid to the Issuer towards satisfaction of**
the relevant Outstanding Amount and not been used to purchase further VFZ Accounts Receivable as described
above). Interest on Retained Collected Amounts shall accrue daily at the Funding Rate, calculated from (and
including) the relevant scheduled Collected Amount Forwarding Date to (and including) the relevant Settlement
Date or such later date on which the Issuer receives the Retained Collected Amount, together with all interest due
in respect thereof, as the case may be (the “Retained Collected Amount Interest”), and will be paid to the
Issuer Collection Account on the relevant Settlement Date or such later date, as applicable.

_Obligor Events of Default and Obligor Enforcement Notification_

The Issuer may not serve (or cause or permit to be served) a notice to the Obligors informing them of an
Assignment (an “Obligor Enforcement Notification”) prior to the occurrence of (i) a failure by any Obligor to
pay any Payment Obligation in full to the Platform Provider on the date such payment was due (taking into
account any applicable grace period under the APMSA), (ii) a specified insolvency event in respect of any
Obligor, (iii) a breach of the representations and warranties of the Buyer Parent with respect to the eligibility of
the VFZ Accounts Receivable, which is not capable of remedy (or if such breach is capable of remedy, is not
remedied within five Business Days of notice) (each such event in (i) to (iii), an “Obligor Event of Default”), or
(iv) a specified insolvency event in respect of the Platform Provider. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to the
_Receivables and the SCF Platform—The transfer of VFZ Accounts Receivable under the Framework Assignment_
_Agreement takes place only under equity until an Obligor Enforcement Notification is given to the Obligors”._


9


-----

Following the occurrence of any of the foregoing events, the Issuer may serve or direct the Platform Provider to
serve an Obligor Enforcement Notification (provided that the Platform Provider may, but is not obliged to, serve
an Obligor Enforcement Notification at any time as it sees fit and pursuant to the circumstances described in the
paragraph below).

As soon as reasonably practicable after the occurrence of an Obligor Event of Default, the Platform Provider
will, among other things, (i) provide the Issuer with notice of such Obligor Event of Default and the details
thereof, as well as regular status updates with respect to the affected Assigned Receivables; (ii) turn over to the
Issuer any Purchase Price Return Amount in accordance with the terms of the Framework Assignment
Agreement; and (iii) in consultation with the Issuer and the Buyer Parent (provided such consultation is permitted
by the terms of the Framework Assignment Agreement), take (or refrain from taking) any steps that the Platform
Provider sees fit to recover all amounts payable, as well as default interest and other costs and expenses, each as
permitted under the APMSA and the relevant Discounted Payments Purchase Agreement(s). Following service of
an Obligor Enforcement Notification, the Platform Provider will cease to act as the Issuer’s collection agent in
respect of the relevant Assigned Receivables. For a further description of the provisions relating to Obligor
Events of Default and Obligor Enforcement Notifications, see “Summary of Principal Documents—Framework
_Assignment Agreement” included elsewhere in this Offering Circular._

_Assignment and Termination_

The Issuer may assign or transfer its rights under the Framework Assignment Agreement and the
Assignment Framework Notes (including its rights to Assigned Receivables), without the consent of the other
parties only in certain specified circumstances and in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Framework
Assignment Agreement, as further described under “Summary of Principal Documents—Framework Assignment
_Agreement” included elsewhere in this Offering Circular. Similarly, the Platform Provider may assign or transfer_
its rights under the Framework Assignment Agreement in the same such specified circumstances; provided,
_however, that the Platform Provider may assign or transfer any of its rights in Assigned Receivables to an_
affiliate without the consent of any other party, and may also assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations
under the Framework Assignment Agreement, as the provider and administrator of the SCF Platform, with the
prior written consent of the Issuer (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

The Framework Assignment Agreement and/or any Assignment Framework Note issued thereunder may be
terminated by the Issuer or the Platform Provider upon 10 Business Days’ prior notice to the other parties thereto;
_provided that with respect to a termination by the Platform Provider, the effective date of the termination shall_
not be earlier than the effective date of termination of the APMSA (as further described below). Additionally, the
Platform Provider and/or the Issuer may terminate the Framework Assignment Agreement and/or any
Assignment Framework Note with immediate effect upon the occurrence of certain events, including a breach of
material obligations of the Buyer Parent (subject to a 30 days grace period), a material breach of the
representation and warranties of the Buyer Parent (subject to a 30 days grace period), or if a specified insolvency
event has occurred in respect of the Buyer Parent. For a further description of termination events, see “Summary
_of Principal Documents—Framework Assignment Agreement” included elsewhere in this Offering Circular._

The terms of the related SCF Platform documents are more fully described below under “SCF Platform
_Documents”._

**_New VFZ Facilities_**

On any Business Day which is not a Value Date, and on any Value Date (in this case, to the extent that there
are any Committed Principal Proceeds that cannot be invested in VFZ Accounts Receivable due to a shortage of
VFZ Accounts Receivable available for purchase through the SCF Platform), the Issuer will utilize any Excess
Cash to make interest-bearing Excess Cash Loans to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower under the New VFZ
Facilities Agreement, as further described below. This use of Excess Cash, together with the interest earned on
the Issue Date Facility Loans, will provide the Issuer with the same rate of return in respect of the Committed
Principal Proceeds not invested in VFZ Accounts Receivable (including any Retained Collected Amounts) as
Noteholders will receive in respect of the Notes, instead of leaving the same funds (represented by the Excess
Cash) uninvested in the Principal Proceeds Account pending their application for the purchase of VFZ Accounts
Receivable. In addition, since the Issuer was formed solely for the purpose of facilitating the Transactions and
issuing the Notes, and is not expected to engage in any business activities other than those related to its formation


10


-----

and the Transactions (including the offering of the Notes and the funding of loans under the New VFZ Facilities
Agreement), the Issuer intends to lend any Interest Proceeds that it collects from time to time to the New VFZ
Facilities Borrower, in the form of non-interest bearing Interest Facility Loans under the New VFZ Facilities
Agreement, as further described below. The Issuer will also fund interest-bearing Issue Date Facility Loans under
the Issue Date Facility, as further described below. Proceeds of any loans made by the Issuer to the New VFZ
Facilities Borrower under the New VFZ Facilities Agreement may be used by the New VFZ Facilities Borrower
for general corporate purposes.

On the Issue Date, the Issuer, as lender, will enter into a senior unsecured facilities agreement (the “New
**VFZ Facilities Agreement”) with the New VFZ Facilities Borrower, as borrower, the New VFZ Facilities**
Obligors, as guarantors, and The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch as administrator for the Issuer
(together with any successor thereto approved or appointed by the Issuer, the “Administrator”), pursuant to
which the Issuer will make available to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower revolving and term credit facilities,
consisting of the Interest Facility, the Excess Cash Facility and the Issue Date Facility, as described below.

_Interest Facility_

The New VFZ Facilities Agreement will provide for a revolving credit facility (the “Interest Facility”)
under which the Issuer will from time to time fund non-interest-bearing Interest Facility Loans to the New VFZ
Facilities Borrower.

Following the Issue Date, on any Business Day other than the Business Day prior to an Interest Payment
Date, if the Interest Proceeds deposited in the Interest Proceeds Account are greater than zero, the Issuer will
apply such Interest Proceeds to fund a new Interest Facility Loan to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower.

_Excess Cash Facility_

The New VFZ Facilities Agreement will also provide for a revolving credit facility (the “Excess Cash
**Facility”), in an aggregate principal amount up to the Committed Principal Proceeds, under which the Issuer will**
from time to time fund Excess Cash Loans to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower. Interest on Excess Cash Loans
will be payable semi-annually in arrears on the earlier of (i) each 15 April and 15 October, commencing 15 April,
2020 (each, an “Excess Cash Interest Period Date”) and (ii) upon repayment of a Weekly Excess Cash
Repayment Amount (as defined below). Interest will accrue from the funding date of any Excess Cash Loan at a
rate of % per annum, and will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day
months. Payment of interest in respect of any interest period ending on any Excess Cash Interest Period Date will
occur no less than one Business Day prior to such Excess Cash Interest Period Date.

On or following the Issue Date, the Issuer will use the Committed Principal Proceeds, firstly, to purchase
available VFZ Accounts Receivable pursuant to the Framework Assignment Agreement and, secondly, to fund
an initial Excess Cash Loan.

Following the Issue Date, as the Platform Provider (on a weekly basis) serves or is deemed to serve an
Assignment Notice to the Issuer instructing the Issuer to pay a Requested Purchase Price Amount (as may be
adjusted or off set pursuant to the terms of the Framework Assignment Agreement) as consideration for the sale
and assignment of the relevant VFZ Accounts Receivable on the relevant Value Date, the Issuer will, upon not
less than five Business Days’ prior notice, demand repayment by the New VFZ Facilities Borrower of such
portion of principal of any outstanding Excess Cash Loans as is equal to (i) such Requested Purchase Price
Amount to be paid for VFZ Accounts Receivable that the Issuer expects to purchase on such Value Date, less
(ii) any Interim Platform Amounts credited on such Value Date (such amount demanded, a “Weekly Excess
**Cash Repayment Amount”). The New VFZ Facilities Borrower will be obligated to pay into the Issuer**
Collection Account (for immediate onwards crediting to the Principal Proceeds Account) the Weekly Excess
Cash Repayment Amount on the fifth Business Day following receipt of such notice. The interest accrued on
such Weekly Excess Cash Repayment Amount will not be repaid but will, on that date, be deemed loaned to the
New VFZ Facilities Borrower under a new Interest Facility Loan. On the relevant Value Date, the Issuer will
apply the Weekly Excess Cash Repayment Amount so received, together with any Interim Platform Amounts
credited on the same day, towards its purchase of VFZ Accounts Receivable.

On any Business Day (other than the date on which the Notes are redeemed or repaid, in whole or in part (or
on which corresponding payment by the New VFZ Facilities Borrower is required to be made to the Issuer in
relation to any such redemption or repayment)), if the balance of funds deposited into the Principal Proceeds


11


-----

Account is greater than zero, the Issuer will apply such funds, firstly, towards the purchase of available VFZ
Accounts Receivable in accordance with the Framework Assignment Agreement (if such Business Day is also a
Value Date) and, secondly, to fund an Excess Cash Loan to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower.

_Issue Date Facility_

The New VFZ Facilities Agreement will further provide for a term loan facility (the “Issue Date Facility”
and, together with the Interest Facility and the Excess Cash Facility, the “New VFZ Facilities”), under which the
Issuer will fund interest-bearing loans to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower (the “Issue Date Facility Loans”).
Interest on the Issue Date Facility Loans will be payable semi-annually in arrears on each 15 April and
15 October (each, an “Issue Date Facility Interest Period Date”). Interest will accrue from the Issue Date at a
rate of % per annum, and will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprising twelve 30-day
months. Payment of interest in respect of any interest period ending on any Issue Date Facility Interest Period
Date will occur no less than one Business Day prior to such Issue Date Facility Interest Period Date.

On or prior to the Issue Date, the New VFZ Facilities Borrower, the Issuer and Stichting Trade Finance (in
its capacity as the sole shareholder of the Issuer, the “Foundation”) will enter into an agreement pursuant to
which the New VFZ Facilities Borrower will agree to pay the Foundation an amount representing the
Subscription Proceeds and the Subscriber Profit in return for the Foundation procuring that the Issuer enters into
certain Transaction Documents in connection with the offering of the Notes. Such payment will be conditional on
the Foundation subscribing for an amount of the Issuer’s ordinary shares equal to the Minimum Issuer
Capitalization Amount (the “Issue Date Shares”), which the Issuer will allot and issue to the Foundation. The
Issuer will lend the Subscription Proceeds from the Issue Date Shares, if any, to the New VFZ Facilities
Borrower as an Issue Date Facility Loan under the Issue Date Facility. In practice, the process will be almost
cashless, as nearly all of the payment by the New VFZ Facilities Borrower to the Foundation will ultimately be
loaned back to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower as an Issue Date Facility Loan. Principal and accrued interest (if
applicable) on the New VFZ Facilities will become due and payable in full on the earlier of (i) the Maturity Date
of the Notes or (ii) the date of early redemption of the Notes in accordance with the Conditions.

The New VFZ Facilities Agreement will also provide for certain payments to the Issuer by the New VFZ
Facilities Borrower and certain payments to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower by the Issuer. On the Issue Date,
pursuant to the New VFZ Facilities Agreement, the New VFZ Facilities Borrower will pay to the Issuer an
upfront payment in an amount equal to any underwriting fees, commissions and/ or certain expenses incurred or
paid by the Issuer in relation to the issuance of the Notes (if any). In addition, the New VFZ Facilities Agreement
will provide for the periodic payment of Shortfall Payments or Excess Arrangement Payments, as described
below under “—Payment of Interest on the Notes.”

**_Payment of Interest on the Notes_**

Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrear on each 15 April and 15 October (each, an
“Interest Payment Date”), commencing in the case of the Notes offered hereby, 15 April 2020. Interest on the
Notes will accrue from the Issue Date at a rate of % per annum, and will be computed on the basis of a 360day year comprising of twelve 30-day months. Pursuant to the terms of the New VFZ Facilities Agreement and the
Expenses Agreement, and in consideration of the Issuer providing the New VFZ Facilities to the New VFZ
Facilities Borrower, the New VFZ Facilities Borrower will make certain payments to the Issuer to the extent
necessary to enable the Issuer to make interest payments when due under the Notes. The Issuer will fund the
payment of scheduled interest on the Notes on each Interest Payment Date from the Interest Proceeds Account as
follows:

1. firstly, to the extent that there are amounts in the Interest Proceeds Account on the Business Day prior
to such Interest Payment Date, the Issuer will utilize such amounts, towards the payment of scheduled
interest on the Notes;

2. secondly, the Issuer will demand, upon no less than six Business Days’ notice prior to such Interest
Payment Date, that the New VFZ Facilities Borrower prepay Interest Facility Loans under the Interest
Facility (and the New VFZ Facilities Borrower will repay such Interest Facility Loans on or prior to the
fifth Business Day following receipt of such demand), in a principal amount equal to the lesser of:

a. an amount equal to the interest due and payable on the Notes on such Interest Payment Date less
any amounts in the Interest Proceeds Account referred to in paragraph (1) above; and


12


-----

b. the total amount of Interest Facility Loans outstanding on the Business Day prior to such Interest
Payment Date.

The Issuer will deposit the proceeds of any Interest Facility Loans so prepaid into the Interest Proceeds
Account;

3. thirdly, on or prior to the Business Day immediately preceding each Interest Payment Date (other than the
Maturity Date of the Notes or at early redemption of the Notes in accordance with the Conditions), the
New VFZ Facilities Borrower will make a payment to the Issuer (each, as calculated in accordance with
the Agency and Account Bank Agreement, a “Term Shortfall Payment”) in an amount equal to the
positive difference, if any, between (i) the amount of interest due on the Notes on such Interest Payment
Date, less (ii) the sum of (x) the amount of any Interest Facility Loans to be repaid pursuant to paragraph
(2) above and (y) amounts in the Interest Proceeds Account referred to in paragraph (1) above.

4. By contrast to the Term Shortfall Payment, to the extent that on any Interest Payment Date (other than the
Maturity Date of the Notes or at early redemption of the Notes in accordance with the Conditions) there is
any balance on the Interest Facility Loans not repaid by the New VFZ Facilities Borrower to the Issuer
pursuant to paragraph (2) above, the Issuer will make a payment to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower
(each, as calculated in accordance with the Agency and Account Bank Agreement, a “Term Excess
**Arrangement Payment”) in an amount equal to such balance of the Interest Facility Loans outstanding**
on such Interest Payment Date. Any Term Excess Arrangement Payment will be paid as a rebate of
previously paid interest (on a cashless basis, by offsetting such Term Excess Arrangement Payment
against the amounts due by the New VFZ Facilities Borrower under the Interest Facility Loans).

5. fourthly, on or prior to the Business Day immediately preceding the final Interest Payment Date (being
the Maturity Date of the Notes or at early redemption of the Notes in accordance with the Conditions), the
New VFZ Facilities Borrower will make a payment to the Issuer (as calculated in accordance with the
Agency and Account Bank Agreement, a “Maturity Shortfall Payment” and, together with the Term
Shortfall Payments, the “Shortfall Payments” and each a “Shortfall Payment”) in an amount equal to
the positive difference, if any, between (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be repaid
together with the amount of interest due on the Notes on such final Interest Payment Date, less (ii) the
sum of:

a. all Collected Amounts on all Assigned Receivables to be repaid or prepaid to the Issuer on or prior
to two Business Days prior to the final Interest Payment Date;

b. any other amounts (including any accrued interest) due to be paid by the Platform Provider to the
Issuer pursuant to the Framework Assignment Agreement on or prior to two Business Days prior
to the final Interest Payment Date;

c. the principal amount of and interest due on all of the New VFZ Facilities Loans to be paid to the
Issuer on maturity of the New VFZ Facilities Loans; and

d. all other amounts in the Issuer Transaction Accounts (to the extent not included in any of the above).

6. By contrast to the Maturity Shortfall Payment, to the extent that any calculation in paragraph (5) above
results in a negative value, the Issuer will pay or transfer to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower (as
calculated in accordance with the Agency and Account Bank Agreement, a “Maturity Excess
**Payment” and, together with the Term Excess Arrangement Payments, the “Excess Arrangement**
**Payments” and each an “Excess Arrangement Payment”) (as a rebate of previously paid interest) in**
an amount which would return such negative value to zero; provided, however, that such payment will
only be made after all amounts due and payable to Noteholders under the Notes have been settled.

**_Approved Exchange Offer_**

In order to extend the availability of the committed financing for the purchase of VFZ Accounts Receivable
represented by the Committed Principal Proceeds beyond the Maturity Date of the Notes, the New VFZ Facilities
Borrower may, at any time, enter into an exchange offer and payables financing plan agreement (a “Plan
**Agreement”) with a new entity (a “New Issuer”). Pursuant to any such Plan Agreement, the New Issuer will**
procure from the New VFZ Facilities Borrower a commitment to cancel amounts of the New VFZ Facilities as
set forth below, and will enter into agreements with the New VFZ Facilities Borrower, VodafoneZiggo, the
Platform Provider, the Notes Trustee and other relevant counterparties providing for the New Issuer’s purchase
of VFZ Accounts Receivable on terms and conditions substantially similar to the Transaction Documents.


13


-----

Promptly after entering into the Plan Agreement, the New Issuer will launch an exchange offer (the
“Approved Exchange Offer”) designed to allow Noteholders to exchange up to a specified principal amount of
Notes for a principal amount of new notes (the “New Notes”) to be set out in the Approved Exchange Offer.
Upon consummation of the Approved Exchange Offer, subject to the terms of the Trust Deed:

(i) The New Issuer will issue a specified amount of New Notes to the Noteholders validly tendered into
the Approved Exchange Offer and not withdrawn. If, upon the expiration of the Approved Exchange
Offer, Noteholders have validly tendered more Notes than the New Issuer is able to accept pursuant to
the Approved Exchange Offer, the New Issuer will accept for exchange Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn on a pro rata basis, based on the proportion that the aggregate principal amount of Notes to
be accepted bears to the aggregate principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn; and

(ii) The Issuer will purchase from the New Issuer any Notes accepted by the New Issuer pursuant to the
Approved Exchange Offer and will cancel such purchased Notes. As consideration for such purchase,
the Issuer will simultaneously pay, assign and transfer to the New Issuer:

(A) Assigned Receivables such that (a) minus (b) is equal to or less than (c) plus (d); where (a) is the
Committed Principal Proceeds multiplied by the Relevant Percentage, where “Relevant
**Percentage” means the proportion that the aggregate principal amount of Notes accepted into the**
Approved Exchange Offer bears to the aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding as of the
date of consummation of the Approved Exchange Offer (the “Determination Date”), (b) is the
aggregate historical Purchase Price Amount of such Assigned Receivables assigned to the New
Issuer pursuant to this clause (A), (c) is the balance of Excess Cash Loans outstanding on the
Determination Date, and (d) is any Interim Platform Amounts to be credited to the Issuer on the
Determination Date. The Assigned Receivables to be assigned to the New Issuer pursuant to this
clause (A) will be selected by an independent financial, banking, accounting or other similar
advisor designated by VodafoneZiggo, the Issuer or the Administrator with a mandate to
maximise the aggregate Purchase Price Amount of the transferred Assigned Receivables whilst
ensuring that they have the shortest maturities possible. Assigned Receivables will only be
assigned and transferred to the New Issuer pursuant to this clause (A) in whole, and not in part;

(B) The cash proceeds from the repayment of Interest Facility Loans (to be demanded by the Issuer or
the Administrator) in an amount equal to (a) minus (b); where (a) is the accrued and unpaid
Premium that remained outstanding on the Assigned Receivables assigned pursuant to clause
(A) above as of the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date, and (b) is any accrued and
unpaid Retained Amount Interest that remained outstanding as of the Determination Date in
respect of the “Retained Amounts” (being collectively, Retained Collected Amounts, Delayed
Aggregate Amounts and/or Excess Requested Purchase Price Amounts) (as determined in
accordance with the Agency and Account Bank Agreement described elsewhere in this Offering
Circular) to be transferred to the New Issuer pursuant to clause (D) below, as applicable;

(C) The cash proceeds from the repayment of Excess Cash Loans (to be demanded by the Issuer or the
Administrator) in an amount equal to (a) minus (b) minus (c), where (a) is the Committed
Principal Proceeds multiplied by the Relevant Percentage, (b) is the aggregate Purchase Price
Amounts of Assigned Receivables assigned to the New Issuer pursuant to clause (A) above, and
(c) is any Interim Platform Amounts to be credited to the Issuer on the Determination Date;

(D) The cash proceeds from the payment by the Platform Provider to the Issuer on the Determination
Date of any Retained Amounts and any other Interim Platform Amounts; and

(E) An “Accrued Facility Interest and Shortfall Amount” equal to (a) minus (b) minus (c) minus
(d) minus (e), where (a) is the aggregate principal amount of Notes tendered into the Approved
Exchange Offer, (b) is the aggregate Purchase Price Amounts of the Assigned Receivables
assigned pursuant to clause (A) above plus accrued and unpaid Premium thereon through the
Determination Date, (c) is the amount of cash proceeds set out in clause (B) above, (d) is the
amount of cash proceeds set out in clause (C) above and (e) is the amount of cash proceeds set out
in clause (D) above. The Issuer will demand repayment of Excess Cash Loans in an amount equal
to any Accrued Facility Interest and Shortfall Amount in order to make such payment.

**_SCF Platform Documents_**

VFZ Accounts Receivable purchased by the Issuer pursuant to the Framework Assignment Agreement are
uploaded by the Buyer Entities to the SCF Platform (as defined in Condition 1 (Definitions and Principles of


14


-----

_Construction)) managed by the Platform Provider to facilitate receivables financing provided by the Platform_
Provider and other participating funding providers, including the Issuer. The SCF Platform is made available to
VodafoneZiggo and certain of its subsidiaries, and is administered under the terms of the Accounts Payable
Management Services Agreement and the Discounted Payments Purchase Agreements described below.

_Accounts Payable Management Services Agreement_

On 23 February 2015, the Platform Provider and VodafoneZiggo, among others, entered into the Accounts
Payable Management Services Agreement (as defined in Condition 1 (Definitions and Principles of
_Construction)). Under the terms of the APMSA, the Obligors, together with certain other subsidiaries of_
VodafoneZiggo that may accede to the APMSA from time to time as further described below (collectively, the
“Buyer Entities” and each a “Buyer Entity”) may upload Electronic Data Files containing details of
Receivables on to the SCF Platform to enable the purchase by the Platform Provider of such Receivables (and the
Parent Payment Obligations arising in respect thereof) from the relevant Supplier. On the Issue Date, the eligible
Buyer Entities will be Ziggo B.V., Ziggo Services B.V. (collectively, the “Non-Obligor Buyer Subsidiaries”
and each a “Non-Obligor Buyer Subsidiary”, together with VZ Financing I B.V. and VZ Financing II B.V.
(collectively, the “Obligor Subsidiaries”), the “Buyer Subsidiaries” and each a “Buyer Subsidiary”), the
Obligor Subsidiaries, and the Buyer Parent. Additional Buyer Subsidiaries may accede to the APMSA by
entering into an accession letter (substantially in form set out in the APMSA) with the Platform Provider and the
Buyer Parent, and an existing Buyer Subsidiary may cease to be a “Buyer Entity” for the purposes of the
APMSA if the Platform Provider or Buyer Parent provides written notice to such effect. Additional Obligor
Subsidiaries may become party to the APMSA either by acceding as a “Designated Buyer Subsidiary” (provided
they are specified as such in the relevant accession letter) or, with respect to an existing Non-Obligor Buyer
Subsidiary, if such Non-Obligor Buyer Subsidiary is specified in writing by the Buyer Parent to be a “Designated
Buyer Subsidiary” for purposes of the APMSA. Pursuant to the Agency and Account Bank Agreement, the Buyer
Parent will undertake to the Issuer that the Buyer Parent may notify the Platform Provider of a resignation of an
Obligor Subsidiary only if all Outstanding Amounts owed by such Obligor Subsidiary (as principal obligor) in
respect of its Assigned Receivables have been settled in accordance with the APMSA on or prior to the date of its
resignation, and the Buyer Parent will agree to promptly provide written notification of the same to the Issuer (or
the Administrator on its behalf).

From time to time, a Buyer Entity may execute an Upload and designate such uploaded Receivables as
“approved”. Each Approved Platform Receivable will initially give rise to a Parent Payment Obligation, being an
independent and primary obligation by VodafoneZiggo (on the basis described in the sections entitled
“Description of the Receivables” and “Summary of Principal Documents—Accounts Payable Management
_Services Agreement” included elsewhere in this Offering Circular) to make payment or cause payment of the_
Certified Amount (as defined below) to be made to the relevant recipient on the Confirmed Payment Date in
respect thereof. Upon each Initial Transfer (being the sale and assignment of a Parent Payment Obligation and
the applicable Receivable related thereto from the Supplier to the Platform Provider through the SCF Platform),
the relevant Parent Payment Obligation will become a Payment Obligation, pursuant to which each Obligor will
become jointly and severally liable with each other Obligor to make payment or cause payment to be made to the
relevant recipient on the Confirmed Payment Date in respect thereof. The Non-Obligor Buyer Subsidiaries will
not be liable for any Payment Obligations. The Buyer Parent has notified the Platform Provider in writing that
eligible Receivables (as further described in “Summary of Principal Documents—Accounts Payable Management
_Services Agreement” included elsewhere in this Offering Circular) may include those with a Confirmed Payment_
Date of up to 360 days from the issuance date of the relevant invoice. In respect of Initial Transfers of such
Receivables a margin of 2.20% per annum calculated on the basis of the relevant Outstanding Amounts (which
includes the Platform Provider Processing Fee) over the base rate (the “Margin”) shall be applied from the date
of the relevant Initial Transfer until the Confirmed Payment Date in respect of such Payment Obligation (and the
Receivable related thereto, solely to the extent that such Receivable has been acquired by the Platform Provider).
The base rate (being, in this case, EURIBOR with a floor of zero) is determined by the remaining tenor between
the date of the relevant transfer and the Confirmed Payment Date (i.e. between 1 and 30 days, 1 month base rate
will apply; between 31 and 60 days, 2 months base rate will apply). The applicable base rate plus the applicable
Margin are used to calculate the Applied Discount that the Platform Provider will deduct from the Certified
Amount in the case of transfer by the Platform Provider of the VFZ Account Receivable prior to the Confirmed
Payment Date, and accordingly is used in the calculation of the Purchase Price Amount for each VFZ Account
Receivable. The Margin under the APMSA may not be amended without the written consent of the Issuer, and
pursuant to the terms of the other Transaction Documents, the Issuer will agree to provide its written consent to


15


-----

any amendment of the Margin (without being required to seek the consent of the Noteholders) so long as the
obligations of the New VFZ Facilities Borrower in favour of the Issuer under Clause 11.2 (“Facility Fees”) of the
New VFZ Facilities Agreement remain in full force and effect.

Pursuant to the APMSA, the Buyer Parent and, as applicable, each Obligor Subsidiary appoints the Platform
Provider as paying agent with respect to the settlement of any VFZ Account Receivable. Settlement requires the
Buyer Parent (or, at its option, an Obligor Subsidiary) to make an electronic transfer of the Certified Amount (as
defined below) to the Platform Provider’s designated bank account on the Confirmed Payment Date, and the
Platform Provider will, in turn, transfer such Certified Amount (or part thereof as received by the Platform
Provider) to the relevant recipient (which shall be the Issuer in respect of Assigned Receivables) on the same
Confirmed Payment Date. As used herein, “Certified Amount” means, with respect to a Payment Obligation, the
Outstanding Amount of such Payment Obligation on the “Certified Amount Fixed Date”, being earliest to
occur of (i) the date of the Initial Transfer, and (ii) the date falling three Business Days prior to the Confirmed
Payment Date of that Payment Obligation. Failure by any Obligor to pay all or any part of the Certified Amount
by the Confirmed Payment Date will cause default interest to accrue on the unpaid sum at a rate of 1-month
EURIBOR (floored at zero) plus 7% per annum, until the Certified Amount has been discharged in full.

If a Buyer Entity wishes to reduce the amount of any Approved Platform Receivable for any reason
(including as a result of any lien, right of set-off, defence, claim, counterclaim, or other certain adverse claim), it
may post the amount to be deducted from such Approved Platform Receivable (each, a “Credit Note”) as an
entry in an Electronic Data File to the SCF Platform Website and such Credit Note will be allocated to the
corresponding Payment Obligation on the following Business Day. No Credit Notes may be allocated to a
Payment Obligation following the relevant Certified Amount Fixed Date. Additionally, each Buyer Entity agrees
to be responsible for the accuracy of all information submitted by them onto the SCF Platform Website in respect
of VFZ Accounts Receivable and the Buyer Parent agrees to comply with certain reporting requirements set out
in the APMSA.

Under the APMSA, each Buyer Entity represents, warrants and covenants to the Platform Provider at the
date of an Upload resulting in any Payment Obligation arising and at the date of any transfer via the SCF
Platform of a Payment Obligation and the Receivable related thereto (solely to the extent that such Receivable
has been acquired by the Platform Provider) (including each Assignment Date), as applicable, among other
things: (i) that the Approved Platform Receivable relating to each Payment Obligation meets certain criteria
under the APMSA, including (but not limited to) having a Confirmed Payment Date of no more than 360 days
from the issuance date of the relevant invoice and being denominated in an agreed currency; (ii) that the
Approved Platform Receivable is not subject to any mortgage, charge, pledge, lien, other encumbrance or other
personal right or right in rem of any third party and has, to the best of the relevant Buyer Entity’s knowledge, not
been transferred or transferred in advance; (iii) that each Payment Obligation and the Receivable related thereto
(solely to the extent that such Receivable has been acquired by the Platform Provider) is free of any adverse
claims, including any lien, right of set-off, netting, abatement, reduction, claim, defence or counterclaim; (iv) that
each Payment Obligation and Receivable related thereto (solely to the extent that such Receivable has been
acquired by the Platform Provider) can be validly transferred in accordance with the terms of the APMSA; and
(v) that each Payment Obligation will be settled by an Obligor by the payment of the relevant Certified Amount
on the relevant Confirmed Payment Date without withholding, deduction or set-off.

The APMSA also provides that the following occurrences, among others, constitute events of default,
whereupon the Platform Provider shall have the right (but not the obligation) to suspend the provision of
accounts payable management services and prohibit the creation of any further Payment Obligations (each, an
“APMSA Event of Default”): (i) breach by any Buyer Entity of any obligation or certain representations,
warranties or covenants in the APMSA, if not remedied for a period of ten days (which grace period shall not
apply if such breach relates to a financial interest of an amount in excess of €5.0 million); (ii) non-payment of
any amount due under the APMSA, including all or any part of any Certified Amount (subject to a grace period
of one Business Day in the case of principal, and three Business Days in the case of any other amount); (iii) if
any Buyer Entity is unable, deemed unable, or admits inability to pay its debts as they fall due; and (iv) any
corporate action, legal proceedings or other procedure is taken in relation to the suspension of payments,
winding-up, or dissolution of any Buyer Entity, or any composition, compromise, assignment or arrangement
with any creditor of any Buyer Entity, or the appointment of a liquidator, receiver, or other similar officer in
respect of any Buyer Entity.


16


-----

The Buyer Parent has also agreed to provide certain indemnities to the Platform Provider under the APMSA,
including (but not limited to) indemnities against any losses directly suffered for or on account of tax, reasonable
losses incurred as a direct result of any APMSA Event of Default or failure by any Buyer Entity to pay any
amount due under the APMSA, and any costs, expenses, claims or losses incurred as a result of the incorrect
calculation by any Buyer Entity of the amount of any Receivable uploaded in an Electronic Data File.

The Platform Provider may assign, transfer or deal in any other manner with any VFZ Account Receivable
that has been transferred to it, and/or all of its rights against any Buyer Entity or under the APMSA, in part or in
whole, to any third party. No Buyer Entity may so assign or transfer its respective rights and obligations under
the APMSA without the written consent of the Platform Provider, and such consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

Each of the Platform Provider and the Buyer Parent may unilaterally terminate the APMSA upon notice to
the other party, if such other party breaches a material provision of the APMSA and fails to cure such breach
within 10 days following written notice from the other party requiring them to remedy such breach. The Platform
Provider may also terminate the APMSA: (i) for any reason upon 12 months’ prior written notice to the Buyer
Parent; and (ii) immediately, upon written notice, if it becomes unlawful for the Platform Provider in any
applicable jurisdiction to perform any of its obligations thereunder. The Buyer Parent may terminate the APMSA
for any reason upon 20 Business Days’ prior written notice to the Platform Provider. Following termination of
the APMSA, the Buyer Entities will no longer be permitted to use to the SCF Platform. All rights, duties and
obligations of the parties to the APMSA with respect to the Payment Obligations posted to the SCF Platform
prior to the effective date of any termination shall survive the termination of the APMSA.

_Discounted Payments Purchase Agreements_

In conjunction with the SCF Platform, each Supplier has entered into, or will enter into, a Discounted Payments
Purchase Agreement (each based on a standard form and as defined in Condition 1 (Definitions and Principles of
_Construction)) with the Platform Provider. Upon an Upload by a Buyer Entity and the designation of such uploaded_
Receivable as “approved”, (i) the price of such Receivable is increased (in accordance with the relevant supply
contract) by adding to the initial face value of such Receivable the Applied Discount (as defined in the context of the
APMSA) (as displayed on the SCF Platform on the relevant day) calculated for the period between the date of the
Upload and the Confirmed Payment Date; and (ii) the Supplier to which such Approved Platform Receivable relates
will automatically and irrevocably offer to sell to the Platform Provider the relevant Parent Payment Obligation and the
Receivable related thereto at a discounted price (as determined by deducting from the grossed-up amount of the
relevant invoice (calculated in accordance with the relevant supply contract as described above), such Applied
Discount (as defined in the context of the APMSA) (as displayed on the SCF Platform on the relevant day), such that
the Platform Provider pays an amount equal to the original face value of such invoice owed to the Supplier). Each such
offer accepted by the Platform Provider pursuant to a Discounted Payments Purchase Agreement will result in the sale,
assignment and transfer to the Platform Provider of all of such Supplier’s rights, title and interest in and to the relevant
Parent Payment Obligation and the Receivable related thereto.

The Supplier is deemed to represent and warrant to the Platform Provider upon the date of each offer (and
the date of the relevant Initial Transfer) that, with respect to each Parent Payment Obligation (and any Receivable
related thereto, where applicable), among other things: (i) the Supplier (solely) holds the full legal and beneficial
right, title and interest in and to the relevant Parent Payment Obligation and the Receivable related thereto;
(ii) the Supplier is entitled to sell and transfer the relevant Parent Payment Obligation and the Receivable related
thereto to the Platform Provider pursuant to the terms of the relevant Discounted Payments Purchase Agreement,
and the relevant Parent Payment Obligation and the Receivable related thereto is transferred to the Platform
Provider following acceptance of the offer; (iii) no mortgage, charge, pledge, lien, other encumbrance or other
personal right or right in rem exists in relation to the relevant Parent Payment Obligation or Receivable related
thereto, and the relevant Parent Payment Obligation has not been transferred nor made subject to any mortgage,
charge, pledge, lien, or other encumbrance in advance; and (iv) the Parent Payment Obligation and the
Receivable related thereto is free of any adverse claims, including any lien, right of set-off, netting, abatement,
reduction, claim, defence or counterclaim. Following each Initial Transfer, the Platform Provider, in its capacity
as agent for the relevant Supplier, shall provide notice of such transfer to the Buyer Parent and the relevant Buyer
Subsidiary. Additionally, pursuant to the relevant Discounted Payments Purchase Agreement, any tax applicable
to the transfer from the Supplier to the Platform Provider of a Parent Payment Obligation and any Receivable
related thereto shall be solely payable by that Supplier. The Supplier also represents and warrants that upon


17


-----

payment by the Platform Provider of the outstanding amount owing under any Parent Payment Obligation to the
relevant bank account established in such Supplier’s own name on the Confirmed Payment Date, the applicable
Parent Payment Obligation shall be satisfied and the relevant Buyer Entity’s obligation to pay the Supplier for
the corresponding Receivable shall be extinguished in an amount equal to such amount paid.

Subject to the agreement of the relevant Suppliers to the standard form, each Discounted Payments Purchase
Agreement gives the Platform Provider the right, without the consent of or notice to the Supplier, to assign,
transfer, mortgage, charge or otherwise deal in any other manner with any or all of its rights and obligations
under the relevant Discounted Payments Purchase Agreement, in whole or in part (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any of the Parent Payment Obligations and Receivables related thereto purchased by the Platform Provider
thereunder). In turn, pursuant to the Framework Assignment Agreement (as described above), the Platform
Provider’s right, title and interest in and to the whole of each VFZ Account Receivable are assigned to the Issuer.
For a further description of the Discounted Payments Purchase Agreements, see “Summary of Principal
_Documents—Discounted Payments Purchase Agreements”._

**_SCF Platform Addition_**

At any time, VodafoneZiggo and the Buyer Subsidiaries may, at their option, elect to participate in an
additional online system established and administered by another Platform Provider (an “SCF Platform
**Addition”). In connection with any SCF Platform Addition, VodafoneZiggo and the Buyer Subsidiaries may**
enter into additional accounts payable management services agreements (or equivalent) and the Issuer may (and
upon request by VodafoneZiggo, shall) enter into one or more additional receivables assignment agreements (or
equivalent), pursuant to which the Issuer will purchase eligible VFZ Accounts Receivable from such additional
Platform Provider. The consent of the Noteholders will not be required for VodafoneZiggo, the Buyer
Subsidiaries and the Issuer to give effect to any SCF Platform Addition (including the modification of any
Transaction Documents to implement such SCF Platform Addition), and the Administrator will enter into any
SCF Platform Addition Documentation if the Administrator receives written confirmation (with a copy to the
Notes Trustee) from VodafoneZiggo that, in VodafoneZiggo’s determination, the entry into such SCF Platform
Addition Documentation is reasonably required to implement such SCF Platform Addition and does not
materially and adversely affect the interests of the Noteholders.

**_Other Transaction Documents_**

The following documents will be entered into in relation to the offering of the Notes: (a) the Trust Deed, (b) an
agency and account bank agreement dated the Issue Date (the “Agency and Account Bank Agreement”) between,
inter alios, the Issuer, the Notes Trustee, The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch as transfer agent (the
“Transfer Agent”, which term shall include any successor or substitute transfer agent appointed pursuant to the
terms of the Agency and Account Bank Agreement), The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch as principal
paying agent (the “Paying Agent”, which term shall include any successor, substitute or additional paying agent
appointed pursuant to the terms of the Agency and Account Bank Agreement), The Bank of New York Mellon SA/
NV Luxembourg Branch as registrar (the “Registrar”, which term shall include any successor or substitute registrar
appointed pursuant to the terms of the Agency and Account Bank Agreement), The Bank of New York Mellon,
London Branch as administrative agent (the “Administrator”, which term shall include any successor or substitute
administrative agent appointed pursuant to the terms of the Agency and Account Bank Agreement), The Bank of
New York Mellon, London Branch as the Issuer transaction account bank (the “Account Bank”, which term shall
include any successor or substitute account bank appointed pursuant to the terms of the Agency and Account Bank
Agreement), and (c) an Issuer Management Agreement dated on or prior to the Issue Date, (the “Issuer
**Management Agreement”) between the Issuer and TMF Management B.V., as managing director (the “Managing**
**Director”, which term shall include any successor or substitute managing director of the Issuer in accordance with**
the terms of the Issuer Management Agreement). The Transfer Agent, Registrar, Paying Agent, Account Bank and
Administrator are herein referred to collectively as the “Agents”.

The Notes are senior obligations of the Issuer and will be secured by the Notes Collateral for, inter alia, the
Notes created by the Trust Deed and the other Notes Security Documents.

The Conditions include summaries of, and are subject to, the detailed provisions of the Trust Deed, the
Agency and Account Bank Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. If there is any conflict between the
Conditions and the Trust Deed, the Conditions shall prevail.


18


-----

The Noteholders and all persons claiming through them or under the Notes are entitled to the benefit of, and
are bound by, the Trust Deed, the Agency and Account Bank Agreement and the other Transaction Documents,
physical and/or electronic copies of which are available for inspection during usual business hours on any week
day (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays) at the offices of the Paying Agent and at the registered
office of the Issuer.

The issue of the Notes was authorised by resolution of the Board of Directors of the Issuer passed on
22 October 2019.

**Recent Developments of VodafoneZiggo**

**_Handset Securitization_**

On 12 August 2019 we completed a handset securitization financing (the “Handset Securitization
**Facility”) that enabled us to redeem the outstanding amount of the 2024 Senior Notes (together, the “August**
**2019 Refinancing”). In connection with this handset securitization financing, we established a note issuance**
programme which allowed us to issue three series of notes (secured by certain of our receivables) and which will
enable us to issue notes from time to time in multiple series in the future, all of which will be secured by certain
assets held by the Group.

**_Financing Transactions_**

_Existing Credit Facility_

Concurrently with, on or shortly after the offering of the Notes hereby, we may undertake a potential
issuance of, or extension of one or more term loans under the Existing Credit Facility (“Additional Term
**Loan”). The proceeds will be used to finance general corporate and/or working capital purposes, including,**
without limitation, the redemption, refinancing, repayment or prepayment of existing indebtedness of the Group.
The launch and funding of the Additional Term Loan and use of proceeds thereof are, collectively, the “Term
**Loan Refinancing”. On 13 October 2019, each of the lenders under our revolving credit facility consented to an**
extension of the maturity date of our revolving credit facility available under the Existing Credit Facility (the
“Extended RCF”) such that the revolving facility matures on 31 January 2026. In connection with the
Additional Term Loan or the Extended RCF, we may amend certain terms or restate the Existing Credit
Agreement. Any incurrence of indebtedness in connection with the Additional Term Loan or the Extended RCF,
will comply with the covenants thereunder. No assurance can be given that the Additional Term Loan will be
established, or if established, what the final terms will be, including the amount raised thereunder. Any amounts
raised under the Additional Term Loan and any amount drawn under the Extended RCF will constitute senior
secured debt.

_2019 Offering_

On 17 October 2019, Ziggo B.V. entered into a purchase agreement for the sale of $500.0 million of its
4.875% senior secured notes due 2030 and €425.0 million of its 2.875% senior secured notes due 2030 with the
certain initial purchasers party thereto, the net proceeds of which are expected to be used to (i) finance the 2020
Senior Secured Notes Redemption, (ii) finance the 2025 Senior Secured Notes Redemption, (iii) finance the
repayment of any other senior secured indebtedness, or (iv) for general corporate purposes, which may include
loans, distributions or other payments to other members of the Group (collectively, the “2019 Offering”). There
can be no assurance that the 2019 Offering will be consummated on the terms described above or at all. The 2019
Offering together with the Term Loan Refinancing and the August 2019 Refinancing are herein referred to as the
“Financing Transactions”.

_Potential Financing Transactions_

VodafoneZiggo continually evaluates different financing alternatives and may decide to enter into new
credit facilities, access the debt capital markets or incur other indebtedness or enter into liability management
transactions from time to time, including following the pricing of this offering and prior to, or within a short time
period following, the Issue Date (the “Potential Financing Transactions”). The cash proceeds of any Potential
Financing Transactions may be used to refinance indebtedness or for general corporate purposes. The issuance of
indebtedness under any such Potential Financing Transactions would be incurred in compliance with the
applicable covenants under the New VFZ Facilities Agreement, the Existing Credit Facility and the indentures
governing the Existing Notes. After giving effect to any such incurrence in compliance with the applicable


19


-----

covenants, including in connection with permitted refinancing debt, permitted acquisition debt or other
exceptions to the restriction on our ability to incur indebtedness, the ratio of as adjusted total covenant senior net
debt to annualized EBITDA and the ratio of as adjusted total covenant net debt to annualized EBITDA could
increase above the ratio of as adjusted total covenant senior net debt to annualized EBITDA and the ratio of as
adjusted total covenant net debt to annualized EBITDA, respectively, as of 30 June 2019 (each as shown under
the heading “Summary Financial and Operating Data of VodafoneZiggo—Certain As Adjusted Covenant
_Information”), and such increase could be material. Any Potential Financing Transaction will be made at_
VodafoneZiggo’s election or the election of its relevant subsidiaries, and, if such debt is in the form of securities,
such debt would be offered and sold pursuant to, and on the terms described in, a separate Offering Circular or
liability management document. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Financial Profile—We may incur
_additional indebtedness prior to, or within a short time period following, the Issue Date of the Notes, which_
_indebtedness could increase our leverage and may have terms that are more or less favourable than the terms of_
_the Notes and our other existing indebtedness”._

Other Subsidiaries

(1) The Notes will be limited recourse and senior obligations of the Issuer. The Notes will be secured by the
Notes Collateral. Other than under the limited circumstances described in the Offering Circular, Noteholders
will not have a direct claim on the cash flow or assets of VodafoneZiggo and its subsidiaries, and
VodafoneZiggo and its subsidiaries will have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due
under the Notes, or to make funds available to the Issuer for those payments, other than the obligations of
(i) the Obligors to make payments to the Issuer in respect of the Assigned Receivables, (ii) the Obligors to
make payments to the Issuer in respect of the New VFZ Facilities Agreement, or (iii) VZ Financing I B.V. to
make payments to the Issuer under the Expenses Agreement, and in each case of (i) to (iii) above, any
agreements related thereto to which they are party. On or following the Issue Date, the net proceeds of the
issuance of the Notes plus any upfront payments payable by the New VFZ Facilities Borrower under the New
VFZ Facilities Agreement, will be used by the Issuer to finance the purchase of VFZ Accounts Receivable
pursuant to the Framework Assignment Agreement. It is expected that the Issuer will complete its initial
purchases of new and existing VFZ Accounts Receivable by 31 March 2020. To the extent that there are not
sufficient VFZ Accounts Receivable available for purchase on the first Value Date falling on or after the
Issue Date, the Issuer will advance any excess proceeds from the issuance of the Notes to the New VFZ
Facilities Borrower as Excess Cash Loans under the Excess Cash Facility pursuant to the New VFZ Facilities
Agreement. On the Issue Date, the Issuer will also fund an Issue Date Facility Loan, in a principal amount
equal to the Subscription Proceeds under the Issue Date Facility to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower,
pursuant to the New VFZ Facilities Agreement.
(2) Legal title to the Shares in the Issuer is held by the Foundation. See “Description of the Issuer”.


21


-----

(3) The New VFZ Facilities Borrower, the Issuer and the Foundation will enter into the Issue Date
Arrangements Agreement pursuant to which the New VFZ Facilities Borrower will agree to pay the
Foundation an amount representing the Subscription Proceeds and Subscriber Profit in return for the
Foundation procuring that the Issuer enters into certain Transaction Documents in connection with the
offering of the Notes. Such payment will be conditional on the Foundation subscribing for the Issue Date
Shares, which the Issuer will allot and issue to the Foundation on the Issue Date. The Issuer will lend the
Subscription Proceeds from the Issue Date Shares to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower as an Issue Date
Facility Loan under the Issue Date Facility. In practice, the process will be almost cashless, as nearly all of
the payment by the New VFZ Facilities Borrower to the Foundation will ultimately be lent back to the
New VFZ Facilities Borrower as an Issue Date Facility Loan.
(4) The New VFZ Facilities made available pursuant to the New VFZ Facilities Agreement include the Excess
Cash Facility, the Interest Facility and the Issue Date Facility. The New VFZ Facilities Agreement also
provides certain Shortfall Payments to the Issuer by the New VFZ Facilities Borrower, and certain Excess
Arrangement Payments to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower by the Issuer. Additionally, on the Issue Date,
pursuant to the Expenses Agreement and the New VFZ Facilities Agreement, the New VFZ Facilities
Borrower will pay to the Issuer an upfront payment in an amount equal to any underwriting fees,
commissions and/or certain expenses incurred by the Issuer in relation to the issuance of the Notes. See
“Summary of Principal Documents—New VFZ Facilities Agreement”.
(5) VZ Financing I B.V. (the “New VFZ Facilities Borrower”) is the borrower under the New VFZ Facilities
Agreement and an Obligor under the SCF Platform. VodafoneZiggo (a “New VFZ Facilities Guarantor”)
is a guarantor under the New VFZ Facilities Agreement and an Obligor under the SCF Platform. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—The right of the Issuer to receive payments from the Obligors in_
_respect of the Assigned Receivables and under the Framework Assignment Agreement, the New VFZ_
_Facilities Agreement, the Expenses Agreement and the related agreements, as applicable, is effectively_
_subordinated to the rights of existing and future secured creditors of such Obligors.” Each of VZ_
Financing I B.V. and VodafoneZiggo have entered into the APMSA (pursuant to which each of the New
VFZ Facilities Borrower and VodafoneZiggo will provide a joint and several payment undertaking (as
further described in “Summary of Principal Documents—Accounts Payable Management Services
_Agreement”)), and VodafoneZiggo will, on the Issue Date, also enter into the Framework Assignment_
Agreement to provide certain representations and warranties on behalf of the Obligors to the Issuer (as
further described in “Summary of Principal Documents—Framework Assignment Agreement”).
(6) The Obligors are each a guarantor or borrower, as applicable, under the New VFZ Facilities Agreement
and will each be jointly and severally liable for the Payment Obligation component of each VFZ Account
Receivable, as further described below. On the Issue Date, the Obligors will include VodafoneZiggo, VZ
Financing I B.V. and VZ Financing II B.V.
(7) Under the terms of the APMSA, the Buyer Entities may upload Electronic Data Files containing details of
Receivables payable to a Supplier on to the SCF Platform to enable the purchase by the Platform Provider
of such Receivables (and the Parent Payment Obligations arising in respect thereof) from the relevant
Supplier. On the Issue Date, the Buyer Entities will include VodafoneZiggo, VZ Financing I B.V., VZ
Financing II B.V., Ziggo B.V. and Ziggo Services B.V. Additional Buyer Subsidiaries may accede to the
APMSA by entering into an accession letter (substantially in form set out in the APMSA) with the
Platform Provider and the Buyer Parent, and an existing Buyer Subsidiary may cease to be a “Buyer
Entity” for the purposes of the APMSA if the Platform Provider or Buyer Parent provides written notice to
such effect. See “Summary of Principal Documents—Accounts Payable Management Services Agreement”.
(8) The SCF Platform is the online system pursuant to which the Obligors may upload Receivables. The SCF
Platform is managed by the Platform Provider and is administered under the terms of the APMSA and the
Discounted Payments Purchase Agreements to facilitate vendor financing provided by the Platform Provider
and other participating funding providers, including the Issuer. Pursuant to the APMSA, the uploading of an
Electronic Data File containing details of a Receivable payable to a Supplier on to the SCF Platform, and the
designation of such uploaded Receivable as “approved” by a Buyer Entity, will initially give rise to a Parent
Payment Obligation, an independent and primary obligation by VodafoneZiggo to make payment or cause
payment to be made to the relevant recipient on the Confirmed Payment Date in respect of such Receivable.
Upon each sale and assignment of a Parent Payment Obligation and the related Receivable from the Supplier
to the Platform Provider through the SCF Platform, each Obligor will become jointly and severally liable with
each other Obligor to make payment or cause payment to be made to the relevant recipient on the Confirmed
Payment Date in respect of such Parent Payment Obligation (such Parent Payment Obligation, as enhanced
by the joint and several undertaking of each Obligor, being a Payment Obligation). See “Description of the
_Receivables—Uploading of Receivables onto the SCF Platform and Purchase by the Platform Provider: the_
_Accounts Payable Management Services Agreement”._


22


-----

(9) Under the Framework Assignment Agreement, from time to time commencing on the Issue Date, the Issuer
may purchase and have assigned to it on a non-recourse basis, up to the total amount of Committed
Principal Proceeds and the Platform Provider may sell and assign on a non-recourse basis, eligible VFZ
Accounts Receivable that are made available by Suppliers and uploaded by the Buyer Entities to the SCF
Platform. Each VFZ Account Receivable is a Payment Obligation which has been acquired by the Platform
Provider (and the Receivable in respect of which such Payment Obligation has arisen, solely to the extent
that such Receivable has been acquired by the Platform Provider). See “Description of the Receivables—
_Assignment of the VFZ Accounts Receivable by the Platform Provider to the Issuer: the Framework_
_Assignment Agreement”._
(10) Prior to the service of an Obligor Enforcement Notification, the Platform Provider will act as collection
agent for the Issuer in respect of any Collected Amounts received or recovered relating to Assigned
Receivables. Pursuant to the APMSA, the Platform Provider also acts as paying agent for the Obligors with
respect to the settlement of any VFZ Account Receivable.
(11) The Existing Senior Notes issued by (or assumed by) Ziggo Bond Company comprise (i) €400.0 million
aggregate original principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due 2025 (including €550.0 million aggregate
original principal amount of additional notes issued on 17 May 2019), with an aggregate principal amount
outstanding of €950.0 million as of 30 June 2019 (including €550.0 million aggregate original principal
amount of additional notes issued on 17 May 2019; (ii) $400.0 million (€352.2 million equivalent)
aggregate original principal amount of 5.875% senior notes due 2025, with an aggregate principal amount
outstanding of $400.0 million as of 30 June 2019 and (iii) $625.0 million (€550.2 million equivalent)
aggregate original principal amount of 6.000% senior notes due 2027, with an aggregate principal amount
outstanding of $625.0 million as of 30 June 2019. See “Description of Other Indebtedness of
_VodafoneZiggo—Notes”._

(a) OCF is the primary measure used by our chief operating decision maker and management to evaluate the
operating performance of our businesses. OCF is also a key factor that is used by our internal decision makers
to (i) determine how to allocate resources and (ii) evaluate the effectiveness of our management for purposes
of annual and other incentive compensation plans. As we use the term, OCF is defined as operating income
before depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, related-party fees and allocations, provisions
and provision releases related to significant litigation and impairment, restructuring and other operating items.
Other operating items include (a) gains and losses on the disposition of long-lived assets, (b) third-party costs
directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions, including legal, advisory
and due diligence fees, as applicable, and (c) other acquisition-related items, such as gains and losses on the
settlement of contingent consideration. Our internal decision makers believe OCF is a meaningful measure
because it represents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance that is unaffected by our
capital structure and allows management to (1) readily view operating trends, (2) perform analytical
comparisons and benchmarking between entities and (3) identify strategies to improve operating performance.
We believe our OCF measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our
performance with the performance of other companies in the same or similar industries, although our measure
may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other public companies. OCF should be viewed as
a measure of operating performance that is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, operating income, net
earnings or loss, cash flow from operating activities and other U.S. GAAP measures of income or cash flows.
A reconciliation of operating income to OCF is as follows:

**Certain As Adjusted Covenant Information:**

Ratio of as adjusted total covenant net debt to annualized EBITDA [(1)(2)(3)] . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4.80x

(1) Annualized EBITDA is calculated by multiplying “Consolidated EBITDA” (as defined in the New VFZ
Facilities Agreement in Annex A of this Offering Circular) for the six months ended 30 June 2019
(€963.3 million) by two. The definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” differs from the definition of
“Consolidated EBITDA” and “EBITDA” under certain of the indentures governing the Existing Notes.
(2) If the Committed Principal Proceeds are not fully utilized in the purchase of VZF Accounts Receivable, as
adjusted total covenant senior net debt and as adjusted total covenant net debt will increase accordingly.
Should the full amount of the Committed Principal Proceeds be so unutilized, the ratio of as adjusted total
covenant senior net debt to annualized EBITDA would equal 3.84x and the ratio of as adjusted total
covenant net debt to annualized EBITDA would equal 5.01x, in each case, as of 30 June 2019.

(3) As adjusted total covenant senior net debt and as adjusted total covenant net debt are calculated in
accordance with the “Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio” (as defined in the New VFZ Facilities Agreement
in Annex A of this Offering Circular) and are adjusted to reflect (i) the 2019 Offering and (ii) the anticipated
borrowings under the Issue Date Facility Loan under the Issue Date Facility on or shortly following the
Issue Date. As adjusted total covenant senior net debt and as adjusted total covenant net debt presented here
differ from the calculation of “Indebtedness” under the “Consolidated Leverage Ratio” and “Leverage
Ratio”, as applicable, under certain of the indentures governing the Existing Notes. The amounts shown,
which, if applicable, take into account currency swaps but do not include premiums or discounts, differ from
the debt figures that are reported under “Capitalization” in this Offering Circular. After giving effect to any
incurrence of indebtedness in connection with a Potential Financing Transaction in compliance with the
applicable covenants, including in connection with permitted refinancing debt, permitted acquisition debt or
other exceptions to the restriction on our ability to incur indebtedness, the ratio of as adjusted total covenant
senior net debt to annualized EBITDA and the ratio of as adjusted total covenant net debt to annualized
EBITDA could increase above the ratio of as adjusted total covenant senior net debt to annualized EBITDA
and the ratio of as adjusted total covenant net debt to annualized EBITDA, respectively, as of 30 June 2019
(each as shown above), and such increase could be material. See “Risk Factors— Risks Relating to Our
_Financial Profile—We may incur additional indebtedness prior to, or within a short time period following,_
_the Issue Date of the Notes, which indebtedness could increase our leverage and may have terms that are_
_more or less favorable than the terms of the Notes and our other existing indebtedness.”_

**Form and Denomination . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes will be issued in registered form. The Notes will be
represented by global notes or certificates in fully registered form
without interest coupons to be deposited with and registered in the
name of a common depository, for the accounts of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream.

The Notes will have a minimum authorized denomination of
€100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof.

**Eligible Purchasers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes are being offered hereby to investors who satisfy all of the
following criteria: (A) non-U.S. persons (with the meaning of
Regulation S), who are also not “U.S. persons” (within the meaning
of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules) (such persons, “Eligible Non-U.S.
**Persons”) in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S; (B)**
persons other than retail investors in the European Economic Area,
each defined as a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as
defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer
within the meaning of the IDD, where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1)
of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the
Prospectus Regulation); and (C) non-residents of Canada.

**ERISA . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes are not eligible for purchase by or using the assets of a
Benefit Plan Investor or any other employee benefit plan (as defined
in Section 3(3) of ERISA) which is subject to Similar Laws.

**Risk Retention Undertaking . . . . . . . . .** When applicable, the U.S. Risk Retention Rules generally require the
“securitizer” of a “securitization transaction” to retain at least 5 percent
of the “credit risk” of “securitized assets”, as such terms are defined for
purposes of that statute. Risk retention is not required if the securities
issued are not asset-backed securities or if asset-backed securities can
be offered in accordance with the foreign safe harbour under the U.S.
Risk Retention Rules for transactions that have a limited nexus to the
United States. No person involved in the offering of the Notes intends
to hold interests that would qualify as risk retention interests under the
U.S. Risk Retention Rules. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to
_Regulatory Initiatives—U.S. risk retention requirements”._

**Status and Priority . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes constitute direct and, upon issue, unconditional obligations of
the Issuer subject to the Trust Deed and the Conditions, and will be
secured by the Notes Collateral. The Notes are the obligations solely of
the Issuer and not obligations of, or guaranteed by, any of the other
parties to the Transaction Documents. The Notes rank pari passu without
preference or priority among themselves. Certain other obligations of the
Issuer rank in priority to the Notes in accordance with the Priorities of
Payment. See Condition 3 (“Status, Priority and Security”).

The Notes Trustee will not accede to the Group Priority Agreement or
the Holdco Priority Agreement and the Noteholders will not be bound
by the terms of these intercreditor arrangements.

**Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The proceeds of the issuance of the Notes will be used to purchase
VFZ Accounts Receivable pursuant to the Framework Assignment
Agreement and to fund advances to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower
under the New VFZ Facilities Agreement, as further described below,
and in “General Description of VodafoneZiggo’s Business, the Issuer
_and the Offering—Overview of the Structure of the Offering of the_
_Notes”. See also “Use of Proceeds”._

-----

On or following the Issue Date, the net proceeds of the issuance of the
Notes plus any upfront payments payable by the New VFZ Facilities
Borrower under the New VFZ Facilities Agreement, will be used by
the Issuer to finance the purchase of VFZ Accounts Receivable
pursuant to the Framework Assignment Agreement. It is expected that
the Issuer will complete its initial purchases of new and existing VFZ
Accounts Receivable by 31 March 2020. To the extent that there are
not sufficient VFZ Accounts Receivable available for purchase on the
first Value Date falling on or after the Issue Date, the Issuer will
advance any excess proceeds from the issuance of the Notes to the
New VFZ Facilities Borrower as Excess Cash Loans under the Excess
Cash Facility pursuant to the New VFZ Facilities Agreement. On the
Issue Date, the Issuer will also fund an Issue Date Facility Loan in a
principal amount equal to the Subscription Proceeds under the Issue
Date Facility to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower pursuant to the
New VFZ Facilities Agreement.

**Withholding Tax . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Payments on the Notes will be made without withholding or
deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes or other
governmental charges in any taxing jurisdiction, except to the extent
required by applicable law. If withholding or deduction for such taxes
is required by certain relevant jurisdictions to be made with respect to
a payment on the Notes the Issuer will pay, subject to certain
exceptions, any Additional Amounts (as defined in Condition 9
(“Taxation”)) necessary so that the amount a Noteholder receives
after the withholding or deduction is not less than the amount that
would have been received in the absence of such withholding or
deduction. See Condition 9 (“Taxation”).

**Interest Rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** %

**Interest Accrual Period and Basis of**
**Accrual . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Interest will accrue from the Issue Date, will be payable semiannually in arrears and will be computed on the basis of a 360-day
year comprising twelve 30-day months.

**Interest Payment Dates . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Interest will be paid to Noteholders on 15 April and 15 October of
each year, commencing on 15 April 2020 or, if any such day is not a
Business Day, the next succeeding day which is a Business Day.

**Business Day . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** For the purposes of any payment to be made on the Notes, “Business
Day” or “business day” means each day that is not a Saturday,
Sunday or other day on which banking institutions in Amsterdam,
The Netherlands, New York, U.S.A., or London, England are

**Early Redemption Event . . . . . . . . . . .** Subject to certain conditions, on or prior to 30 days after the Issue Date
and following the determination of VodafoneZiggo that the Issuer is
required to be consolidated into the financial statements of the Group,
the Issuer may redeem all, but not some, of the Notes at a price equal to
100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest
to the applicable redemption date as further described in Condition 6(f)
(“Redemption, _Purchase_ _and_ _Cancellation;_ _Approved_ _Exchange_
_Offer—Early Redemption Event”). See “Risk Factors—General Risks—_
_VodafoneZiggo may be required to consolidate the Issuer into its_
_consolidated financial statements and the Notes may be redeemed on or_
_before 30 days after the Issue Date”._

**Early Redemption: Tax Event . . . . . . .** Subject to certain conditions (including, among other things, that any
and all remaining Assigned Receivables are repaid by the Obligors, or
assigned or agreed to be assigned by the Issuer to another person,
prior to the date of redemption and that all amounts lent to the New
VFZ Facilities Borrower under the New VFZ Facilities Agreement
are repaid to the Issuer prior to the date of redemption pursuant to
Clause 7.2(a) (“Voluntary Prepayment”)), the Issuer will, upon giving
notice to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower that a Tax Event (as
defined in Condition 1 (“Definitions and Principles of Construction—
_General Interpretation”)) which cannot be cured has occurred or will_
occur, redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at their principal
amount, together with interest and other amounts (including
Additional Amounts), if any, accrued to the applicable redemption
date. See Condition 6(b) (“Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation;
_Approved Exchange Offer—Early Redemption: Tax Event”)._

**Early Redemption: Illegality . . . . . . . .** Subject to certain conditions (including, among other things, that any
and all remaining Assigned Receivables are repaid by the Obligors, or
assigned or agreed to be assigned by the Issuer to another person, prior
to the date of redemption and that all amounts lent to the New VFZ
Facilities Borrower under the New VFZ Facilities Agreement are
repaid to the Issuer prior to the date of redemption), the Issuer will
redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, upon giving
prior notice, if it becomes unlawful in any applicable jurisdiction for
the Issuer to be a lender or to perform any of its obligations under the
New VFZ Facilities Agreement. If the Issuer exercises such redemption
right, it must pay to Noteholders a price equal to the principal amount
of the Notes plus interest and other amounts (including Additional
Amounts), if any, accrued to the applicable redemption date. See
Condition 6(c) (“Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation; Approved
_Exchange Offer—Early Redemption: Illegality”)._

**Accelerated Maturity Event . . . . . . . . .** Following a Change of Control (as defined under the New VFZ
Facilities Agreement), the New VFZ Facilities Borrower will be
required to offer to prepay the New VFZ Facilities Loans. Following
receipt of such prepayment offer, the Issuer will launch a consent
solicitation to set (i) the Maturity Date of the Notes as the New
Maturity Date (as defined in Condition 1 (“Definitions and Principles
_of Construction—General Interpretation”)) and (ii) the redemption_
price of the Notes on the New Maturity Date at 101% of the principal
amount of the Notes (“Accelerated Redemption Price”), plus
accrued and unpaid interest to the New Maturity Date, in accordance
with Condition 6(g) (“Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation;
_Approved_ _Exchange_ _Offer—Accelerated_ _Maturity_ _Event”)_ and
Additional Amounts, if any. If holders of more than 50% of the
aggregate principal amount of Notes consent to the foregoing
requests, the Issuer will inform the New VFZ Facilities Borrower that


34


-----

it accepts the prepayment offer, and the New VFZ Facilities Borrower
will prepay the New VFZ Facility Loans at par, plus accrued and
unpaid interest thereon, together with a payment equal to 1% of the
principal amount of the Excess Cash Loans and Interest Facility
Loans so prepaid. Following such prepayment, the Issuer will redeem
all of the Notes on the New Maturity Date at the Accelerated
Redemption Price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the New
Maturity Date and Additional Amounts, if any. See Conditions 6(g),
6(h) and 6(i) (“Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation; Approved
_Exchange Offer—Accelerated Maturity Event”)._

**Approved Exchange Offer . . . . . . . . . .** In order to extend the availability of the committed financing for the
purchase of VFZ Accounts Receivable represented by the Committed
Principal Proceeds (as defined in “General _Description_ _of_
_VodafoneZiggo’s Business, the Issuer and the Offering—Overview of_
_the Structure of the Offering of the Notes”) beyond the Maturity Date of_
the Notes, VodafoneZiggo and the New VFZ Facilities Borrower may,
at any time, enter into an exchange offer and vendor financing plan
agreement (a “Plan Agreement”) with a new entity (a “New Issuer”).
Pursuant to any such Plan Agreement, the New Issuer will procure from
the New VFZ Facilities Borrower a commitment to cancel amounts of
the New VFZ Facilities, and will enter into agreements with
VodafoneZiggo, the New VFZ Facilities Borrower, the Platform
Provider, the Notes Trustee and other relevant counterparties providing
for the New Issuer’s purchase of VFZ Accounts Receivable on terms
and conditions substantially similar to the Transaction Documents.

Promptly after entering into the Plan Agreement, the New Issuer will
launch an exchange offer (the “Approved Exchange Offer”) designed to
allow Noteholders to exchange up to a specified principal amount of
Notes for a principal amount of New Notes to be set out in the Approved
Exchange Offer. The aggregate principal amount of New Notes to be
issued, the selection of Assigned Receivables to be assigned by the Issuer
to the New Issuer, the aggregate principal amount of Interest Facility
Loans and Excess Cash Loans to be prepaid by the New VFZ Facilities
Borrower, and the Accrued Facility Interest and Shortfall Amount (as
defined elsewhere in this Offering Circular) to be paid by the Issuer to the
New Issuer, each in connection with the Approved Exchange Offer, will
be determined as described in Conditions 6(k) and 6(l) (“Redemption,
_Purchase and Cancellation; Approved Exchange Offer—Approved_
_Exchange Offer”). Additionally, the consummation of the Approved_
Exchange Offer will be subject to the conditions set out in the Trust Deed.

**Initial Maturity Date . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** 31 January 2024.

**Notes Collateral . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes will be secured by: (i) a first fixed charge over the Issuer’s
rights, title, benefit and interest in, to and under the Assigned
Receivables; (ii) an assignment by way of security over the Issuer’s
rights under all contracts, agreements, deeds and documents to which
it is or may become a party or in respect of which it has or may have
any right, title, benefit or interest (including, without limitation, the
New VFZ Facilities Agreement, the Expenses Agreement, the
Framework Assignment Agreement, and the Issue Date Arrangements
Agreement); (iii) a first fixed charge over the Issuer’s rights to all
amounts at any time standing to the credit of the Issuer Transaction
Accounts; and (iv) a first floating charge over all of the present and
future property, assets and undertakings of the Issuer not subject to
the fixed charges or assignments by way of security described above.

**Limited Recourse . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes will be the limited recourse obligations of the Issuer. None
of VodafoneZiggo nor any of its subsidiaries will guarantee or provide
any security or any other credit support to the Issuer with respect to its
obligations under the Notes. Other than in the limited circumstances
described herein, Noteholders will not have a direct claim on the cash
flow or assets of VodafoneZiggo or any of its subsidiaries, and neither
VodafoneZiggo nor any of its subsidiaries has any obligation,
contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due under the Notes, or to
make funds available to the Issuer for those payments, other than the
obligations of (i) the Obligors to make payments to the Issuer in respect
of the Assigned Receivables, (ii) the Obligors to make payments to the
Issuer in respect of the New VFZ Facilities Agreement, or (iii) VF
Financing I B.V. to make payments to the Issuer under the Expenses
Agreement and, in each case of (i) to (iii) above, any agreements
related thereto to which such Obligor is party.

**Listing and Admission to Trading . . . .** Application will be made for the Notes to be listed on the Official List
of Euronext Dublin and to be admitted for trading on the Global
Exchange Market thereof, which is not a regulated market (pursuant
to the provisions of Directive 2004/39/EC). It is anticipated that
listing will take place as soon as practicable after the Issue Date.
There can be no assurance that such listing will be granted. See
“Listing and General Information”.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may, at its sole option at
any time, without the consent of Noteholders or the Notes Trustee,
de-list the Notes, for the purposes of moving the listing of such Notes
to The International Stock Exchange. See Condition 25 (“Listing”).

**ISIN/Common Code Number . . . . . . . .** The Notes have been accepted for clearance through Euroclear and
Clearstream.

Date or the date of early redemption of the Notes in accordance with
Condition 6 (“Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation; Approved
_Exchange Offer”), without the consent of Noteholders, issue Further_
Notes in accordance with Condition 20 (“Issue of Further Notes”) and
the provisions of the Trust Deed.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves risks. Before purchasing the Notes, you should consider carefully the_
_specific risk factors set forth below, as well as the other information contained in this Offering Circular, as well_
_as the other information contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this Offering Circular. If any of the_
_events described below, individually or in combination, were to occur, this could have a material adverse impact_
_on the Issuer’s and VodafoneZiggo’s business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition and could_
_therefore have a negative effect on the trading price of the Notes and the ability of VodafoneZiggo and/or the_
_Obligor Subsidiaries, as applicable, to pay all or part of any amounts payable in respect of the Assigned_
_Receivables, the New VFZ Facilities Agreement or the Expenses Agreement, and in turn, would have an adverse_
_effect on the Issuer’s ability to pay all or part of the interest or principal on the Notes. Although the risk factors_
_described below and elsewhere in this document are the risks considered to be the most material, there may be_
_other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that also could_
_have material adverse effects on the Issuer’s or VodafoneZiggo’s results of operations, financial condition,_
_business or operations in the future. In addition, past financial performance of VodafoneZiggo may not be a_
_reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in_
_future periods._

_This Offering Circular also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual_
_results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various_
_factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this Offering Circular._

_Prospective purchasers of the Notes should ensure that they understand the nature of such Notes and the_
_extent of their exposure to risk, that they have sufficient knowledge, experience and access to professional_
_advisers to make their own legal, tax, regulatory, accounting and financial evaluation of the merits and risks of_
_investment in such Notes and that they consider the suitability of such Notes as an investment in light of their_
_own circumstances and financial condition and that of any accounts for which they are acting._

_In this section, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “we”, “our”, “our company”, and “us”_
_refer to VodafoneZiggo Group B.V. and its consolidated subsidiaries. In addition, in this section only, ARPU_
_includes similar metric used by Vodafone Netherlands (Active Customer ARPU) and RGUs includes mobile_
_customers._

**General Risks**

It is intended that the Issuer will invest in VFZ Accounts Receivable and in the New VFZ Facilities Loans
and other financial assets with certain risk characteristics as described below. There can be no assurance that the
Issuer’s investments will be successful, that its investment objectives will be achieved, that the Noteholders will
receive the full amounts payable by the Issuer under the Notes or that they will receive any return on their
investment in the Notes. Prospective investors are advised to review this entire Offering Circular carefully and
should consider, among other things, the risk factors set out in this section before deciding whether to invest in
the Notes. None of the Initial Purchasers or the Notes Trustee undertakes to review the financial condition or
affairs of the Issuer during the life of the arrangements contemplated by this Offering Circular nor to advise any
investor or potential investor in the Notes of any information coming to the attention of the Initial Purchasers or
the Notes Trustee which is not included in this Offering Circular.

**_VodafoneZiggo may be required to consolidate the Issuer into its consolidated financial statements and the_**
**_Notes may be redeemed on or before 30 days after the Issue Date_**

The issuer has been formed as an unaffiliated special purpose financing company for the primary purpose of
facilitating the offering of the Notes. The Group believes that VodafoneZiggo has no variable interest in the
Issuer and no ability to control the Issuer and therefore will not consolidate the Issuer into the consolidated
financial statements of VodafoneZiggo. Following the Issue Date, if it is determined that Vodafone Ziggo does
have a variable interest in the Issuer and/or an ability to control Issuer, VodafoneZiggo will consolidate the Issuer
into its consolidated financial statements. Although the Issuer will not be (and will not be deemed to be) a
subsidiary of VodafoneZiggo for the purposes of the covenants under the New VFZ Facilities Agreement (and
therefore not subject to the restrictions set out in the covenants under the New VFZ Facilities Agreement), the
consolidated financial statements would treat the Issuer as a subsidiary of VodafoneZiggo and any transactions
deemed to be intercompany within the consolidated group would be eliminated. These eliminations may include
presenting the Notes as if they were issued directly by the Group and the elimination of amounts outstanding

37


-----

under the New VFZ Facilities Agreement and any Assigned Receivables. In addition, if it is determined that the
Issuer is required to be consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of the Group, all of the Notes may
be redeemed on or prior to the date that is 30 days following the Issue Date. See Condition 6(f) (Redemption,
_Purchase and Cancellation; Approved Exchange Offer—Early Redemption Event)._

**_Business and regulatory risks for vehicles of the Issuer’s nature_**

Legal, tax and regulatory changes could occur over the course of the life of the Notes that may adversely
affect the Issuer. The regulatory environment for vehicles of the nature of the Issuer is evolving, and changes in
regulation may adversely affect the value of investments held by the Issuer and the ability of the Issuer to obtain
the leverage it might otherwise obtain or to pursue its investment and trading strategies. In addition, the securities
and derivatives markets are subject to comprehensive statutes, regulations and margin requirements.

Certain regulators and self-regulatory organizations and exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary
actions in the event of market emergencies. The regulation of transactions of a type similar to the Transactions,
derivatives transactions and vehicles that engage in such transactions is an evolving area of law and is subject to
modification by government and judicial action. The effect of any future regulatory change on the Issuer could be
substantial and adverse.

**_Euro and Euro zone risk_**

The deterioration of the sovereign debt of several countries, together with the risk of contagion to other,
more stable, countries, has raised a number of uncertainties regarding the stability and overall standing of the
European Economic and Monetary Union and may result in changes to the composition of the Euro zone.

As a result of the credit crisis in Europe, the European Commission created the European Financial Stability
Facility (the “EFSF”) and the European Financial Stability Mechanism (the “EFSM”) to provide funding to Euro
zone countries in financial difficulties that seek such support. In March 2011, the European Council agreed on
the need for Euro zone countries to establish a permanent stability mechanism, the European Stability
Mechanism (the “ESM”), to assume the role of the EFSF and the EFSM in providing external financial
assistance to Euro zone countries from 1 July 2013 onward.

Despite these measures, concerns persist regarding the growing risk that other Euro zone countries could be
subject to an increase in borrowing costs and could face an economic crisis similar to that of Cyprus, Greece,
Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, together with the risk that some countries, such as the U.K. (following its
referendum on 23 June 2016) could leave the E.U. and/or the Euro zone (either voluntarily or involuntarily), and
that the impact of these events on Europe and the global financial system could be severe which could have a
negative impact on VodafoneZiggo and the Notes Collateral (including, without limitation, the Assigned
Receivables). For a description of the risks associated with the U.K.’s vote to leave the E.U., see “—The U.K.
_referendum advising for the exit of the U.K. from the E.U. could have a material adverse effect on our business,_
_financial condition, results of operations or liquidity”._

Furthermore, concerns that the Euro zone sovereign debt crisis could worsen may lead to the reintroduction
of national currencies in one or more Euro zone countries or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible
dissolution of the Euro entirely. The departure or risk of departure from the Euro by one or more Euro zone
countries and/or the abandonment of the Euro as a currency could have major negative effects on the Issuer, the
Notes Collateral (including the risks of currency losses arising out of redenomination and related haircuts on any
affected areas), VodafoneZiggo and the Notes. Should the Euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual
consequences for holders of Euro-denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time.
These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect
the value of the Notes. It is difficult to predict the final outcome of the Euro zone crisis. Investors should
carefully consider how changes to the Euro zone may affect their investment in the Notes.

**Risks relating to Regulatory Initiatives**

**_Regulatory initiatives_**

In Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere there is increased political and regulatory scrutiny of banks, financial
institutions and the asset-backed securities industry. This has resulted in a raft of measures for increased
regulation which are currently at various stages of implementation and which may have an adverse impact on the

regulatory capital charge to certain investors in securitization exposures and/or the incentives for certain
investors to hold asset–backed securities, and may thereby affect the liquidity of such securities. Investors in the
Notes are responsible for analysing their own regulatory position and none of VodafoneZiggo, the Issuer, the
Initial Purchasers, the Administrator, the Obligors, the Security Trustee or the Notes Trustee nor any of their
affiliates makes any representation to any prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes regarding the impact of
such regulation on the prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes or the regulatory capital treatment of their
investment in the Notes in each case, on the Issue Date or at any time in the future.

This uncertainty is further compounded by the numerous regulatory efforts underway in Europe, the U.S.
and globally. Certain of these efforts overlap. In addition, even where these regulatory efforts overlap, they
generally have not been undertaken on a coordinated basis. Areas where divergence between regulation exists or
has begun to develop (whether with respect to scope, interpretation, timing, approach or otherwise) includes
trading, clearing and reporting requirements for derivatives transactions, higher capital and margin requirements
relating to uncleared derivatives transactions, and capital and liquidity requirements that may result in mandatory
“ring–fencing” of capital or liquidity in certain jurisdictions, among others. Investors should be aware that those
risks are material and that the Issuer and, consequently, an investment in the Notes could be materially and
adversely affected thereby.

No representation is made as to the proper characterisation of the Notes for legal investment, financial
institution regulatory, financial reporting or other purposes, as to the ability of particular investors to purchase the
Notes under applicable legal investment or other restrictions or as to the consequences of an investment in the
Notes for such purposes or under such restrictions. Certain regulatory or legislative provisions applicable to
certain investors may have the effect of limiting or restricting their ability to hold or acquire the Notes, which in
turn may adversely affect the ability of investors in the Notes who are not subject to those provisions to resell
their Notes in the secondary market.

**_Basel III_**

The regulatory capital and liquidity regime applicable to member countries of the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision (“BCBS”) (commonly referred to as “Basel III”) provides for a substantial strengthening of
prudential rules compared to the previous regulatory regime, and includes requirements intended to reinforce
capital standards (with heightened requirements for global systemically important banks), revisions to the
securitization framework, the establishment of a leverage ratio “backstop” for financial institutions and certain
minimum liquidity standards (referred to as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (“LCR”) and the Net Stable Funding
Ratio (“NSFR”)). BCBS member countries agreed to implement Basel III from 1 January 2013, subject to
transitional and phase–in arrangements for certain requirements (e.g. the LCR requirements refer to
implementation from the start of 2015, with full implementation by January 2019, and the NSFR requirements
refer to implementation from January 2018). The final rules, and the timetable for the full implementation of the
Basel III framework in each jurisdiction, as well as the treatment of asset–backed securities (e.g. as LCR eligible
assets or not), may be subject to some level of national variation. It should also be noted that changes to
regulatory capital requirements for insurance and reinsurance undertakings are also being introduced, through
initiatives such as the Solvency II framework in Europe.

Prospective investors should therefore make themselves aware of the prudential requirements described
above (and any corresponding implementing rules of their regulator), where applicable to them, in addition to
any other applicable regulatory requirements with respect to their investment in the Notes. The matters described
above and any further changes to the regulation or regulatory treatment of the Notes for some or all investors
may negatively impact the regulatory position of individual investors and, in addition, have a negative impact on
the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market.

**_U.S. risk retention requirements_**

On 21 October 2014, the final rules implementing the credit risk retention requirements of Section 941 of
the Dodd–Frank Act (as defined herein) (the “U.S. Risk Retention Rules”) were issued. The U.S. Risk Retention
Rules generally require the sponsor of a securitization to retain not less than five per cent. of the credit risk of the
assets collateralizing the issuer’s asset-backed securities (“ABS”). The U.S. Risk Retention Rules with respect to
ABS collateralized by residential mortgages became effective on 24 December 2015, and the U.S. Risk Retention
Rules with respect to all other classes of ABS became effective on 24 December 2016 (the “U.S. Risk Retention
**Effective Date”). In addition, the SEC has indicated in contexts separate from the U.S. Risk Retention Rules that**
an “offer” or a “sale” of securities may arise when amendments to securities are so material as to require holders

39


-----

to make an “investment decision” with respect to such amendment. Thus, if the SEC were to take a similar
position with respect to the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, they could apply to material amendments to this Offering
Circular and the Notes, including a re-pricing, to the extent such amendments require investors to make an
investment decision.

When applicable, the U.S. Risk Retention Rules generally require the “securitizer” of a “securitization
transaction” to retain at least five per cent of the “credit risk” of “securitized assets”, as such terms are defined
for purposes of that statute, and generally prohibit a securitizer from directly or indirectly eliminating or reducing
its credit exposure by hedging or otherwise transferring the credit risk that the securitizer is required to retain. As
discussed below, risk retention is not required if the ABS can be offered in accordance with the foreign “safe
harbor under U.S. Risk Retention Rules for transactions that have a limited nexus to the United States, provided
they satisfy certain conditions. No person involved in the offering of the Notes intends to hold interests that
would qualify as risk retention under the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, and investors will therefore not receive the
potential benefit of an alignment of interests created through risk retention interests. See “Transfer Restrictions”.

A limited exemption, or “safe harbour”, from the U.S. Risk Retention Rules exists for foreign
securitizations provided they satisfy certain conditions. One such condition is that not more than 10 per cent. of
the dollar value (or the equivalent amount in a foreign currency) of all classes of ABS interests in the
securitization are sold or transferred to U.S. persons or for the account or benefit of U.S. persons. The relevant
federal agencies have specified in their comments published with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules appearing in the
Federal Register on 24 December 2014 that the 10 per cent. limitation only applies to ABS interests sold in the
initial distribution of ABS interests; secondary sales to U.S. persons would not normally be included in the
calculation. However, secondary sales into the U.S. under circumstances that indicate that such sales were
contemplated at the time of the issuance (and not included for purposes of calculating the 10 per cent. limit)
might be viewed as part of a plan or scheme to evade the requirements of the rule and such securitization
transactions would then be unable to avail themselves of the “safe harbour”. The Initial Purchasers expect to
control the initial distribution of the Notes with the intent that the Transactions will be exempt from the U.S. Risk
Retention Rules (to the extent they might otherwise apply) pursuant to the “safe harbour”, however none of
VodafoneZiggo, the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Administrator, the Obligors, the Security Trustee or the
Notes Trustee nor any of their affiliates makes any representation regarding whether the Transactions will fall
within the “safe harbour”. Each investor in the Notes must make its own determination as to whether the “safe
harbour” applies.

As a result, the U.S. Risk Retention Rules may adversely affect the Issuer and the performance, the liquidity
and market value of the Notes if the “safe harbour” described above is found not to apply to the Transactions or if
the Issuer is unable to undertake any such additional issuance or refinancing of the Notes. Furthermore, no
assurance can be given as to whether the U.S. Risk Retention Rules would have any future material adverse
effect on the business, financial condition or prospects of the Issuer or on the market value or liquidity of the
Notes.

**_Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive_**

EU Directive 2011/61/EU on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (“AIFMD”) regulates alternative
investment fund managers (“AIFMs”) and provides that an alternative investment fund (“AIF”) within the scope
of AIFMD must have a designated AIFM responsible for ensuring compliance with AIFMD.

AIFMD provides that it shall not apply to “securitisation special purpose entities” (the “SSPE Exemption”),
which are defined by reference to securitisation within the meaning of Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No
24/2009 of the European Central Bank of 19 December 2008 (the “FVC Regulation”). The European Securities
and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) has not yet given any formal guidance on the application of the SSPE
Exemption or whether a vehicle such as the Issuer would fall within it.

If the Issuer were to constitute an AIF (because, for example, of a change in the guidance from the ESMA)
and did not fall within the SSPE Exemption then it would be necessary for the Issuer to appoint an AIFM which
would be subject to AIFMD and would need to be appropriately regulated. The AIFM would be subject to certain
duties and responsibilities in respect of the management of the Issuer’s investments, which could result in
significant additional costs and expenses being incurred which may be reimbursable by the Issuer and which may
materially adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to carry on its business, which may in turn negatively affect the
amounts payable to Noteholders.

**_U.S. Dodd-Frank Act_**

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed
into law on 21 July 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive change to financial regulation in the
United States, and affects virtually every area of the capital markets. Implementation of the Dodd–Frank Act
requires many lengthy rulemaking processes resulting in a multitude of new regulations applicable to entities
which transact business in the U.S. or with U.S. persons outside the U.S. While many regulations implementing
various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have been finalised and adopted, some implementing regulations
currently exist only in draft form and are subject to comment and revision, and still other implementing
regulations have not yet been proposed. It is therefore difficult to predict whether and to what extent the business
of the Issuer will be affected by the Dodd-Frank Act as implementing regulations are finalised over time and
come into effect.

In addition, the joint final rule implementing the U.S. Risk Retention Rules became fully effective on the
U.S. Risk Retention Effective Date, which could limit the ability of the Issuer to undertake any additional
issuance or refinancing of the Notes and may affect the liquidity of the Notes. See “U.S. Risk Retention
_Requirements” above._

The SEC had also proposed changes to Regulation AB under the U.S. Securities Act (“Regulation AB”)
which would have had the potential to impose new disclosure requirements on offerings of asset-backed
securities pursuant to Rule 144A or pursuant to other SEC regulatory exemptions from registration. On 27
August 2014, the SEC adopted final rules amending Regulation AB that did not implement these proposals;
however the SEC has indicated that it is continuing to consider amendments that were proposed with respect to
Regulation AB but not adopted, and that further amendments may be forthcoming in the future. Such
amendments, if adopted, could have restricted the use of this Offering Circular or require the publication of a
new Offering Circular in connection with the issuance and sale of any additional Notes or any refinancing thereof
and impose ongoing reporting and other compliance obligations.

As such, investors should consult their own independent advisers and make their own assessment about the
potential risks posed by the Dodd–Frank Act and the rules to be promulgated thereunder in making any
investment decision in respect of the Notes.

**_Volcker Rule_**

Section 13 of the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, together with the rules, regulations
and published guidance promulgated thereunder, as amended (known as the “Volcker Rule”) generally prohibits
“banking entities” from, among other things, acquiring or retaining an “ownership interest” in, or sponsoring or
having certain relationships with, a “covered fund”, subject to certain exclusions or exemptions from the
definition of “covered fund” or exemptions from the Volcker Rule’s covered fund-related prohibitions. For
purposes of the Volcker Rule, a “banking entity” is defined to include (i) any U.S. insured depository institution;
(ii) any company that controls a U.S. insured depository institution; (iii) any company that is treated as a bank
holding company for purposes of section 8 of the International Banking Act (i.e., a foreign bank that maintains a
branch, agency or commercial lending company subsidiary in the U.S.); and (iv) any affiliate or subsidiary of any
entity described in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii)..

The definition of “covered fund” under the Volcker Rule includes, in part, any issuer that would be an
investment company under the Investment Company Act but for exclusions provided under Section 3(c)(1) or
Section 3(c)(7) thereunder. Because the Issuer will rely on the exclusion under Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment
Company Act, it will be considered a “covered fund” for purposes of the Volcker Rule, unless it fits within an
applicable exclusion from the definition of “covered fund”. In the event the Issuer is considered a “covered
fund”, “banking entities” that are subject to the Volcker Rule may be prohibited from, among other things,
acquiring or retaining an “ownership interest” in the Issuer, unless such “banking entity” is able to rely on an
applicable exclusion or exemption under the Volcker Rule.

“Ownership interest” is defined under the Volcker Rule as “any equity, partnership, or other similar
interest.” The Notes are not equity or partnership interests. The phrase “other similar interests” is defined under
the Volcker Rule as an interest that:

(A) Has the right to participate in the selection or removal of a general partner, managing member, member
of the board of directors or trustees, investment manager, investment advisor, or commodity trading
advisor of the covered fund (excluding the rights of a creditor to exercise remedies upon the occurrence
of an event of default or an acceleration event);

41


-----

(B) Has the right under the terms of the interest to receive a share of the income, gains or profits of the
covered fund;

(C) Has the right to receive the underlying assets of the covered fund after all other interests have been
redeemed and/or paid in full (excluding the rights of a creditor to exercise remedies upon the
occurrence of an event of default or an acceleration event);

(D) Has the right to receive all or a portion of excess spread (the positive difference, if any, between the
aggregate interest payments received from the underlying assets of the covered fund and the aggregate
interest paid to the holders of other outstanding interests);

(E) Provides under the terms of the interest that the amounts payable by the covered fund with respect to
the interest could be reduced based on losses arising from the underlying assets of the covered fund,
such as allocation of losses, write-downs or charge-offs of the outstanding principal balance, or
reductions in the amount of interest due and payable on the interest;

(F) Receives income on a pass-through basis from the covered fund, or has a rate of return that is
determined by reference to the performance of the underlying assets of the covered fund; or

(G) Any synthetic right to have, receive, or be allocated any of the rights in Clauses (A) through (F) above.

On the Issue Date, pursuant to and in accordance with the Trust Deed, the Notes Trustee will be appointed
to act as a creditor representative of the Noteholders and the Security Trustee will be appointed to act as security
trustee for the Secured Parties (which will include the Noteholders). Subject to and in accordance with the terms
of the Trust Deed and the Conditions, prior to the delivery or deemed delivery of a Note Acceleration Notice
(following the occurrence of an Issuer Event of Default which is continuing) and/or an Enforcement Notice, as
applicable, the Issuer may continue to exercise its rights under the Transaction Documents (including with
respect to its assets comprising the Notes Collateral) and no Noteholder will be entitled to take (or to instruct the
Notes Trustee and/or the Security Trustee, as applicable, to take) any proceedings or other actions directly
against the Issuer, including to (i) take any corporate action or other steps or legal proceedings for the windingup, dissolution or reorganisation or for the appointment of a receiver, administrator, administrative receiver,
trustee, liquidator, sequestrator, examiner or similar officer of the Issuer or of its revenues and assets; or (ii) take
any steps for the purpose of obtaining payment of any amounts payable to it under the Notes or any Transaction
Document, and no Noteholder shall take any steps to recover any debts whatsoever owing to it by the Issuer. See
“Terms and Conditions of the Notes” and “Summary of Principal Documents—Trust Deed” included elsewhere in
this Offering Circular. These rights of the Noteholders to enforce the rights and remedies granted for the benefit
of the Noteholders under the Transaction Documents are the types of rights that are excluded from the rights that
are included in the definition of “other similar interests”.

The Noteholders have no rights under the Transaction Documents to participate in the selection or removal
of any of the types of partners, members or managers of the Issuer described in Clause (A) above. The
management of the Issuer will be governed by the terms of an issuer management agreement between the Issuer
and TMF Management B.V., an independent managing director not controlled by the Noteholders (the
“Managing Director”, which term shall include any successor or substitute managing directors of the Issuer in
accordance with the terms of the Issuer Management Agreement), pursuant to which the Managing Director
agrees to perform various management functions on behalf of the Issuer. The Foundation will hold all the
authorized, issued and fully paid up share capital of the Issuer. The Foundation is the only person with the right
to subscribe for any share capital of the Issuer, and it has the ability to elect directors of the Issuer and may be
able to take certain other actions permitted to be taken by shareholders under the articles of association of the
Issuer. The Noteholders have no rights to participate in the selection or removal of the Foundation. See
“Description of the Issuer” included elsewhere in this Offering Circular. Pursuant to the Agency and Account
Bank Agreement, the Issuer will appoint The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch to act as its portfolio
administrator, administrative agent and calculation agent under the Transaction Documents (the
“Administrator”), it being agreed that the Administrator (and each other Agent under the Agency and Account
Bank Agreement) will act solely as agent for the Issuer and will not assume any obligations towards or
relationship of agency or trust for or with any of the Noteholders.

The Noteholders have no rights under the Transaction Documents to receive a share of the income, gains or
profits of the Issuer as described in Clause (B) above, and have no rights to receive the underlying assets of the
Issuer after all other interests have been redeemed and/or paid in full (excluding the rights of a creditor to
exercise remedies upon the occurrence of an event of default or an acceleration event) as described in Clause
(C) above. The Issuer is a special purpose vehicle which, so long as any of the Notes are outstanding, will be

42


-----

subject to the restrictions set out in the Trust Deed and the Conditions. The Issuer will not have any subsidiaries
and, save in respect of the proceeds of the Issuer’s issued share capital held by the Foundation as contemplated
by the Transaction Documents (which do not comprise any part of the Notes Collateral), the Issuer will not be
able to accumulate any surpluses. The only assets of the Issuer available to meet claims of the Noteholders and
the other Secured Parties are the assets comprising the Notes Collateral, which (as described above) cannot be
enforced prior to an Enforcement Notice in accordance with the Trust Deed and the Conditions. See “Description
_of the Issuer” included elsewhere in this Offering Circular._

The Noteholders have no rights to receive any excess spread (the positive difference, if any, between the
aggregate interest payments received from the underlying assets of Issuer and the aggregate interest paid to the
Noteholders) as described in Clause (D) above. The New VFZ Facilities Agreement will provide that the Issuer
will pay or transfer any Term Excess Arrangement Payment and any Maturity Excess Payment (in each case
calculated in accordance with the Agency and Account Bank Agreement) to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower, as
a rebate of previously paid interest under the New VFZ Facilities Agreement. See “General Description of
_VodafoneZiggo’s Business, the Issuer and the Offering—Overview of the Structure of the Offering of the Notes”,_
“Summary of Principal Documents—Agency and Account Bank Agreement”, “Summary of Principal
_Documents— New VFZ Facilities Agreement” and “Annex A: New VFZ Facilities Agreement” included_
elsewhere in this Offering Circular.

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue €400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes, which will bear
interest at a fixed rate per annum equal to %, as further described elsewhere in this Offering Circular. While
the Issuer, as a special purpose vehicle, is wholly dependent on the payments it will receive in respect of the
Assigned Receivables and under the Framework Assignment Agreement, the New VFZ Facilities Agreement and
the Expenses Agreement, and a failure by any of the Obligors to provide such funding (or by the Platform
Provider in certain limited circumstances to make payments due to the Issuer under the Framework Assignment
Agreement) may, in practice, negatively impact the ability of the Issuer to meet its obligations under the
Transaction Documents (including the Notes), there are no contractual terms of the Notes under the Trust Deed
or the Conditions which provide that the amounts payable by the Issuer (whether as principal or interest) with
respect to the Notes will be reduced based on losses arising from the underlying assets of the Issuer as described
in Clause (E) above. Furthermore, as the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, the rate of interest on the Notes is not
determined by reference to the performance of the underlying assets of the Issuer as described in Clause
(F) above. In addition, the Issuer expects that the Noteholders will not receive income on a pass-through basis
from the Issuer as described in Clause (F) above, as the Issuer expects that the Noteholders will hold the Notes as
debt and not as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—The
_Issuer is an unaffiliated special purpose financing company which will depend on payments in respect of the_
_Assigned Receivables and under the Framework Assignment Agreement, the New VFZ Facilities Agreement and_
_the Expenses Agreement to provide it with funds to meet its obligations under the Notes”, the “Terms and_
_Conditions of the Notes” and the “Summary of Principal Documents—Trust Deed” included elsewhere in this_
Offering Circular. The Issuer will not be entitled to make any modifications to the terms of the Notes which
would have the effect of reducing or cancelling the amount of principal payable in respect of the Notes or
altering the rate of interest applicable in respect of the Notes (each of which would constitute a Basic Terms
Modification), without the approval of the Noteholders by Extraordinary Resolution (in respect of a Basic Terms
Modification), in accordance with the Trust Deed and the Conditions. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the
_Notes—Amendments, waivers, Noteholder resolutions and instructions” and “Terms and Conditions of the Notes”_
included elsewhere in this Offering Circular.

The Trust Deed and Conditions relating to the Notes do not confer upon the Noteholders any synthetic rights
to have, receive or be allocated any of the rights in Clauses (A) through (F) above.

Before making an investment in the Notes, each potential investor in the Notes should consult with its own
counsel and make its own determination as to whether it is subject to the Volcker Rule, whether the Issuer is a
“covered fund”, whether the Notes constitute “ownership interests”, whether any exclusion or exemption might
be applicable to an investment in the Notes by such investor, whether its investment in the Notes would or could
in the future be restricted or prohibited under the Volcker Rule, and the potential impact of the Volcker Rule on
its investment, any liquidity in connection therewith and on its portfolio generally. See “Transfer Restrictions—
_Investor Representations” in this Offering Circular._

The Volcker Rule and any similar measures introduced in another relevant jurisdiction may impact on the
price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market or restrict prospective investors’ ability to hold the
Notes. Each purchaser is responsible for analysing its own regulatory position under the Volcker Rule and any

43


-----

similar measures, and none of VodafoneZiggo, the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Administrator, the Obligors,
the Security Trustee or the Notes Trustee nor any of their affiliates makes any representation to any prospective
investor or purchaser of the Notes regarding the treatment of the Issuer or the Notes under the Volcker Rule or to
the impact of the Volcker Rule on such investor’s investment in the Notes on the Issue Date or at any time in the
future.

**_Anti–money laundering, corruption, bribery and similar laws may require certain actions or disclosures_**

Many jurisdictions have adopted wide–ranging anti–money laundering, economic and trade sanctions, and
anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, and regulations (collectively, the “AML Requirements”). Any of the
Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Administrator, the Buyer Parent, the Security Trustee or the Notes Trustee
could be requested or required to obtain certain assurances from prospective investors intending to purchase
Notes and to retain such information or to disclose information pertaining to them to governmental, regulatory or
other authorities or to financial intermediaries or engage in due diligence or take other related actions in the
future. It is expected that the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Administrator, the Buyer Parent, the Security
Trustee and the Notes Trustee will comply with AML Requirements to which they are or may become subject
and to interpret such AML Requirements broadly in favour of disclosure. Failure to honour any request by the
Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Administrator, the Buyer Parent, the Security Trustee or the Notes Trustee to
provide requested information or take such other actions as may be necessary or advisable for the Issuer, the
Initial Purchasers, the Administrator, the Buyer Parent, the Security Trustee or the Notes Trustee to comply with
any AML Requirements, related legal process or appropriate requests (whether formal or informal) may result in,
among other things, a forced sale to another investor of such investor’s Notes. In addition, it is expected that each
of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Administrator, the Buyer Parent, the Security Trustee and the Notes
Trustee intends to comply with applicable anti–money laundering and anti–terrorism, economic and trade
sanctions, and anti–corruption or anti–bribery laws and regulations of the United States and other countries, and
will disclose any information required or requested by authorities in connection therewith.

**_Evolution of international fiscal and taxation policy and OECD Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit_**
**_Shifting_**

Fiscal and taxation policy and practice is constantly evolving and recently the pace of change has increased
due to a number of developments. In particular a number of changes of law and practice are occurring as a result
of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting
project (“BEPS”).

In July 2013, the OECD published its Action Plan on BEPS, which proposed fifteen actions intended to
counter international tax base erosion and profit shifting. The focus of one of the action points (“Action 6”) is the
prevention of treaty abuse by developing model treaty provisions to prevent the granting of treaty benefits in
inappropriate circumstances. Action 6 and other action points, such as Action 4, which can deny deductions for
financing costs, may affect, and may be implemented in a manner which affects, the tax position of the Issuer.

On 5 October 2015, the OECD released its final recommendations (the “Final Report”), including in
respect of Action 6. On 24 November 2016, more than 100 jurisdictions (including the Netherlands) concluded
negotiations on a multilateral convention that is intended to implement a number of BEPS related measures
swiftly, including Action 6, by modifying existing bilateral tax treaties. The multilateral convention has been
signed by over 89 jurisdictions to date (including the Netherlands), and it remains open for signing. A number of
further jurisdictions have formally expressed their intention to sign the multilateral convention. On 29 March
2019, the Netherlands deposited its instrument of ratification of the multilateral convention with the OECD. The
Netherlands opted in for most of the BEPS measures, including those recommended as part of Action 6. The
multilateral convention will have general entry into effect for the Netherlands as from 2020. As from 1 January
2020, the multilateral convention should apply in respect of withholding taxes for the covered tax treaties
concluded by the Netherlands with other jurisdictions that completed their ratification process prior to 1 October
2019. With respect to all other taxes, such as corporate income tax, the multilateral convention will have an
impact on tax years starting on or after at least nine months after the Netherlands or the other treaty jurisdiction
has deposited the ratification instrument with the OECD (whichever date is latest).

_Action 6_

Action 6 is intended to prevent the granting of treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances. The
multilateral convention provides for double tax treaties to include a “principal purpose test” (“PPT”), which

44


-----

would deny a treaty benefit where it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all relevant facts and
circumstances, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction
that resulted directly or indirectly in that benefit, unless it is established that granting that benefit in those
circumstances would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions of the treaty. It is
unclear how a PPT, if adopted, would be applied by the tax authorities of those jurisdictions from which
payments are made to the Issuer.

The multilateral convention also permits jurisdictions to choose to apply, in addition to the PPT, a
“simplified limitation on benefits” rule or, alternatively, to choose to have no PPT at all, but instead to include a
“detailed limitation on benefits” rule together with rules to address “conduit financing structures”. The
Netherlands did not elect to apply the simplified limitation on benefits rule or permit it to be applied by other
jurisdictions to its treaties. As a result, the covered double tax treaties the Netherlands has entered into with other
jurisdictions are expected to only apply a principal purpose test. It is not entirely clear, however, how this test
would be interpreted by the relevant tax authorities.

On 24 March 2016, the OECD published a public discussion draft consulting on the treaty entitlement of
non-CIV funds (that is, of funds that are not collective investment vehicles). The OECD published a further
public discussion draft on 6 January 2017 and a compilation of the comments it received on it on 24 March 2017.
This work may be relevant to the treaty entitlement of the Issuer. However, the OECD has not yet finalised its
position in relation to non-CIV funds, and in any event it is not clear how any such position might be
implemented through the multilateral convention otherwise than by the bilateral negotiation of a “detailed
limitation on benefits” rule.

_Action 7_

The focus of Action 7 was to develop changes to the treaty definition of a permanent establishment and the
scope of the exemption for an “agent of independent status” to prevent the artificial avoidance of having a
permanent establishment in a particular jurisdiction. The Final Report on Action 7 sets out the changes that will
be made to the definition of a “permanent establishment” in Article 5 of the OECD Model Convention and the
OECD Model Commentary. Among other recommendations, the Final Report on Action 7 recommended two
specific changes to the OECD Model Convention: (i) the expansion of the circumstances in which a “permanent
establishment” is created to include the negotiation of contracts where certain conditions are satisfied; and
(ii) narrowing the exemption for agents of independent status where contracts are concluded by an “independent
agent” and that agent is connected to the foreign enterprise on behalf of which it is acting.

A change in the application or interpretation of double tax treaties (as a result of the adoption of the
recommendations of the Final Report or otherwise) might result in the Issuer being treated as having a taxable
permanent establishment outside of the Netherlands, which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s
business, tax and financial position.

**_E.U. Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive_**

As part of its anti-tax avoidance package the European Commission published a draft Anti-Tax Avoidance
Directive on 28 January 2016, which was formally adopted by the EC Council on 12 July 2016 in Council
Directive (EU) 2016/1164 (the “Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 1”). The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 1 had to
be implemented by each Member State by 2019, subject to derogations for Member States which have equivalent
measures in their domestic law. The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 1 provides that net borrowing costs
(including, interest expenses and economically equivalent costs) in excess of the higher of (a) €3,000,000
(assuming implementation includes this derogation) or (b) 30% of an entity’s earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization will not be deductible in the year in which they are incurred but could, depending
on how the directive is implemented in a Member State, remain available for carry forward. In the Netherlands,
this rule was implemented more strictly than prescribed in the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 1 by opting for a
€1,000,000 threshold instead of €3,000,000. Net borrowing costs that cannot be deducted in a certain year may in
principle be carried forward.

The restriction on interest deductibility would only be in respect of the amount by which the borrowing
costs exceed “taxable interest revenues and other equivalent taxable revenues”. Accordingly, as the Issuer will
generally fund interest payments it makes under the Notes from interest payments to which it is entitled under the
New VFZ Facilities Agreement, Shortfall Payments it receives under the New VFZ Facilities Agreement and the
amounts repaid on the Assigned Receivables (such that the Issuer may pay limited or no net borrowing costs), the
restriction may have limited relevance to the Issuer.

**_The Issuer is an unaffiliated special purpose financing company which will depend on payments in respect of_**
**_the Assigned Receivables and under the Framework Assignment Agreement, the New VFZ Facilities_**
**_Agreement and the Expenses Agreement to provide it with funds to meet its obligations under the Notes_**

The Issuer has been formed as a special purpose financing company for the primary purpose of facilitating
the offering of the Notes. The Issuer has no material business operations, no direct subsidiaries and no employees
and, upon completion of the offering of the Notes, its only material assets will be the Assigned Receivables, the
New VFZ Facilities Loans and rights (including its right to receive any Shortfall Payments) under the New VFZ
Facilities Agreement and its rights under certain transaction documents (including the Expenses Agreement, the
Issue Date Arrangements Agreement and the Framework Assignment Agreement). Furthermore, the Trust Deed
governing the Notes prohibits the Issuer from engaging in any activities other than certain limited activities
permitted under Condition 4 (“Covenants”). As such, the Issuer is wholly dependent on the payments it will
receive in respect of the Assigned Receivables and under the Framework Assignment Agreement, the New VFZ
Facilities Agreement and the Expenses Agreement as and when required to fund certain costs, expenses and
liabilities of the Issuer and any payments of interest or principal on the Notes and, if applicable, any premiums on
any redemption pursuant to the Trust Deed and the payment of any Additional Amounts required to be paid
under the Notes. A failure by the New VFZ Facilities Borrower and/or any other Obligor to provide such
funding, and by the Platform Provider in certain limited circumstances to make payments due to the Issuer, may
negatively impact the ability of the Issuer to meet its obligations under the Transaction Documents or otherwise
to third parties which may, in turn, whether directly or indirectly, negatively impact the ability of the Issuer to
meet its obligations under the Notes.

**_The right of the Issuer to receive payments from the Obligors in respect of the Assigned Receivables and_**
**_under the Framework Assignment Agreement, the New VFZ Facilities Agreement, the Expenses Agreement_**
**_and the related agreements, as applicable, is effectively subordinated to the rights of existing and future_**
**_secured creditors of such Obligors._**

The Issuer is dependent upon payments it receives from the Obligors in respect of the Assigned Receivables
and under the Framework Assignment Agreement, the New VFZ Facilities Agreement, the Expenses Agreement
and the related agreements, as applicable, to make payments on the Notes, but its claims against the Obligors
pursuant to the Assigned Receivables and such agreements will be effectively subordinated to any future secured
indebtedness of the Obligors, to the extent of the value of the assets and property securing such indebtedness.

Therefore, in the event of any distribution of the Obligors’ assets or payment in any foreclosure, dissolution,
winding-up, liquidation, reorganization or other bankruptcy, secured creditors of the Obligors will be paid first
from the assets securing their claims, and the Issuer, as an unsecured creditor of the Obligors, will participate in
any residual distribution, ratably with all holders of the Obligors’ other unsecured indebtedness that is deemed to
be of the same ranking, only to the extent that the Obligors’ secured indebtedness has been repaid in full from
those assets. We cannot assure you that, following realization of their security by the Obligors’ secured creditors,
there will be sufficient assets in any such distribution, foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or other
bankruptcy proceeding to pay amounts due to the Issuer in respect of the Assigned Receivables or under the
Framework Assignment Agreement, the New VFZ Facilities Agreement, the Expenses Agreement and the related
agreements.

**_Limited recourse obligations_**

The Notes are limited recourse obligations of the Issuer and, in an enforcement scenario, are payable solely
from amounts received in respect of the Notes Collateral securing the Notes. Payments on the Notes both prior to
and following enforcement of the security over the Notes Collateral are subordinated to the prior payment of
certain fees and expenses of, or payable by, the Issuer. See Condition 3 (“Status, Priority and Security”). None of
VodafoneZiggo or its subsidiaries, the Administrator, the Noteholders, the Initial Purchasers, the Obligors, the
Security Trustee, the Notes Trustee or any other Agent or any affiliates of any of the foregoing or the Issuer’s
affiliates or any other person or entity (other than the Issuer) will be obliged to make payments on the Notes.

Consequently, Noteholders must rely solely on distributions on the Notes Collateral securing the Notes for
the payment of principal, discount, interest and premium, if any, thereon. There can be no assurance that the
distributions on the Notes Collateral securing the Notes will be sufficient to make payments on the Notes after
making payments on required amounts to other creditors ranking senior to or pari passu with the Notes pursuant
to the Priorities of Payment. If distributions on the Notes Collateral are insufficient to make payments on the

46


-----

Notes, no other assets (and, in particular, no assets of the Administrator, the Noteholders, the Initial Purchasers,
the Obligors, the Security Trustee, the Notes Trustee, any other Agent or any affiliates of any of the foregoing)
will be available for payment of the deficiency and following realization of the Notes Collateral and the
application of the proceeds thereof in accordance with the Priorities of Payment, the obligations of the Issuer to
pay such deficiency shall be extinguished. Such shortfall will be borne (as amongst the Noteholders) in
accordance with the Priorities of Payment.

Furthermore, none of VodafoneZiggo nor any of its subsidiaries will guarantee or provide any credit support
to the Issuer with respect to its obligations under the Notes. Other than under the limited circumstances described
herein, Noteholders will not have a direct claim on the cash flow or assets of VodafoneZiggo or any of its
subsidiaries, and neither VodafoneZiggo nor any of its subsidiaries has any obligation, contingent or otherwise,
to pay amounts due under the Notes, or to make funds available to the Issuer for those payments, other than the
obligations of (i) the Obligors to make payments to the Issuer in respect of the Assigned Receivables, (ii) the
Obligors to make payments to the Issuer in respect of the New VFZ Facilities Agreement or (iii) VZ Financing I
B.V. to make payments to the Issuer under the Expenses Agreement, and in each case of (i) to (iii) above, the
agreements related thereto to which it is party.

Additionally, except for the specific interests of the Issuer in respect of the Assigned Receivables (including
as under the Framework Assignment Agreement), as under the New VFZ Facilities Agreement, the Expenses
Agreement and the Issue Date Arrangements Agreement, or as otherwise expressly provided in the terms of the
Trust Deed, no proprietary or other direct interest in the Issuer’s rights under or in respect of the New VFZ
Facilities Agreement, the Expenses Agreement or the Issue Date Arrangements Agreement exists for the benefit
of the Noteholders. Further, subject to the terms of the Trust Deed, no Noteholder can enforce any provision of
the New VFZ Facilities Agreement (or any other item of Notes Collateral) or have direct recourse to the New
VFZ Facilities Borrower (or any other subsidiary of VodafoneZiggo) except through an action by the Security
Trustee pursuant to the rights granted to the Security Trustee under the Trust Deed. Under the Trust Deed, the
Security Trustee shall not be required to take proceedings to enforce payment under the New VFZ Facilities
Agreement (or any other item of Notes Collateral) unless it has been indemnified and/or secured to its
satisfaction. In addition, neither the Issuer, the Notes Trustee nor the Security Trustee is required to monitor the
New VFZ Facilities Borrower’s (or any other Obligor’s) financial performance.

In addition, at any time while the Notes are outstanding, none of the Noteholders, the Security Trustee nor
any other Secured Party (nor any other person acting on behalf of any of them) shall be entitled at any time to
institute against the Issuer, or join in any institution against the Issuer of, any bankruptcy, reorganization,
arrangement, insolvency, examinership, winding up or liquidation proceedings or other proceedings under any
applicable bankruptcy or similar law in connection with any obligations of the Issuer relating to the Notes, the
Trust Deed or otherwise owed to the Noteholders, save for lodging a claim in the liquidation of the Issuer which
is initiated by another party (which is not an affiliate of such party) or taking proceedings to obtain a declaration
as to the obligations of the Issuer.

**_The Notes may be redeemed prior to the Maturity Date_**

The Notes may be redeemed prior to the Maturity Date, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions (as
described in the relevant provisions of Condition 6 (“Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation; Approved
_Exchange Offer”) and “Summary of the Notes”). In the event of an early redemption or in connection with an_
Approved Exchange Offer, the Noteholders will be repaid prior to the Maturity Date.

The Issuer will redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, upon voluntary prepayment of all the New VFZ
Facilities Loans by the New VFZ Facilities Borrower, as described in “Summary of the Notes—Early
_Redemption: Tax Event”, “Summary of the Notes—Early Make-Whole Redemption Event”, “Summary of the_
_Notes—Early Redemption Event on or after_ _2020”, and Condition 6 (“Redemption, Purchase and_
_Cancellation; Approved Exchange Offer”), and at the redemption prices described in the foregoing sections and_
Conditions. The Issuer will also redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at their principal amount together
with interest and other amounts (if any) accrued to the redemption date, if at any time it becomes unlawful in any
applicable jurisdiction for the Issuer to be a lender or to perform any of its obligations under the New VFZ
Facilities Agreement, as described in “Summary of the Notes—Early Redemption: Illegality” and the relevant
provisions of Condition 6 (“Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation; Approved Exchange Offer”).

Additionally, following a Change of Control (as defined under the New VFZ Facilities Agreement), the
New VFZ Facilities Borrower will be required to offer to prepay the New VFZ Facilities Loans (as defined

47


-----

herein). Following receipt of such prepayment offer, the Issuer will launch a consent solicitation to set (i) the
Maturity Date of the Notes as the New Maturity Date (as defined herein) and (ii) the redemption price of the
Notes on the New Maturity Date at 101% of the principal amount of the Notes (“Accelerated Redemption
**Price”), plus accrued and unpaid interest to the New Maturity Date, in accordance with the relevant provisions of**
Condition 6 (“Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation; Approved Exchange Offer”). If holders of more than
50% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes (voting as one class) consent to the foregoing requests
(“Accelerated Maturity Event”), the Issuer will inform the New VFZ Facilities Borrower that it accepts the
prepayment offer, and the New VFZ Facilities Borrower will prepay the New VFZ Facilities Loans at par, plus
accrued and unpaid interest thereon, together with a payment equal to 1% of the principal amount of the Excess
Cash Loans and Interest Facility Loans so prepaid. Following such prepayment, the Issuer will redeem all of the
Notes on the New Maturity Date at the Accelerated Redemption Price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the
New Maturity Date. The Change of Control offer under the New VFZ Facilities Agreement differs from the
change of control offer required under the indentures of each tranche of the Existing Senior Secured Notes and
the Existing Senior Notes, whereby we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding notes at a price
equal to 101% of their principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any,
to the date of repurchase.

Further, the Notes may be redeemed prior to the Maturity Date in connection with an Approved Exchange
Offer (as defined herein). See Conditions 6(k) and 6(l) (“Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation; Approved
_Exchange Offer—Approved Exchange Offer”)._

**_The New VFZ Facilities Borrower may not have the ability to raise funds necessary to finance required_**
**_prepayments of the New VFZ Facilities in the event of a change of control thereunder_**

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the New VFZ Facilities Agreement), the New
VFZ Facilities Borrower is required to offer to prepay the New VFZ Facilities Loans. If, following an
Accelerated Maturity Event under the Notes, the Issuer accepts the prepayment offer, the New VFZ Facilities
Borrower will be required to prepay the New VFZ Facilities (including all the New VFZ Facilities Loans) and to
make a payment equal to 1% of the Excess Cash Loans and Interest Facility Loans so prepaid. The ability of the
New VFZ Facilities Borrower to prepay the New VFZ Facilities Loans upon such accepted prepayment offer
would be limited by its access to funds at the time of the prepayment and the terms of its other debt agreements,
which agreements could restrict or prohibit such a prepayment. Upon a Change of Control, the New VFZ
Facilities Borrower may be required to immediately repay the outstanding principal, any accrued interest on and
any other amounts owed by it under one or more of its other bank facilities. The source of funds for these
repayments would be its available cash or cash generated from other sources. However, there can be no assurance
that the New VFZ Facilities Borrower will have sufficient funds available upon a Change of Control to make
these repayments. If the New VFZ Facilities Borrower is not able to make the required prepayment of the New
VFZ Facilities (including the New VFZ Facilities Loans), the Issuer will not be able to redeem the Notes at the
New Maturity Date.

**_Notes Collateral_**

The Notes will be secured by: (i) a first fixed charge over the Issuer’s rights, title, benefit and interest in, to
and under the Assigned Receivables; (ii) an assignment by way of security over the Issuer’s rights under all
contracts, agreements, deeds and documents to which it is or may become a party or in respect of which it has or
may have any right, title, benefit or interest (including, without limitation, the New VFZ Facilities Agreement,
the Expenses Agreement, the Framework Assignment Agreement and the Issue Date Arrangements Agreement);
(iii) a first fixed charge over the Issuer’s rights to all amounts at any time standing to the credit of the Issuer
Transaction Accounts; and (iv) a first floating charge over all of the present and future property, assets and
undertakings of the Issuer not subject to the fixed charges or assignments by way of security described above.

Although the security constituted by the Notes Security Documents over the Notes Collateral held from time
to time, including the security over the Issuer Transaction Accounts, is expressed to take effect as a fixed charge,
it may (as a result of, among other things, the substitutions of Assigned Receivables contemplated by the
Framework Assignment Agreement and the payments to be made from the Issuer Transaction Accounts in
accordance with the Conditions and the Trust Deed) take effect as a floating charge which, in particular, would
rank after a subsequently created fixed charge. However, the Issuer has covenanted in the Trust Deed and the
Conditions not to create any such subsequent security interests (other than those permitted under the Trust Deed)
without the consent of the Notes Trustee.

**_Your rights in the Notes Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in_**
**_Notes Collateral_**

Applicable law requires that a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected and its
priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. Neither the Security Trustee nor the
Trustee has any obligation to take steps to perfect any security interest in the Notes Collateral. The liens in the
Notes Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Security Trustee on
behalf of the Secured Parties, including the Noteholders, if the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens on
or prior to the date of the Notes Security Documents are not taken. For example, applicable law may require that
certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as real property, equipment
subject to a certificate and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are
acquired and identified. The Issuer has limited obligations to perfect the Security Trustee’s security interest in the
specified Notes Collateral. Neither the Notes Trustee nor the Security Trustee has any obligation to monitor the
acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute Notes Collateral or the perfection of any security
interest. None of the Security Trustee or the other Secured Parties, including the Notes Trustee, will monitor, and
there can be no assurance that the Issuer will inform the Security Trustee or Notes Trustee of the future
acquisition of property and rights that constitute Notes Collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to
properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired Notes Collateral. Such failure may result in the loss of
the security interest in the Notes Collateral or the priority of the security interest in favour of the Security Trustee
on behalf of the Secured Parties against third parties.

**_Your ability to recover under the Notes Collateral may be limited_**

The Noteholders will benefit from security interests in the Notes Collateral.

The Notes Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances,
liens and other imperfections as may be accepted by any other creditors that also have the benefit of first liens on
the Notes Collateral securing the Notes from time to time, whether on or after the date the Notes are issued.
Neither the Initial Purchasers nor the Security Trustee have analysed the effect of, or participated in any
negotiations relating to, such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections. The existence of
any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the
Notes Collateral securing the Notes as well as the ability of the Security Trustee to realize or foreclose on such
Notes Collateral.

The security interest of the Security Trustee will be subject to practical problems generally associated with
the realization of security interests in Notes Collateral. For example, the Security Trustee may need to obtain the
consent of a third party to obtain or enforce a security interest in a contract. The Issuer cannot assure you that the
Security Trustee will be able to obtain any such consent. It also cannot assure you that the consents of any third
parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Trustee
may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets and the value of the Notes Collateral may significantly
decrease.

**_The Notes Collateral may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain limitations or defences that may_**
**_adversely affect their validity and enforceability_**

The Notes or the Notes Collateral may be subject to claims that they should be limited or subordinated
under Dutch or other applicable law.

The grant of the Notes Collateral in favour of the Security Trustee may also be voidable by the grantor or by
an insolvency trustee, liquidator, examiner, receiver or administrator or by other creditors, or may be otherwise
set aside by a court, if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the grantor is
deemed to be insolvent at the time of the grant, or if the grant permits the Secured Parties to receive a greater
recovery than if the grant had not been given and insolvency proceedings in respect of the grantor are
commenced within a legally specified “clawback” period following the grant. Accordingly, enforcement of any
Notes Collateral would be subject to certain defences available to the grantor thereof generally or, in some cases,
to limitations contained in the Trust Deed or Notes Security Documents designed to ensure compliance with
capital maintenance rules and other statutory requirements applicable to the relevant grantor. As a result, a
grantor’s liability under its Notes Collateral could be materially reduced or eliminated.

In addition, the granting of new security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes may trigger
hardening periods for such security interests. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests

49


-----

will run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or perfected. At each time, if the security
interest recreated or granted were to be enforced and a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings
were to be filed before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be
declared void or ineffective or it may not be possible to enforce it.

It is possible that the grantor of the Notes Collateral or a creditor thereof, or the insolvency administrator in
the case of the insolvency of a grantor of Notes Collateral, may contest the validity and enforceability of the
Notes Collateral on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Notes
Collateral should be limited or voided. To the extent that agreed limitations on the obligations secured by the
Notes Collateral apply, the Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to that extent to all liabilities of
the grantor of the Notes Collateral, including trade receivables of such grantor of Notes Collateral. Future Notes
Collateral to be granted may be subject to similar limitations.

**_The various insolvency and administrative laws of the Netherlands to which the Obligors and the Issuer are_**
**_subject may not be favourable to creditors, including the Issuer as lender under the New VFZ Facilities Loans_**
**_and assignee under the Assigned Receivables and the Noteholders, as the case may be, and may limit the_**
**_Issuer’s ability to enforce its rights under the New VFZ Facilities Loans and the Assigned Receivables and_**
**_your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, as the case may be._**

Under Regulation (EU) No. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on
insolvency proceedings (recast) (the “Recast E.U. Insolvency Regulation”), a company’s location of its centre
of main interest (“COMI”) is presumed to be the place of its registered office in the absence of proof to the
contrary and provided that the company did not move its registered office within the three months prior to a
request to open insolvency proceedings. The Issuer and the Obligors are incorporated under the laws of the
Netherlands and have their statutory seat (statutaire zetel) in the Netherlands. Consequently, in the event of a
bankruptcy or insolvency event with respect to the Issuer and the Obligors, primary proceedings would likely be
initiated in the Netherlands. Dutch insolvency laws may make it difficult or impossible to effect a restructuring.
If the Issuer’s or the Obligors’ COMI was found to be in another E.U. jurisdiction and not in the Netherlands,
main insolvency proceedings would be opened in that jurisdiction instead.

There are two primary insolvency regimes under Dutch law. The first, suspension of payments (surseance
_van betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s debts and enable a company to continue as_
a going concern. The second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is designed to liquidate and distribute the assets of a
debtor to its creditors.

Upon commencement of suspension of payments proceedings, the court will grant a provisional suspension.
A definitive suspension will generally be granted in a creditors’ meeting called for that purpose, unless a
qualified minority (more than one-quarter in amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’
meeting or one-third in number of creditors represented at such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured
nonpreferential creditors withholds its consent or if there is no prospect that the company will in the future be
able to pay its debts as they fall due (in which case the company will generally be declared bankrupt). During a
suspension of payments, unsecured and non-preferential creditors will be precluded from attempting to recover
their claims from the assets of the company. A suspension of payments is subject to exceptions, the most
important of which excludes secured creditors and preferential creditors (such as tax and social security
authorities and employees) from the application of the suspension. This implies that during suspension of
payments proceedings secured creditors may proceed against the assets that secure their claims to satisfy their
claims, and preferential creditors are also not barred from seeking to recover their claims. However, the court
may order a “cooling down period” (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of four months during which
enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred. In a suspension of payments, a composition
(akkoord) may be offered by the company to its creditors. Such a composition will be binding on all unsecured
and non-preferential creditors, irrespective whether they voted in favor or against it or whether they were
represented at the creditor’s meeting called for the purpose of voting on the composition plan, if (i) it is approved
by more than 50% in number of the general unsecured and non-preferential creditors present or represented at the
creditor’s meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the general unsecured and nonpreferential claims
admitted for voting purposes and (ii) it is subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court.

Under Dutch bankruptcy proceedings, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds
distributed to a company’s creditors on a pari passu basis. Certain creditors (such as secured creditors and
preferential creditors) have special rights that may adversely affect the interests of holders of the Notes and the
Issuer, as lender under the respective New VFZ Facilities Loans. For example, a Dutch bankruptcy does not

50


-----

prohibit secured creditors from taking recourse against the encumbered assets of the bankrupt debtor to satisfy
their claims. However, the court may order a “cooling down period” (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period
of four months during which enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred. Consequently,
Dutch insolvency laws could reduce the potential recovery of a holder of the Notes or the Issuer under the New
VFZ Facilities Loans in Dutch bankruptcy proceedings. To obtain payment on unsecured non-preferential claims,
such claims need to be submitted to the trustee in bankruptcy (curator) for verification. “Verification” under
Dutch law means that the trustee verifies the value of the claim and whether and to what extent it may be
admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings. The claim of a creditor may be limited depending on the date the claim
becomes due and payable in accordance with its terms. Generally, claims of holders of the Notes which were not
due and payable by their terms on the date of a bankruptcy of the Issuer or, in the case or the New VFZ Facilities
Loans, the date of a bankruptcy of the relevant Obligor, are only admissible for verification for their net present
value if they mature more than one year after opening of the bankruptcy. Each of these claims will have to be
submitted to the trustee of the Issuer or the trustee of the relevant Obligor for verification. Creditors that wish to
dispute the valuation of their claims by the trustee will need to commence a court proceeding. These verification
procedures could result in holders of the Notes and the Issuer, as lender under the New VFZ Facilities Loans,
receiving a right to recover less than the principal amount of their Notes or amounts owed under such New VFZ
Facilities Loans, as the case may be. In addition, in a Dutch bankruptcy in practice usually no or little funds
remain available for the payment of unsecured and nonpreferential creditors.

In a bankruptcy, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to the unsecured and non-preferential creditors.
Such a composition will be binding upon all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if (i) it is approved by a
simple majority of a meeting of the recognized and admitted creditors representing at least 50% of the amount of
the recognized and of the admitted claims and (ii) it is subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court.

As a consequence of the foregoing, Dutch insolvency laws could reduce the recovery of holders of the Notes
and the Issuer, as lender under the New VFZ Facilities Loans, in a Dutch insolvency proceeding.

**_The Notes, the New VFZ Facilities Loans and the Payment Obligations may be voidable under Dutch_**
**_fraudulent conveyance laws._**

Dutch law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside of
bankruptcy, the so-called actio pauliana provisions. The actio pauliana offers creditors protection against a
decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an
agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide
or provides security for any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from
existing security and any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside bankruptcy of the
relevant person and may be nullified by the bankruptcy trustee in a bankruptcy of the relevant person or by any
of the creditors of the relevant person outside bankruptcy, if: (i) the person performed such acts without an
obligation to do so (onverplicht); (ii) the creditor concerned or, in the case of the person’s bankruptcy, any
creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the act was
performed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more
of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery, unless the act was entered into
for no consideration (om niet) in which case such knowledge of the counterparty is not necessary for a successful
challenge on grounds of fraudulent conveyance.

If a Dutch court found that the issuance of the Notes or the Payment Obligations or the lending of the New
VFZ Facilities Loans involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under Dutch law,
then the issuance of the Notes or the issuance of the Payment Obligations or the lending of the New VFZ
Facilities Loans could be nullified. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes or the Issuer,
as applicable, may not enjoy the benefit of the Notes, the New VFZ Facilities Loans or the Payment Obligations,
as applicable. Additionally, the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes or the Issuer, as applicable,
receive with respect to the Notes, the New VFZ Facilities Loans or the Payment Obligations could also be subject
to recovery from other creditors of the Issuer, VodafoneZiggo (in its capacity as Buyer Parent) or the Obligor
Subsidiaries, the New VFZ Facilities Borrower or the New VFZ Facilities Guarantors, as applicable, and,
possibly, from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the Notes and the Issuer
might be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer, VodafoneZiggo (in its
capacity as Buyer Parent), the Obligor Subsidiaries, the New VFZ Facilities Borrower or the New VFZ Facilities
Guarantors, as applicable, as a result of the fraudulent conveyance.

**_Corporate benefit and financial assistance laws and other limitations on the obligations under the Notes, the_**
**_New VFZ Facilities Loans and the Payment Obligations may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of_**
**_the Notes, the New VFZ Facilities Loans and the Payment Obligations._**

The Notes, the New VFZ Facilities Loans, the Payment Obligations and the obligations thereunder may be
voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable law. Enforcement of the obligations under the Notes against
the Issuer, enforcement of the Payment Obligations against the Obligors and enforcement of the New VFZ
Facilities Loans against the New VFZ Facilities Borrower and the New VFZ Facilities Guarantors will, in each
case, be subject to certain defenses available to the Issuer, the Obligors, the New VFZ Facilities Borrower and
the New VFZ Facilities Guarantors, as the case may be. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to
fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit and regulations or defenses affecting the rights of
creditors generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, the Issuer, the Obligors, the New
VFZ Facilities Borrower or the New VFZ Facilities Guarantors may have no liability or decreased liability under
the Notes, the New VFZ Facilities Loans and the Payment Obligations, as the case may be, or the Notes, the New
VFZ Facilities Loans and the Payment Obligations, as the case may be, may be unenforceable.

**_You may not be able to enforce the security interests in the Notes Collateral the due to restrictions on_**
**_enforcement contained in Dutch corporate law._**

Under Dutch law, the enforcement of the security interests in the Notes Collateral and guarantees may, in
whole or in part, also be limited to the extent that the obligations of the Issuer, the Obligors, the New VFZ
Facilities Borrower, the New VFZ Facilities Guarantors or their respective parents, as applicable, under the
security are not within the scope of its objects and the counterparty under the security was aware or ought to have
been aware (without inquiry) of this fact. The articles of association of each of the Issuer, the Obligors, the New
VFZ Facilities Borrower, the New VFZ Facilities Guarantors or their respective parents, as applicable, permit the
provision of security for, among others, group companies. However, the determination of whether a legal act is
within the objects of a company may not be based solely on the description of the articles of association, but
must take into account all relevant circumstances, including, in particular, the question whether the interests of
such company are served by the relevant legal act. If the granting of the applicable security in the light of the
benefits, if any, derived by the Issuer, the Obligors, the New VFZ Facilities Borrower, the New VFZ Facilities
Guarantors or their respective parents, as applicable, from creating such interests, would have an adverse effect
on the interests of the Issuer, the Obligors, the New VFZ Facilities Borrower, the New VFZ Facilities Guarantors
or their respective parents, as applicable, the relevant security may be found to be voidable or unenforceable
upon the request of the Issuer, the Obligors, the New VFZ Facilities Borrower, the New VFZ Facilities
Guarantors or their respective parents, as applicable, or any administrator in bankruptcy. As a result,
notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of the articles of association of the Issuer, the Obligors, the New VFZ
Facilities Borrower, the New VFZ Facilities Guarantors or their respective parents, as applicable, the security is
within the objects of and in the interest of the Issuer, the Obligors, the New VFZ Facilities Borrower, the New
VFZ Facilities Guarantors or their respective parents, as applicable, no assurance can be given that a court would
conclude that the granting of the security is within the objects of the Issuer, the Guarantors or their respective
parents, as applicable. To the extent the Issuer, the Obligors, the New VFZ Facilities Borrower, the New VFZ
Facilities Guarantors or their respective parents, as applicable, or any administrator successfully invokes the
voidability or non-enforceability of the security, such security would be limited to the extent any portion of it is
not nullified and remains enforceable.

**_Amendments, waivers, resolutions and instructions_**

The Conditions and the Trust Deed contain detailed provisions governing modification of the Conditions
and the Transaction Documents and the convening of meetings and passing of resolutions by the Noteholders,
voting as a single class. Certain key risks relating to these provisions are summarised below.

Decisions may be taken by Noteholders, voting as a single class, by way of Extraordinary Resolutions,
which can be effected either at a duly convened meeting of the Noteholders (a “Meeting”)) or by a resolution in
writing signed by or on behalf of all of the Noteholders. Meetings of the Noteholders may be convened by the
Issuer, the Notes Trustee or by one or more Noteholders holding not less than 10 per cent. of the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, subject to certain conditions (including minimum notice
periods). In addition, at any time after a Note Acceleration Notice (as defined in Condition 1 (“Definitions and
_Principles of Construction—General Interpretation”)) has been given to the Issuer, the Noteholders by an_
Extraordinary Resolution may instruct the Notes Trustee in writing to instruct the Security Trustee to give an
Enforcement Notice (as defined in Condition 1 (“Definitions and Principles of Construction—General
_Interpretation”)) to the Issuer, as set out in Condition 11 (“Enforcement”)._

52


-----

Any modification of certain terms, including, among other things (other than in connection with an
Accelerated Maturity Event), the date of maturity of the Notes or a modification which would have the effect of
postponing any date for payment of interest on the Notes, the reduction or cancellation of the amount of principal
payable in respect of the Notes, the alteration of the rate of interest applicable in respect of the Notes, the
alteration of the quorum or majority required to pass an Extraordinary Resolution, the alteration of currency of
payment of the Notes or alteration of the manner of redemption of the Notes, any material modification to the
Notes Collateral, any material modification to the certain items in the Priorities of Payment (as more fully
described in Condition 1 (“Definitions and Principles of Construction—General Interpretation”), a “Basic
**Terms Modification”) must be approved by an Extraordinary Resolution (in respect of a Basic Terms**
Modification) of the Noteholders.

Other than a Basic Terms Modification, a modification in connection with an Accelerated Maturity Event,
or a modification which expressly does not require holders’ of the Notes approval, any other modification must
be approved by an Extraordinary Resolution (in respect of matters other than a Basic Terms Modification) of the
Noteholders.

The quorum at any Meeting for passing an Extraordinary Resolution in respect of any matter other than a
Basic Terms Modification will be two or more persons bearing a voting certificate, form of proxy or other
eligible instrument (as further described in Condition 13(d) (“Meeting of Noteholders—Quorum”), a “Voter”), in
each case representing in aggregate more than 50 per cent. of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding. The quorum at any Meeting for passing an Extraordinary Resolution in respect of a Basic Terms
Modification will be two or more Voters representing in aggregate at least 75 per cent. of the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding. In addition, if a quorum is not satisfied at any meeting, lower quorum
thresholds will apply at any meeting previously adjourned for want of quorum, as set out in Condition 13(d)
(“Meeting of Noteholders—Quorum”).

Any such Extraordinary Resolution may be adverse to any group of Noteholders or individual Noteholders.
It should also be noted that amendments may still be effected and waivers may still be granted in respect of such
provisions in circumstances where not all Noteholders agree with the terms thereof and any amendments or
waivers once passed in accordance with the provisions of the Conditions and the Trust Deed will be binding on
all such dissenting Noteholders.

The consent of holders of at least 50% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding will be
required to approve an Accelerated Maturity Event. However, the consent of the Noteholders in respect of an
Accelerated Maturity Event will be validly given if made in accordance with the terms of the Maturity Consent
Solicitation (as defined in Condition 6(g) (“Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation; Approved Exchange
_Offer—Accelerated Maturity Event”)), and need not comply with Schedule D (“Provisions for Meetings of the_
_Noteholders”) of the Trust Deed or any other provisions of the Trust Deed or the Conditions relating to an_
Extraordinary Resolution.

Additionally, certain amendments, modifications and waivers may be made without the consent of
Noteholders, including amendments, among other things, which are (in the Issuer’s determination) not materially
prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders, to (in the Issuer’s determination) correct a manifest error, to give
effect to Permitted Encumbrances (as defined in Condition 1 (“Definitions and Principles of Construction—
_General Interpretation”)), and to give effect, or as otherwise reasonably required to allow for, the Transactions_
(including to give effect to an SCF Platform Addition or SCF Platform Replacement). Such amendments or
modifications could be adverse to certain Noteholders.

Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent (including receipt of an officer’s certificate and
opinion of counsel furnished by the Issuer pursuant to the Trust Deed), the Notes Trustee or the Security Trustee,
as applicable, shall be obliged to concur (without exercising its own discretion in respect of any such
amendments or modification) with the Issuer in making any such amendments or modifications as described
above; provided that the Notes Trustee and/or the Security Trustee, as applicable, shall not be obliged to agree to
any modification which adversely affects its rights, duties, liabilities or immunities, or which, among other
things, would have the effect of breaching any duty at law or any of its fiduciary duties or would expose it to any
liability against which it has not been indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction. While the Conditions and the
Trust Deed contain detailed provisions governing modification of the Conditions, the Trust Deed, and the other
Transaction Documents (including as described above), the consent of the Notes Trustee or Security Trustee, as
applicable, may not be required for certain modifications of the other Transaction Documents (including
modifications of other Transaction Documents to which the Notes Trustee or Security Trustee, as applicable, is

53


-----

not party or where the amendment provisions thereunder do not require the written consent of the Notes Trustee
or Security Trustee, as applicable).

**_Reports provided by the Administrator will not be audited_**

The reports made available to Noteholders will be prepared by the Administrator, on behalf of the Issuer, in
consultation with and based on certain information provided to it by the Buyer Parent. Information in the reports
will not be audited nor will reports include a review or opinion by a public accounting firm, other than as
described under “Summary of Principal Documents—New VFZ Facilities Agreement—Summary of New VFZ
_Facilities Agreement—Reporting Undertakings”._

**_You may be unable to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities laws violations_**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands and does not have any assets in the United
States. It is anticipated that some or all of the directors and officers of the Issuer will be non-residents of the
United States and that all or a majority of their assets will be located outside the United States. As a result, it may
not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer or its respective
directors and officers, or to enforce any judgments obtained in U.S. courts predicated upon civil liability
provisions of the U.S. securities laws. In addition, the Issuer cannot assure you that civil liabilities predicated
upon the federal securities laws of the United States will be enforceable in the Netherlands. See “Listing and
_General Information—Enforceability of Judgments”._

**_Failure of a court to enforce non–petition obligations will adversely affect Noteholders_**

Each Noteholder will agree, and each beneficial owner of Notes will be deemed to agree, pursuant to the
Trust Deed, that it will be subject to non–petition covenants. If such provision failed to be enforceable under
applicable bankruptcy laws, then the filing or presentation of such a petition could result in one or more
payments on the Notes made during the period prior to such filing being deemed to be preferential transfers
subject to avoidance by the bankruptcy trustee or similar official exercising authority with respect to the Issuer’s
bankruptcy estate. It could also result in the bankruptcy court, trustee or receiver liquidating the assets of the
Issuer without regard to any votes or directions required for such liquidation pursuant to the Trust Deed and
could result in any payments under the Notes made during the period prior to such presentation being deemed to
be a fraudulent or improper disposition of the Issuer’s assets.

**_You may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes_**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If you measure your investment returns by reference to
a currency other than euro, an investment in the Notes entails foreign exchange related risks due to, among other
factors, possible significant changes in the value of euro relative to the currency by reference to which you
measure your investment returns because of economic, political and other factors over which we have no control
(including the recent vote by the U.K. to exit the E.U., as described elsewhere in this Offering Circular).
Depreciation of euro against the currency by reference to which you measure your investment returns could
cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to
you when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which you measure your
investment returns. There may be tax consequences for you as a result of any foreign currency gains or losses
from any investment in the Notes.

**_Limited liquidity and restrictions on transfer (including pursuant to U.S. securities laws)_**

There is currently no pre-existing market for the Notes. The Initial Purchasers may make a market for the
Notes, but are not obliged to do so, and any such market-making may be discontinued at any time without notice.
There can be no assurance that any secondary market for any of the Notes will develop or, if a secondary market
does develop, that it will provide the Noteholders with liquidity of investment or that it will continue for the life
of such Notes. Consequently, a purchaser must be prepared to hold such Notes for an indefinite period of time or
until the Maturity Date. Where a market does exist, to the extent that an investor wants to sell Notes, the price
may, or may not, be at a discount from the outstanding principal amount thereof. In addition, no sale, assignment,
participation, pledge or transfer of the Notes may be effected if, among other things, it would require any of the
Issuer or any of their officers or directors to register under, or otherwise be subject to the provisions of, the
Investment Company Act or any other similar legislation or regulatory action. Furthermore, the Notes will not be
registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any U.S. state securities laws, and the Issuer has no plans, and is under

54


-----

no obligation, to register the Notes under the U.S. Securities Act. Therefore, the Notes may be transferred or
resold only in transactions registered under, exempt from or not subject to the registration requirements of the
U.S. Securities Act and all applicable state securities laws. The Notes are subject to certain transfer restrictions
and can be transferred only to certain transferees. See “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions” sections
of this Offering Circular. It is your obligation to ensure that your offers and sales of Notes comply with
applicable law. Such restrictions on the transfer of the Notes may further limit their liquidity.

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the_**
**_relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies_**

Unless and until Notes in definitive registered form, or definitive registered notes, are issued in exchange for
book-entry interests, owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or Noteholders. The common
depository for Euroclear or Clearstream (or its nominee) will be the sole holder of the Global Notes. After
payment to the common depository or the nominee (as the case may be), the Issuer will have no responsibility or
liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests.
Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, and if you are not a participant in Euroclear or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant
through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights of a Noteholder, under the Trust Deed. See “Book_Entry Clearance Procedures” and “Form of the Notes”._

Unlike the Noteholders themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon
the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from Noteholders. Instead, if you own
a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do
so from Euroclear or Clearstream. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of
such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any request actions on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Trust Deed, unless and until definitive
registered notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be
restricted to acting through Euroclear or Clearstream. The Issuer cannot assure you that the procedures to be
implemented through Euroclear or Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the
Notes. See “Book-Entry Clearance Procedures” and “Form of the Notes”.

**_Withholding tax on the Notes_**

Although no withholding tax is currently imposed on payments of interest on the Notes, there can be no
assurance that the law will not change. In the event that any withholding tax or deduction for tax is imposed on
payments of interest on the Notes by certain relevant jurisdictions, subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer will
pay Additional Amounts so that the net amount a Noteholder receives is no less than that which such Noteholder
would have received in the absence of such withholding or deduction. In the event that the Issuer is required to
pay such Additional Amounts but the amount the Issuer receives from VZ Financing I B.V is less than the total
amount of the Additional Amounts required to be paid by the Issuer to all Noteholders on the relevant interest
payment date, the Issuer will only be required to account to each Noteholder for an Additional Amount
equivalent to a pro rata proportion of such amount (if any) as is actually received by, or for the account of, the
Issuer pursuant to the Expenses Agreement. See Condition 9 (“Taxation”).

Subject to certain conditions (including, among other things, that any and all Assigned Receivables are
repaid by the Obligors assigned (or agreed to be assigned) by the Issuer to another person, prior to the date of
redemption, and that all amounts lent to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower under the New VFZ Facilities
Agreement are repaid to the Issuer prior to the date of redemption), as further described in Condition 6(b)
(“Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation; Approved Exchange Offer—Early Redemption: Tax Event”), the
Issuer will, upon giving notice to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower that a Tax Event (as defined in Condition 1
(“Definitions and Principles of Construction—General Interpretation”)) which cannot be cured has occurred or
will occur, and in the event that all amounts lent to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower under the New VFZ
Facilities Agreement are then voluntarily prepaid by the New VFZ Facilities Borrower pursuant to Clause 7.2(a)
(“Voluntary Prepayment”) of the New VFZ Facilities Agreement, redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part. If
the Issuer exercises such redemption right, it must pay the Noteholders a price equal to the principal amount of
the Notes plus interest and other amounts (including any Additional Amounts), if any, to the date of redemption.
See Condition 6(b) (“Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation; Approved Exchange Offer—Early Redemption:
_Tax Event”)._

**_Tax Plan 2020 of the Dutch government_**

On 17 September 2019, the Dutch Ministry of Finance published its Tax Plan 2020 (Pakket Belastingplan
_2020). The Tax Plan 2020 includes several measures, one of which may in particular become relevant within the_
context of the payments in respect of the Notes, being the introduction of a conditional withholding tax on
interest and royalties.

The Tax Plan 2020 proposes to introduce a conditional withholding tax on interest and royalties that will
apply as of 1 January 2021. The conditional withholding tax is an anti-abuse measure and will apply to interest
and royalty payments by a Dutch entity (broadly defined) to a related entity or permanent establishment of such
entity (i) in a specifically listed low-tax jurisdiction that has no profits tax or a tax rate that is lower than 9%, or
which is included in the EU Blacklist for non-cooperative jurisdictions or (ii) in certain abusive situations (for
example, artificial arrangements whereby interest and royalty payments are diverted through a high-tax
jurisdiction to ultimately end up in a low-tax or EU blacklisted jurisdiction). The conditional withholding tax will
be levied at a rate of 21.7%, equal to the headline Dutch corporate income tax rate in 2021.

Entities (i.e. a payer and payee) are related to one another if (i) the payer has a ‘qualifying interest’ in the
payee or vice versa or (ii) a third entity has a qualifying interest in both the payer and the payee. Entities can also
be related if they are considered a cooperating group that jointly, directly or indirectly, have a qualifying interest
in an entity. A qualifying interest is an interest through which directly or indirectly sufficient influence can be
exercised, such that the activities of the relevant entity can be determined. In any event, an interest is qualifying
if it represents more than 50% of the statutory voting rights in an entity.

Given the scope of application of the law proposal as well as its spirit, payments on listed and other
securities (e.g., Notes) issued in the market are expected generally not to be caught by this conditional
withholding tax, if the law proposal is implemented in its proposed form.

If the conditional withholding tax becomes due with respect to interest payments on the Notes, the Issuer
will become obliged to pay Additional Amounts (as defined under Condition 9 (“Taxation”)) to the recipient of
such interest payments or Issuer may redeem the relevant Notes as described in “Summary of the Notes—
_Additional amounts; tax redemption.”_

**_An active trading market may not develop for the Notes and the price of the Notes may fluctuate._**

The Issuer intends to make an application for listing on the Official List of Euronext Dublin and admission
to trading on the Global Exchange Market thereof, but it cannot assure you that the Notes will become or remain
listed. If the Issuer can no longer maintain the listing on the Official List of Euronext Dublin or it becomes
unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing (for the avoidance of doubt, the preparation of financial
statements in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards or any accounting standard other
than U.S. GAAP and any other standard pursuant to which VodafoneZiggo prepares its financial statements shall
constitute such undue burden), the Issuer may cease to make or maintain such listing on the Official List of
Euronext Dublin, provided that the Issuer will use all reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the
Notes on another stock exchange (which may be a stock exchange that is not regulated by the European Union),
although there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer
may at its sole option at any time, without the consent of the holders of the Notes or the Trustee, de-list the Notes
from any stock exchange for the purposes of moving the listing of such Notes to the Official List of The
International Stock Exchange.

The liquidity of any market for the Notes will depend on the number of holders of the Notes, the interest of
securities dealers in making a market in the Notes and other factors. Accordingly, the Issuer cannot assure you as
to the development or liquidity of any market for the Notes. If an active trading market does not develop, the
market price and liquidity of the Notes may be adversely affected. If the Notes are traded, they may trade at a
discount from their initial issue price depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities,
general economic conditions, the Issuer’s performance and business prospects and certain other factors.

Factors including the following may have a significant effect on the market price of the Notes:

    - actual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results of the Issuer, including its ability to generate cash
flow from operations;

    - perceived business prospects of the Issuer;

56


-----

    - ability or perceived ability of the Issuer to access capital markets and other sources of financing in the
future;

    - general economic conditions, including prevailing interest rates; and

    - the market for similar securities.

**_We may incur additional indebtedness prior to, or within a short time period following, the Issue Date of the_**
**_Notes, which indebtedness could increase our leverage and may have terms that are more or less favorable_**
**_than the terms of the Notes and our other existing indebtedness_**

We or our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt, including in connection with a refinancing of
our existing debt, to fund any future acquisition or for general corporate purposes. In connection with our
financial strategy, we continually evaluate different financing alternatives, and we may decide to enter into new
credit facilities, access the debt capital markets or incur other indebtedness from time to time, including
following the consummation of this offering and prior to, or within a short time period following, the Issue Date
of the Notes. Any such offering or incurrence of debt will be made at our election or the election of our relevant
subsidiaries, and if such debt is in the form of securities, would be offered and sold pursuant to, and on the terms
described in, a separate offering circular. The interest rate with respect to any such additional debt will be set at
the time of the pricing or incurrence of such debt and may be less than or greater than the interest rate applicable
to the Notes and our other existing debt, including, in the case of a refinancing, the debt that is being refinanced,
which would have a corresponding effect on our cash interest expense on a pro forma basis. In addition, the
maturity date of any such additional debt will be set at the time of pricing or incurrence of such debt and may be
earlier or later than the maturity date of the Notes and our other existing debt. The other terms of such additional
debt would be as agreed with the relevant lenders or holders thereof and could be more or less favorable than the
terms of the Notes or our other existing indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we or our subsidiaries will
elect to raise any such additional debt or that any effort to raise such debt will be successful, and there can be no
assurance as to the timing of such offering or incurrence, the amount or terms of any such additional debt. If we
incur new debt in addition to our current debt, the related risks that we now face, even in a refinancing
transaction, as described above and elsewhere in these “Risk Factors” could intensify.

**Risks Relating to the Receivables and the SCF Platform**

**_Receivables—payment, deduction and set-off risk_**

The principal risk associated with the Assigned Receivables is the risk of payment default by the Obligors.
A payment default could delay the payment of interest on the Notes on the date such interest is due, as well as the
return of principal in respect of the Notes beyond the Maturity Date and/or impair the amount of such return.

In order to constitute a VFZ Account Receivable, a Receivable must arise under an agreement pursuant to
which the relevant Buyer Entity has agreed not to assert any right of set-off, counterclaim or deduction save
those that have been specified in a Credit Note allocated to the Payment Obligation in respect of such Receivable
(though Credit Notes may not be allocated to any Payment Obligation following transfer of such Payment
Obligation through the SCF Platform). Depending on the jurisdiction of the relevant Buyer Entity or the Platform
Provider, such exclusion might not be effective in a liquidation or administration of such Buyer Entity or the
Platform Provider and mandatory set-off might be required. Furthermore, VFZ Accounts Receivable are
purchased by the Issuer at a price calculated after taking full account of any amounts specified in any Credit Note
(if any) allocated to the relevant Payment Obligation. In addition, the Platform Provider has also agreed to make
and calculate all payments to the Issuer without (and free and clear of any deduction for) set-off or counterclaim,
unless specifically provided for under the Framework Assignment Agreement.

**_Reliance on representations and warranties_**

The Issuer will purchase VFZ Accounts Receivable from the Platform Provider in reliance on
representations and warranties of the Buyer Parent and the Platform Provider in the Framework Assignment
Agreement. The Issuer will not carry out any independent investigation of the VFZ Accounts Receivable to be
purchased. The rights of the Issuer under these representations and warranties are charged in favour of the
Security Trustee under the Trust Deed.

**_The transfer of VFZ Accounts Receivable under the Framework Assignment Agreement takes place only_**
**_under equity until an Obligor Enforcement Notification is given to the Obligors_**

Pursuant to the terms of the Framework Assignment Agreement and notwithstanding that the Buyer Parent
gives certain representations relating to the VFZ Accounts Receivable pursuant to the terms of the Framework

57


-----

Assignment Agreement, the Issuer may not serve (or cause or permit to be served) an Obligor Enforcement
Notification prior to the occurrence of (i) a failure by the relevant Obligor to pay any Payment Obligation in full
to the Platform Provider on the date such payment was due (taking into account any applicable grace period
under the APMSA), (ii) a specified insolvency event in respect of any Obligor, (iii) a breach of the
representations and warranties of the Buyer Parent with respect to the eligibility of the VFZ Accounts
Receivable, which is not capable of remedy (or if such breach is capable of remedy, is not remedied within five
Business Days of notice) (each such event in (i) to (iii), an “Obligor Event of Default”), or (iv) a specified
insolvency event in respect of the Platform Provider. Accordingly, on each Assignment Date (as defined in
“General Description of VodafoneZiggo’s Business, the Issuer and the Offering—Overview of the Structure of
_the Offering of the Notes”), an assignment by the Platform Provider to the Issuer of a VFZ Account Receivable_
pursuant to the Framework Assignment Agreement will take place by way of an equitable assignment.

Under the terms of the Framework Assignment Agreement (see “Summary of Principal Documents—
_Framework Assignment Agreement” for a summary of the principal terms of the Framework Assignment_
Agreement), the Platform Provider will represent and warrant, immediately prior to each Assignment Date, inter
_alia, that it is entitled to assign the relevant Payment Obligations pursuant to the terms of the Framework_
Assignment Agreement, and that it has not assigned, transferred or otherwise disposed of, or created any
encumbrance or security interest over, such VFZ Accounts Receivable. Furthermore, the Buyer Parent will also
represent and warrant, pursuant to the terms of the Framework Assignment Agreement on each Assignment Date,
_inter alia, that the VFZ Accounts Receivable are capable of being freely and validly transferred in the manner_
provided by the Framework Assignment Agreement so that on purchase the Issuer will receive good title, and
that the VFZ Accounts Receivable are due and payable in full without any right of set-off, counterclaim or
deduction in favour of the Buyer Entities.

Notwithstanding the representations and warranties provided by the Buyer Parent and the Platform Provider,
until an Obligor Enforcement Notification is given to the Obligors and the assignment is otherwise elevated to a
full legal assignment in accordance with the terms of the Framework Assignment Agreement, the Issuer would
not take priority over any interest of a later encumbrancer or transferee of the legal title to the Platform
Provider’s rights who had no notice of the transfer to the Issuer. This may materially and adversely affect the
Issuer’s ability to make payments under the Notes.

**_Commingling of amounts due to the Issuer in the SCF Bank Account may delay or reduce payments on the_**
**_Notes_**

Until an Obligor Enforcement Notification is given to the Obligors, each Obligor will discharge its payment
obligations under the Assigned Receivables by making payment to the Platform Provider’s SCF Bank Account.

The APMSA provides that the uploading of an Electronic Data File containing details of a Receivable onto
the SCF Platform, and the designation of such uploaded Receivable as “approved” by a Buyer Entity, will
initially give rise to a Parent Payment Obligation, an independent and primary obligation by VodafoneZiggo to
make payment or cause payment to be made to the relevant recipient on the Confirmed Payment Date in respect
of such Receivable. Upon each sale and assignment of a Parent Payment Obligation and the related Receivable
from the Supplier to the Platform Provider through the SCF Platform, a Payment Obligation (which will be a new
independent and primary, irrevocable, legal, valid and binding payment obligation) will arise whereby each
Obligor will become jointly and severally liable with each other Obligor to make payment or cause payment to
be made to the relevant recipient on the Confirmed Payment Date in respect of such Receivable. Prior to the
service of an Obligor Enforcement Notification, such payments will be made by the Obligors to the Platform
Provider’s SCF Bank Account to satisfy the Payment Obligation comprising an Assigned Receivable on the
relevant Confirmed Payment Date; the Obligors will also make payments to the SCF Bank Account to satisfy
Payment Obligations owing to other Relevant Recipients (who are not the Issuer) participating in the SCF
Platform. In turn, the Platform Provider will act as collection agent for the Issuer pursuant to the terms of the
Framework Assignment Agreement, and has agreed to pay each amount received in respect of an Assigned
Receivable into the relevant Issuer Transaction Account (although the Platform Provider may validly retain and
reinvest certain amounts on the Issuer’s behalf; see “General Description of VodafoneZiggo’s Business, the
_Issuer and the Offering—Overview of the Structure of the Offering of the Notes”) and to notify the Issuer as soon_
as reasonably practicable if all or any part of an Assigned Receivable is not paid in full on the date such payment
was due (taking into account any applicable grace period under the APMSA).

Therefore, any amounts that are paid by the Obligors into the SCF Bank Account in connection with the
settlement of Assigned Receivables are at risk of being commingled with other funds paid by the Obligors into

58


-----

the same account in connection with the settlement of Payment Obligations owing to other Relevant Recipients.
If cash collected upon the settlement of Assigned Receivables and due to the Issuer is commingled with other
funds (including funds due to other Relevant Recipients) in the SCF Bank Account, it may not be traceable, such
that upon the insolvency of any of the Obligors, it may be impossible to separate the amounts due to the Issuer
from amounts due to other creditors of the Obligors (including other Relevant Recipients). If there is a shortfall
in the amounts necessary to satisfy the claims of all creditors in such an event, this may reduce amounts available
to pay Noteholders.

**_Reliance on the Platform Provider acting as paying agent for the Obligors and as collection agent for the_**
**_Issuer under the SCF Platform Documents and the Framework Assignment Agreement may lead to a loss on_**
**_the Notes_**

Pursuant to the terms of the APMSA the Obligors authorize the Platform Provider as paying agent with
respect to transactions executed on the SCF Platform. On the Confirmed Payment Date for a VFZ Account
Receivable, the Platform Provider will debit the SCF Bank Account for the amount collected from the relevant
Obligor in connection with the settlement of such VFZ Account Receivable, and will forward such amounts to
the Issuer or such other participating funding provider that purchased the VFZ Account Receivable.

The Platform Provider, acting as paying agent for the Obligors pursuant to the APMSA and as collection
agent for the Issuer under the Framework Assignment Agreement, must make payments to the Issuer net of any
deduction or withholding required to be made from such payments by any law, regulation or practice, and the
Issuer will bear the risk of such deduction or withholding. Moreover, save in the case of breach of contract, gross
negligence or wilful misconduct, the Platform Provider is not: (a) responsible for any loss or liability arising out
of its failure, owing to causes outside its control (such as, but not limited to, the imposition of foreign exchange
restrictions or any act or omission of any Obligor) to remit to the Issuer any amount due to it under the
Framework Assignment Agreement or any Assignment Framework Note; or (b) liable to remit to the Issuer any
amount greater than the amount actually collected from an Obligor in connection with the settlement of an
Assigned Receivable, notwithstanding the fact that such amount may be less than the Certified Amount due and
payable. Additionally, where any amount is owed by an Obligor in respect of an Assigned Receivable, the
Platform Provider is not obliged to pay any part of such amount to the Issuer until it has been able to establish to
its satisfaction that it has actually received such amount from the Obligor. In connection therewith, the Platform
Provider benefits from a clawback provision in the Framework Assignment Agreement which provides that, save
for the Platform Provider’s gross negligence or wilful misconduct, if at any time (including after termination of
the Framework Assignment Agreement) the Platform Provider pays an amount to the Issuer which the Platform
Provider either did not actually receive or is required to return to the relevant Obligor or any third party by
operation of mandatory rules of law, then the Issuer must, on demand, refund such amount to the Platform
Provider, together with interest (if any) accrued thereon from the date which is five Business Days following the
date of demand to the date of refund.

Any of the circumstances described above may result in a delay in payments to Noteholders under the Notes
or permanent reduction in amounts available to pay Noteholders under the Notes.

**_Exposure to credit risk of the Platform Provider_**

As of the Issue Date, the Platform Provider pursuant to the terms of the Framework Assignment Agreement
and the SCF Platform Documents will be ING Bank N.V., an entity incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands
with registered number 33031431 and acting through its office at Bijlmerplein 888, 1102 MG Amsterdam, the
Netherlands, and which, in its ordinary course of business, provides wholesale banking services (including trade
receivables finance products such as the SCF Platform through which it assigns Payment Obligations (and, where
applicable, the related Receivables) to various participating funders, including the Issuer).

Pursuant to the Framework Assignment Agreement, the Issuer agrees to allow the Platform Provider to
retain, on the Issuer’s behalf (for a specified period), certain amounts which would otherwise be due to the
Issuer. This arrangement provides the Platform Provider with additional liquidity to purchase, on the Issuer’s
behalf, further VFZ Accounts Receivable as and when they become available on the SCF Platform; it also
enhances operational efficiency by minimizing unnecessary or redundant payment flows between the Issuer and
the Platform Provider. In exchange, the Platform Provider agrees to pay interest on certain of these retained
amounts, which accrues on a daily basis at a fixed margin over 1-month EURIBOR, for the period of retention.
The Framework Assignment Agreement also permits the Platform Provider to hold certain other funds (which
would otherwise be due to the Issuer) for a fixed period of time, without accruing interest, and such funds may or

59


-----

may not be applied for the Issuer’s benefit towards further purchases of VFZ Accounts Receivable; provided,
_however, that the Platform Provider may not retain any amounts otherwise due to the Issuer and which are not_
invested in VFZ Accounts Receivable for longer than four Business Days from the relevant date of receipt and/or
in an aggregate amount greater than €50.0 million at any time. For more information on the forms of liquidity
provided by the Issuer to the Platform Provider to purchase VFZ Accounts Receivable on the Issuers’ behalf
under the Framework Assignment Agreement, see “General Description of VodafoneZiggo’s Business, the Issuer
_and the Offering—Overview of the Structure of the Offering of the Notes” found elsewhere in this Offering_
Circular.

The Issuer will, therefore, be exposed to the credit risk related to the Platform Provider as counterparty to
the Framework Assignment Agreement to the extent of the cash of the Issuer held by the Platform Provider. If
the credit quality of the Platform Provider deteriorates, it may default on its obligation to make payments
thereunder. In the event of the insolvency of the Platform Provider, the Issuer will be treated as a general creditor
of the Platform Provider, and may not be able to recover any of its funds held thereby. Furthermore, there may be
practical impediments or timing delays associated with enforcement of the Issuer’s rights against the Platform
Provider in the case of its insolvency. A failure by the Platform Provider to make payment when due to the Issuer
of any relevant funds it holds, together with, if applicable, any interest accrued thereon, would reduce the funds
available to the Issuer to perform its obligations, which could result in a reduction or delay in payments on the
Notes.

In the event of a Ratings Trigger Event, the Issuer will deliver a notice of termination under the Framework
Assignment Agreement, and will not be obliged to fund further purchases of VFZ Accounts Receivable (to the
extent an Assignment Notice has not been served or deemed to have been served in respect thereof prior to the
date of service of the notice of termination).

The short term, unsecured, unguaranteed and unsubordinated debt obligations of ING Bank N.V. are rated
“F1+” by Fitch, “P-1” by Moody’s and “A-1” by S&P. The long term, unsecured, unguaranteed and
unsubordinated debt obligations of ING Bank N.V. are rated “A+” by Fitch, “Aa3” by Moody’s and “A+” by
S&P.

In the case of an SCF Platform Addition or an SCF Platform Replacement, which may be established
without the consent of the Noteholders, a different entity may be appointed as Platform Provider and such
appointment does not require the consent of the Noteholders. There can be no assurance on the level of exposure
to the credit risk of such new or replacement Platform Provider.

**_The Framework Assignment Agreement may be terminated without the consent of the Issuer or the_**
**_Noteholders_**

The Issuer depends on its rights under the Framework Assignment Agreement to access the SCF Platform
and to purchase eligible VFZ Accounts Receivable, the repayment of which at a premium (in conjunction with
certain payments from the New VFZ Facilities Borrower pursuant to the New VFZ Facilities Agreement) allows
the Issuer to service its obligations under the Notes. Further, the Issuer has no control over how frequently the
VFZ Accounts Receivables will be offered to it for purchase under the Framework Assignment Agreement, and
there is no minimum number of Assignment Framework Notes or sale of VFZ Accounts Receivables under the
Framework Assignment Agreement. Under its terms, the Framework Assignment Agreement and/or any
Assignment Framework Note thereunder may be terminated by the Platform Provider, without the consent of the
Issuer or the Noteholders, upon provision of 10 Business Days’ prior written notice to the Issuer, provided that
the effective date of such termination shall not be earlier than the effective date of termination of the APMSA.
The Platform Provider may also terminate the Framework Assignment Agreement and/or any Assignment
Framework Note with immediate effect upon the occurrence of certain events, including a breach of material
obligations of the Buyer Parent (subject to a 30 days grace period), a material breach of the representation and
warranties of the Buyer Parent (subject to a 30 days grace period), or if a specified insolvency event has occurred
in respect of the Buyer Parent. Termination of the Framework Assignment Agreement shall preclude the service
of further Assignment Notices, thus preventing the Issuer from purchasing further VFZ Accounts Receivable, in
which case the Issuer would be dependent upon (i) the repayment of any Assigned Receivables outstanding prior
to such termination and (ii) payments from the New VFZ Facilities Borrower pursuant to the New VFZ Facilities
Agreement to fund interest payments on the Notes. Upon repayment of any outstanding Assigned Receivables,
funding of payments on the Notes would no longer benefit from the purchase and repayment of VFZ Accounts
Receivable. In such case the Issuer would be entirely dependent upon payments by the New VFZ Facilities
Borrower and VZ Financing I B.V. to which the Issuer is entitled under the New VFZ Facilities Agreement

60


-----

(including any Shortfall Payments) and Expenses Agreement, as applicable, to fund payments under the Notes.
See “—The Issuer is an unaffiliated special purpose financing company which will depend on payments in
_respect of the Assigned Receivables, the New VFZ Facilities Agreement and the Expenses Agreement to provide_
_it with funds to meet its obligations under the Notes” and “—Limited recourse obligations”._

**_Reliance on third parties_**

Each of the Notes Trustee, the Security Trustee and the Issuer is a party to arrangements with a number of
other third parties that have agreed to perform certain services in relation to the VFZ Accounts Receivable and
the New VFZ Facilities Agreement, as further described in “Summary of Principal Documents—Agency and
_Account Bank Agreement” included elsewhere in this Offering Circular. For example, the Administrator has_
agreed to provide certain portfolio administration and calculation services, the Account Bank has agreed to
provide certain cash management services and the Paying Agent has agreed to provide payment services, in each
case either itself or through its delegates, in respect of the VFZ Accounts Receivable and New VFZ Facilities
Loans under the Agency and Account Bank Agreement. Each of the Notes Trustee, the Security Trustee and the
Issuer will rely on the relevant third party or its delegate to exercise the rights and carry out the obligations under
the Agency and Account Bank Agreement. In the event that any relevant third party or its delegate fails to
perform its obligations under the respective agreement, the Notes may be adversely affected. For example,
disruptions in the duties of the Administrator, which may be caused by the failure to appoint a successor or the
failure of the Administrator to carry out its services, could lead to a loss on the Notes. Each of the Issuer and the
Security Trustee may, from time to time, become subject to regulatory or other requirements that may require it
to appoint additional third parties (or increase the level of responsibility of an existing third party) to provide
relevant services and/or incur additional costs and expenses to enable it to comply with such regulatory
requirements. The Issuer and the Security Trustee, as the case may be, could be in breach of regulatory
requirements or otherwise adversely affected if they were unable to find a third party to provide the relevant
services or perform them themselves. Moreover, such regulatory requirements may give rise to additional costs
and expenses for the affected entity which would be payable prior to payments with respect to the Notes and
thereby reduce amounts available to make such payments under the Notes.

**_Termination of the Administrator may cause disruptions in processes that could affect the timeliness of_**
**_payments on the Notes_**

If the appointment of The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch as Administrator is terminated under
the terms of the Agency and Account Bank Agreement, it will be necessary for the Issuer to appoint a successor
to undertake the obligations of the Administrator. See “Summary of Principal Documents—Agency and Account
_Bank Agreement” for a description of the circumstances in which termination of the Administrator may occur and_
the consequences of such termination. The transfer to a new Administrator may create disruptions in processes
that could cause delays in the payments received by the Issuer and, ultimately, in payments due on the Notes.

**Investment Company Act**

**_Restrictions on Ownership of Notes and the Investment Company Act_**

The Notes will be sold only to Eligible Non-U.S. Persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation
S. The Issuer has not registered with the SEC as an investment company pursuant to the Investment Company
Act, in reliance on the exception contained in Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. Section 3(c)(7) of
the Investment Company Act provides that an entity will not be within the statutory definition of “investment
company” so long as (a) such entity’s outstanding securities offered within the U.S. are owned exclusively by
U.S. residents that are “qualified purchasers” at the time of acquisition of such securities and (b) such entity does
not make, or propose to make, a public offering of its securities in the United States. In some cases persons who
would not otherwise be deemed to be qualified purchasers can own securities of the entity, such as
“knowledgeable employees” of the entity and certain transferees identified in Rules 3c-5 or 3c-6 under the
Investment Company Act. In addition, resales of the Notes in a transaction exempt from the registration
requirements under the U.S. Securities Act, as the case may be, are restricted as described under “Transfer
_Restrictions”._

No opinion or no-action position has been requested of the SEC with respect to the status of the Issuer as an
investment company under the Investment Company Act.

If the SEC or a court of competent jurisdiction were to find that the Issuer is required, but in violation of the
Investment Company Act, had failed, to register as an investment company, possible consequences include, but

61


-----

are not limited to, the following: (i) the SEC could apply to a district court to enjoin the violation; (ii) investors in
the Issuer could sue the Issuer and recover any damages caused by the violation; and (iii) any contract to which
the Issuer is party that is made in violation of the Investment Company Act or whose performance involves such
violation would be unenforceable by any party to the contract unless a court were to find that under the
circumstances enforcement would produce a more equitable result than non-enforcement and would not be
inconsistent with the purposes of the Investment Company Act. In addition, such a finding would constitute an
Issuer Event of Default under the Conditions. Should the Issuer be subjected to any or all of the foregoing, the
Issuer would be materially and adversely affected.

**Risks Relating to Our Financial Profile**

**_Our substantial leverage could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and_**
**_prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the Notes._**

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of 30 June 2019 the total principal amount of third-party
borrowings of VodafoneZiggo was €10.9 billion (equivalent) (which includes finance lease obligations). We also
had €800.0 million available to draw under the Revolving Credit Facility (which represents the entire amount
available thereunder).

We may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Although the Existing Credit Facility, and the
indentures governing the Existing Notes will and/or do contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional
indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under
certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions
could be substantial. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the related risks that
we now face would increase. In addition, the aforementioned indentures and the Existing Credit Facility will not
prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements. Our
indebtedness, as defined in the aforementioned arrangements, is not affected by the adoption of ASU No. 201602, Leases (ASU 2016-02), as of 1 January 2019. By adopting this ASU 2016-02 we will recognize substantial
lease liabilities and substantial right-of-use assets.

Further, the indentures governing the Existing Notes and the Existing Credit Facility each allow us, in
certain circumstances, to make dividend payments and to make other distributions under the applicable covenants
thereunder limiting restricted payments or to make minority investments or investments in joint ventures. See the
discussions under the heading “Description of Other Indebtedness” for further information about our substantial
debt.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy
our debt obligations, and in turn, the Issuer’s ability to satisfy its obligations under the Notes offered hereby.

In addition, the Existing Credit Facility and the indentures governing the Existing Notes contain financial
and other restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best
interests, including, among other things, borrowing additional funds. These restrictions are subject to significant
exceptions. Our failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default under the Existing
Credit Facility and/or the Existing Notes, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all our
debts or have a similar material adverse effect on us.

We may incur substantial additional debt in the future, including in connection with any future acquisition.
In connection with our financial strategy, we continually evaluate different financing alternatives, and we may
decide to enter into new credit facilities, or incur other indebtedness from time to time, including during the
period following the consummation of this offering. If we incur new debt in addition to our current debt, the
related risks that we now face, as described above and elsewhere in these “Risk Factors”, could intensify.

**_Our substantial leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing and have other adverse effects._**

We seek to maintain our debt at levels that provide for attractive equity returns without assuming undue
risk. In this regard, we generally seek to maintain our debt at levels that result in a consolidated debt balance that
is less than 5.0 times our Covenant EBITDA (as defined herein and Note 11 of the 2018 Annual Report). At
30 June 2019, the principal amount of our total third-party outstanding debt and finance lease obligations was
approximately €10.9 billion (equivalent). We believe that we have sufficient resources to repay or refinance the
current portion of our debt and finance lease obligations and to fund our foreseeable liquidity requirements

62


-----

during the next 12 months. However, as our debt maturities grow in later years, we anticipate that we will seek to
refinance or otherwise extend our debt maturities. No assurance can be given that we will be able to refinance or
otherwise extend our debt maturities in light of the current market conditions. In this regard, it is not possible to
predict how economic conditions, sovereign debt concerns and/or any adverse regulatory developments could
impact the credit markets we access and, accordingly, our future liquidity and financial position.

Our ability to service or refinance our debt and to maintain compliance with our leverage covenants is
dependent primarily on our ability to maintain or increase our Covenant EBITDA and to achieve adequate
returns on our capital expenditures and acquisitions. Accordingly, if our Covenant EBITDA declines or we
encounter other material liquidity requirements, we may be required to seek additional debt financing in order to
meet our debt obligations and other liquidity requirements as they come due. In addition, our current debt levels
may limit our ability to incur additional debt financing to fund capital expenditures, working capital needs,
acquisitions, or other general corporate requirements. We can give no assurance that any additional debt
financing will be available on terms that are as favorable as the terms of our existing debt or at all.

**_We may incur additional indebtedness prior to, or within a short time period following, the Issue Date of the_**
**_Notes, which indebtedness could increase our leverage and may have terms that are more or less favorable_**
**_than the terms of the Notes and our other existing indebtedness._**

We may incur substantial additional indebtedness, including to refinance our existing indebtedness, to fund
any future acquisition or for general corporate purposes, which may include loans, distributions or other
payments to our direct or indirect shareholders or share buybacks. Such additional indebtedness may include the
incurrence of Further Notes issued by the Issuer under the Trust Deed and the upsizing of VodafoneZiggo’s
existing indebtedness. In connection with our financial strategy, we continually evaluate different financing
alternatives, and may decide to enter into new credit facilities, access the debt capital markets (including through
an additional term loan facility or the entry into additional financing arrangements, funded with the proceeds of
notes issued by the Issuer or another financing company) or incur other indebtedness from time to time, including
following the consummation of this offering and prior to, or within a short time period following, the Issue Date
of the Notes. Any such offering or incurrence of debt will be made at our election, and if such debt is in the form
of securities (including Further Notes under the Trust Deed), would be offered and sold pursuant to, and on the
terms described in, a separate offering circular. The interest rate with respect to any such additional indebtedness
will be set at the time of the pricing or incurrence of such indebtedness and, to the extent the interest rate is
greater than the interest rate applicable to any indebtedness that is refinanced, or to the extent of any incremental
indebtedness, such offering or incurrence would be expected to increase our cash interest expense on a pro forma
basis. In addition, the maturity date of any such additional indebtedness will be set at the time of pricing of such
incurrence or offering and may be earlier or later than the maturity date of the Notes. The other terms of such
additional debt would be as agreed with the relevant lenders or holders thereof and could be more or less
favorable than the terms of the Notes or our other existing indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we will
elect to raise any such additional debt or that any effort to raise such debt will be successful, and there can be no
assurance as to the timing of such offering or incurrence, the amount or terms of any such additional debt. If we
incur new debt in addition to its current debt, the related risks that we now face, even in a refinancing transaction,
as described above and elsewhere in these “Risk Factors”, could intensify.

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service obligations._**

Our ability to make interest payments on the Existing Notes and to meet our other debt service obligations,
including under the Existing Credit Facility, and the Existing Notes, or to refinance our debt, depends on our
future operating and financial performance, which will be affected by our ability to successfully implement our
business strategy as well as general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond our
control. If we cannot generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service requirements, we may, among other things,
need to refinance all or a portion of our debt, obtain additional financing, delay planned capital expenditures or
investments or sell material assets.

If we are not able to refinance any of our debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets on commercially
reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to satisfy our debt obligations under the Existing Notes. In that
event, borrowings under other debt agreements or instruments that contain cross default or cross acceleration
provisions may become payable on demand, and we may not have sufficient funds to repay all of our debts. See
“Description of Other Indebtedness”.

63


-----

**_We are subject to debt covenants that could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations and_**
**_capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities._**

The indentures governing the Existing Notes, and other agreements governing our indebtedness (including
the Existing Credit Facility) contain covenants that significantly restrict our ability to, among other things:

    - incur or guarantee additional debt or issue certain preferred stock;

    - pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make certain investments;

    - make certain other restricted payments;

    - create or permit to exist certain liens;

    - impose restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us;

    - transfer, lease or sell certain assets including subsidiary stock;

    - merge or consolidate with other entities;

    - enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

    - enter into unrelated businesses; and

    - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Existing Notes.

All of these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications, including the ability to pay
dividends, make investments or to make significant prepayments of related-party debt. However, these covenants
could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business
opportunities and activities that may be in our interest.

In addition to limiting our flexibility in operating our business, the breach of any covenants or obligations
under the agreements governing our debt may result in a default under the applicable debt agreement and could
trigger acceleration of the related debt. Such a default or acceleration could in turn trigger defaults under other
agreements governing our debt. A default under the agreements governing our other debt could materially
adversely affect our growth, our financial condition and results of operations and result in us not having
sufficient assets to fulfil the obligations under the relevant series of Existing Notes. See “Description of Other
_Indebtedness”._

**_We are exposed to interest rate risks. Shifts in such rates may adversely affect our debt service obligations._**

We are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates, primarily under the Existing Credit Facility,
which are indexed to EURIBOR and LIBOR rates. Although we enter into various derivative transactions to
manage exposure to movements in interest rates, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do
so at a reasonable cost or at all. If we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate exposure through
derivative transactions, any increase in market interest rates would increase our interest rate exposure and debt
service obligations, which would exacerbate the risks associated with our leveraged capital structure.

In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it
intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. Currently, it is not
possible to predict the exact transitional arrangements for calculating applicable reference rates that may be made
in the U.K., the U.S., the Eurozone or elsewhere given that a number of outcomes are possible, including the
cessation of the publication of one or more reference rates. Our loan documents contain provisions that
contemplate alternative calculations of the base rate applicable to our LIBOR-indexed debt to the extent LIBOR
is not available, which alternative calculations we do not anticipate will be materially different from what would
have been calculated under LIBOR. Additionally, no mandatory prepayment or redemption provisions would be
triggered under our loan documents in the event that the LIBOR rate is not available. It is possible, however, that
any new reference rate that applies to our LIBOR-indexed debt could be different than any new reference rate
that applies to our LIBOR-indexed derivative instruments. We anticipate managing this difference and any
resulting increased variable-rate exposure through modifications to our debt and/or derivative instruments,
however future market conditions may not allow immediate implementation of desired modifications and/or the
company may incur significant associated costs.

**_We are exposed to various foreign currency exchange rate risks._**

The functional currency of our operations is the euro. Accordingly, we are exposed to foreign currency
exchange risk with respect to our dollar denominated debt, which includes Term Loan Facility E (as defined in

64


-----

“Description of Other Indebtedness of VodafoneZiggo—Existing Credit Facility”), the 2027 Dollar Senior
Secured Notes, the 2025 Dollar Senior Notes and the 2027 Senior Notes. Although we generally seek to match
the denomination of our borrowings, and the borrowings of our subsidiaries, with the euro, market conditions or
other factors may cause us to enter into borrowing arrangements that are not denominated in the euro. With
respect to Term Loan Facility E, the 2027 Dollar Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Dollar Senior Notes and the
2027 Senior Notes, we have entered into currency swaps to synthetically convert the interest and principal
payments due under the Term Loan Facility E, 2027 Dollar Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Dollar Senior Notes
and the 2027 Senior Notes into euro for a period up until the respective maturity date of the Term Loan Facility
E, 2027 Dollar Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Dollar Senior Notes and the 2027 Senior Notes.

**_Disruptions in the credit and equity markets could increase the risk of default by the counterparties to our_**
**_derivative and other financial instruments, undrawn debt facilities and cash investments and may impact our_**
**_future financial position._**

Although we seek to manage the credit risks associated with our derivative and other financial instruments,
cash investments and undrawn debt facilities, we are exposed to the risk that our counterparties could default on
their obligations to us. While we regularly review our credit exposures and currently have no specific concerns
about the creditworthiness of any counterparty for which we have material credit risk exposures, we cannot rule
out the possibility that one or more of our counterparties could fail or otherwise be unable to meet its obligations
to us. Any such instance of default or failure could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of
operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. In this regard, (1) we may incur losses to the extent that we are
unable to recover debts owed to us, including cash deposited and the value of financial losses, (2) we may incur
significant costs to recover amounts owed to us, and such recovery may take a long period of time or may not be
possible at all, (3) our derivative liabilities may be accelerated by the default of our counterparty, (4) we may be
exposed to financial risks as a result of the termination of affected derivative contracts, and it may be costly or
impossible to replace such contracts or otherwise mitigate such risks, (5) amounts available under committed
credit facilities may be reduced and (6) disruption to the credit markets could adversely impact our ability to
access debt financing on favourable terms, or at all. At 30 June 2019, our exposure to counterparty credit risk
included (1) derivative assets with an aggregate fair value of €0.8 million, (2) cash and cash equivalent and
restricted cash balances of €343.2 million and (3) aggregate undrawn debt facilities of €800.0 million.

Furthermore, under our derivative contracts, it is generally only the non-defaulting party that has a
contractual option to exercise early termination rights upon the default of the other counterparty and to set off
other liabilities against sums due upon such termination. However, in an insolvency of a derivative counterparty,
under the laws of certain jurisdictions, the defaulting counterparty or its insolvency representatives may be able
to compel the termination of one or more derivative contracts and trigger early termination payment liabilities
payable by us, reflecting any mark-to-market value of the contracts for the counterparty. Alternatively, or in
addition, the insolvency laws of certain jurisdictions may require the mandatory set off of amounts due under
such derivative contracts against present and future liabilities owed to us under other contracts between us and
the relevant counterparty. Accordingly, it is possible that we may be subject to obligations to make payments, or
may have present or future liabilities owed to us partially or fully discharged by set off as a result of such
obligations, in the event of the insolvency of a derivative counterparty, even though it is the counterparty that is
in default and not us. To the extent that we are required to make such payments, our ability to do so will depend
on our liquidity and capital resources at the time. In an insolvency of a defaulting counterparty, we will be an
unsecured creditor in respect of any amount owed to us by the defaulting counterparty, except to the extent of the
value of any collateral we have obtained from that counterparty. Furthermore, the underlying risks that are the
subject of the relevant derivative contracts would no longer be effectively hedged due to the insolvency of our
counterparty, unless and until we novate or replace the derivative contract.

In addition, where a counterparty is in financial difficulty, under the laws of certain jurisdictions, the
relevant regulators may be able to (i) compel the termination of one or more derivative instruments, determine
the settlement amount and/or compel, without any payment, the partial or full discharge of liabilities arising from
such early termination that are payable by the relevant counterparty or (ii) transfer the derivative instruments to
an alternative counterparty. However, no assurance can be given that the relevant regulators would in fact do so
or that such actions would not result in substantial costs to us.

**Risks Relating to Our Industry and Our Business**

**_We operate in increasingly competitive markets, and there is a risk that we will not be able to effectively_**
**_compete with other service providers._**

The Netherlands market for video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services is highly
competitive and rapidly evolving. Technological advances and product innovations have increased and are likely
to continue to increase giving customers several options for the provision of their telecommunications services.
Our customers want access to high quality telecommunication services that allow for seamless connectivity.
Accordingly, our ability to offer converged services (video, internet, fixed telephone and mobile) is a key
component of our strategy. We compete with companies that provide fixed-mobile convergence bundles, as well
as companies that are established in one or more communication products and services. Consequently, our
business faces significant competition.

For all our services, we compete with the provision of similar services from operator Koninklijke KPN N.V.
(“KPN”), Tele2 Netherlands Holding B.V. (“Tele2” as of January 2019 merged with T-Mobile), T-Mobile
Netherlands B.V. (“T-Mobile”) and smaller parties. KPN and other competitors using KPN’s fixed network offer
(i) internet protocol television (“IPTV”) over fiber optic lines where the fiber is to the home, cabinet, or building
or to the node networks (fiber-to-the-home/-cabinet/-building/-node is referred to herein as “FTTx”) networks
and through broadband internet connections using DSL or very high-speed DSL technology (“VDSL”), KPN’s
network also offers several enhancements to VDSL, such as “vectoring” and “pair bonding”, and (ii) digital
terrestrial television (“DTT”). Where KPN has enhanced its VDSL system, it allows for offers of broadband
internet with download speeds of up to 150 Mbps and on its FTTx networks, it allows for download speeds of up
to 500 Mbps. The ability of competitors to offer a bundled triple-play of video, broadband internet and telephony
services and fixed-mobile convergence services, creates significant competitive pressure on our operations,
including the pricing and bundling of our video products. The video services of competitors include many of the
interactive features we offer our subscribers (e.g. KPN introduced a new set-top box that is capable of 4K TV
that is expected to enhance the video experience for its customers). Portions of our network have been overbuilt
by KPN’s and other providers’ FTTx networks and expansion of these networks is expected to continue.

We also experience competition from (i) direct-to-home satellite (“DTH”) service providers, such as Canal
Digital, a subsidiary of M7 Group S.A., (ii) OTT video content aggregators utilizing our or our competitors’
high-speed internet connections, and (iii) movie theaters, video websites and home video products. In addition,
we compete to varying degrees with other sources of information and entertainment, such as online
entertainment, newspapers, magazines, books, live entertainment/ concerts and sporting events. Free-to-air
television is not a significant competitive factor because the Netherlands is predominately a pay television
market.

We compete with KPN and T-Mobile (Tele2 as of January 2019 merged with T-Mobile) in the mobile
market, offering 2G, 3G and 4G services, where pressure on market price continues, characterized by aggressive
promotional campaigns, heavy marketing spend and increasing (data) bundles. Furthermore, there is increasing
competition from MVNOs, some of which focus on niche segments. While in the business market, we see
growing customer requirements to provide unified communication solutions with a focus on employee mobility,
seamless fixed and mobile transition and digital workspace.

Connectivity Services in the high end business market are also offered by competitors like Eurofiber
(nationwide fiber access services) and international service providers like British Telecom, Colt, etc.

In the business segment we also compete with service providers offering ‘value added services’, mostly in
OTT service models based on Hosted Cloud technologies. These can be both local providers with nationwide
coverage and international cloud hosting providers like Microsoft, Amazon Web Services and IBM.

Changes in market share are driven primarily by the combination of price and quality of services provided.
To improve our competitive position, we continuously monitor and update our portfolios.

We offer attractive bundle options, plus fixed-mobile convergence options, allowing our subscribers the
ability to select various combinations of services to meet their needs. Our competitive strategy with respect to our
services includes:

    - Video services: We include MediaBox XL, MediaBox Next, Replay TV and Movies & Series in our
extended digital video tier offers. Ziggo GO is also available, providing subscribers the ability to watch

66


-----

linear and VoD programming through a second or third screen application on smart phones, tablets and
laptops and to record programs remotely. We introduced MediaBox Next in March 2019, which
provides a new 4K next-generation TV entertainment platform to subscribers. In addition, we continue
to improve the quality of our programming and modify our video options by offering attractive content
packages.

    - Mobile services: We offer a wide range of 2G, 3G and 4G mobile services and are expanding our
Community WiFi network. We also continue to invest in our mobile network to improve the
availability and quality of our services.

    - Broadband internet services: We promote our speeds of up to 500 Mbps in the consumer market
(600Mbps at B2B) and we seek to increase the maximum speed of our connections by fully utilizing
the technical capabilities of EURO DOCSIS 3.0 and DOCSIS 3.1 technologies of our cable system. We
expect the internet speeds on our network will continue to increase with the deployment of our next
generation gateways in our cable networks.

    - Fixed-line telephony services: We position our services as “anytime” and “anywhere” and offer a
variety of innovative calling plans to meet the needs of our customers, such as national or international
calling, unlimited off-peak calling and minute packages, including calls to fixed and mobile phones.

We expect the level and intensity of competition to continue to increase from both existing competitors and
new market entrants as a result of changes in the Dutch and European regulatory framework of the industries in
which we operate, advances in technology, the influx of new market entrants and strategic alliances and
cooperative relationships among industry participants. Increased competition could result in increased customer
churn, reductions of customer acquisition rates for some products and services and significant price competition.
In combination with difficult economic environments, these competitive pressures could adversely impact our
ability to increase or, in certain cases, maintain the revenue, ARPU, RGUs, OCF and liquidity of our operations.

**_Our business is concentrated in the Netherlands._**

We operate exclusively in the Dutch market and our success is therefore closely tied to general economic
developments in the Netherlands and cannot be offset by developments in other markets. Negative developments
in the Dutch economy, in particular with elevated levels of unemployment and a housing market which is still in
recovery coupled with negative developments arising from the ongoing struggles in Europe relating to sovereign
debt issues, may have a direct adverse impact on the spending patterns of retail consumers, both in terms of the
products they subscribe for and usage levels. Unfavorable economic conditions may impact a significant number
of our current and potential subscribers and, as a result, it may be (i) more difficult to attract new subscribers,
(ii) more likely that subscribers will downgrade or disconnect their services and (iii) more difficult to maintain
our existing ARPU level. Accordingly, our ability to increase or maintain our revenue, ARPU, RGUs and OCF,
as the case may be, operating cash flow, operating cash flow margin and liquidity could be adversely affected if
the economic environment remains uncertain or declines further. Negative changes in demand as a result of a
declining economic environment could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating cash flow.

**_Our property and equipment additions may not generate a positive return._**

The television, broadband internet, fixed-telephony and mobile communications businesses in which we
operate are capital intensive. Significant additions to our property and equipment are required to add customers
to our networks and to upgrade our broadband communications networks and CPE to enhance our service
offerings and improve the customer experience. Such expansion and improvements require significant capital
expenditures for equipment and associated labor costs. Significant competition, the introduction of new
technologies, the expansion of existing technologies, such as FTTx and advanced DSL, or adverse regulatory
developments could cause us to decide to undertake previously unplanned upgrades of our networks and CPE. In
addition, no assurance can be given that any future upgrades will generate a positive return or that we will have
adequate capital available to finance such future upgrades. If we are unable to, or elect not to, pay for costs
associated with adding new customers, expanding or upgrading our networks or making our other planned or
unplanned additions to our property and equipment, our growth could be limited, and our competitive position
could be harmed.

**_Adverse economic developments could reduce customer spending for our cable television, broadband, fixed-_**
**_line telephony and mobile services and increase churn._**

Customer churn is a measure of the number of customers who stop subscribing for one or more of our
products or services. Churn arises mainly as a result of competitive influences, relocation of subscribers,

67


-----

deterioration of personal financial circumstances and price increases. In addition, our customer churn rate may
also increase if we are unable to deliver satisfactory services. For example, any interruption or unavailability of
our services, which may not be under our control, could contribute to increased customer churn. Increased
customer churn may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.

Most of our revenue is derived from customers who could be impacted by adverse economic developments
globally, in Europe and in the Netherlands. Ongoing struggles in Europe related to sovereign debt issues, among
other things, has contributed to a challenging economic environment. Accordingly, unfavorable economic
conditions may impact a significant number of our customers and, as a result, it may be (i) more difficult for us
to attract new customers, (ii) more likely that customers will downgrade or disconnect their services and
(iii) more difficult for us to maintain ARPU at existing levels. The Netherlands may also seek new or increased
revenue sources due to fiscal deficits. Such actions may further adversely affect our company. Accordingly, our
ability to increase, or, in certain cases, maintain, our revenue, ARPUs, RGUs and OCF, as the case may be,
operating cash flow, operating cash flow margins and liquidity could be materially adversely affected if the
economic environment in Europe remains uncertain or declines (including as a result of the U.K.’s vote to leave
the European Union). We are currently unable to predict the extent of any of these potential adverse effects. For a
description of the risks associated with the U.K.’s vote to leave the European Union, see “—The U.K.
_referendum advising for the exit of the U.K. from the E.U. could have a material adverse effect on our business,_
_financial condition or results of operations.”_

**_Changes in technology may limit the competitiveness of and demand for our products and services._**

Technology in the video, telecommunications and data services industries is changing rapidly, including
advances in current technologies and the emergence of new technologies. New technologies, products and
services may impact customer behavior and therefore demand for our products and services. The ability to
anticipate changes in technology and consumer tastes and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products
on a timely basis will affect our ability to continue to grow, increase our revenue and number of subscribers and
remain competitive. New products and services, once marketed, may not meet consumer expectations or demand,
can be subject to delays in development and may fail to operate as intended. A lack of market acceptance of new
products and services that we may offer, or the development of significant competitive products or services by
others, could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and operating cash flow.

**_We depend almost exclusively on our relationships with third-party programming providers and broadcasters_**
**_for programming content, and a failure to acquire a wide selection of popular programming on acceptable_**
**_terms could adversely affect our business._**

The success of our video subscription business depends, in large part, on our ability to provide a wide
selection of popular programming to our subscribers. We generally do not produce our own content and we
depend on our agreements, relationships and cooperation with public and private broadcasters and collective
rights associations to obtain such content. If we fail to obtain a diverse array of popular programming for our pay
television services, including a sufficient selection of high-definition channels, out-of-home rights and non-linear
content (such as video-on-demand, Replay TV and digital video recorder capability), on satisfactory terms, we
may not be able to offer a compelling video product to our customers at a price they are willing to pay.
Additionally, we are frequently negotiating and renegotiating programming agreements and our annual costs for
programming can vary. There can be no assurance that we will be able to renegotiate or renew the terms of our
programming agreements on acceptable terms or at all. We expect that programming and copyright costs will
continue to rise in future periods as a result of, among other factors, higher costs associated with the expansion of
our digital video content, including rights associated with ancillary product offerings and rights that provide for
the broadcast of live sporting events, and retransmission or copyright fees payable to public broadcasters.

If we are unable to obtain or retain attractively priced competitive content, demand for our existing and
future television services could decrease, thereby limiting our ability to attract new customers, maintain existing
customers and/or migrate customers from lower tier programming to higher tier programming, thereby inhibiting
our ability to execute our business plans. Furthermore, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage if certain
of our competitors obtain exclusive programming rights, particularly with respect to popular sports and movie
programming. In addition, “must carry” requirements may consume channel capacity otherwise available for
more attractive programming.

**_We depend on third-party suppliers and licensors to supply necessary equipment, software and certain services_**
**_required for our businesses._**

We rely on third-party vendors for the equipment, software and services that we require in order to provide
services to our customers. Our suppliers often conduct business worldwide and their ability to meet our needs is
subject to various risks, including political and economic instability, natural calamities, interruptions in
transportation systems, terrorism and labor issues. In addition, further to geopolitical developments and security
threats suppliers may be subject to investigations, possibly leading to restrictions in the use of their products. As
a result, we may not be able to obtain the equipment, software and services required for our businesses on a
timely basis or on satisfactory terms. Any shortfall in customer premises equipment could lead to delays in
connecting customers to our services, and accordingly, could adversely impact our ability to maintain or increase
our RGUs, revenue and cash flows. Also, if demand exceeds the suppliers’ and licensors’ capacity or if they
experience financial difficulties, the ability of our businesses to provide some services may be materially
adversely affected, which in turn could affect our businesses’ ability to attract and retain customers. Although we
actively monitor the creditworthiness of our key third-party suppliers and licensors, the financial failure of a key
third-party supplier or licensor could disrupt our operations and have an adverse impact on our revenue and cash
flows. Additionally, we rely upon intellectual property that is owned or licensed by us to use various
technologies, conduct our operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges could be made against
our use of our or our licensed intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, patents and trade secrets) and we
may be required to enter into licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, incur monetary damages or be
enjoined from use of the intellectual property rights in question. Furthermore, VodafoneZiggo is partially
dependent on KPN for the supply of fiber lines to provide fixed network services to its enterprise customers.
KPN’s wholesale fiber services to businesses (“Fiber to the Office” or “FttO”) are no longer regulated by the
ACM.

**_Failure in our technology or telecommunications systems or leakage of sensitive customer data could_**
**_significantly disrupt our operations, which could reduce our customer base and result in lost revenue._**

Our success depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information
technology and network systems, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and other
hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, as well as our customer service centers. Some of
these are managed, hosted, provided or used by third-party service providers or their vendors, to assist in
conducting our business. In addition, the hardware supporting a large number of critical systems for our cable
network in a particular country or geographic region is housed in a relatively small number of locations. Our and
our third-party service providers’ systems and equipment (including our routers and set-top boxes) are vulnerable
to damage or security breach from a variety of sources, including telecommunications failures, power loss,
malicious human acts, security flaws, and natural disasters. Moreover, despite security measures, our and our
third-party service providers’ servers, systems and equipment are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic
break-ins, computer viruses, worms, phishing attacks and similar disruptive actions. We and our third party
service providers may not be able to anticipate or respond in an adequate and timely manner to attempts to obtain
authorized access to, disable or degrade our or our third party service providers’ systems because the techniques
for doing so change frequently, are increasingly complex and sophisticated and are difficult to detect for periods
of time. In addition, the security measures and procedures we and our third-party service providers have in place
to protect sensitive consumer data and other information may not be sufficient to counter all data security
breaches, cyber-attacks, or system failures. In some cases, mitigation efforts may depend on third parties who
may not deliver products or services that meet the required contractual standards or whose hardware, software or
network services may be subject to error, defect, delay, or outage.

Furthermore, our operating activities could be subject to risks caused by misappropriation, misuse, leakage,
falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems and
networks and those of our third-party vendors, including customer, personnel and vendor data. As a result of the
increasing awareness concerning the importance of safeguarding personal information, the potential misuse of
such information and legislation that has been adopted or is being considered across all of our markets regarding
the protection, privacy and security of personal information, information-related risks are increasing, particularly
for businesses like ours that handle a large amount of personal customer data. Failure to comply with these data
protection laws may result in, among other consequences, fines, litigation or regulatory actions.

Despite the precautions we have taken, unanticipated problems affecting our systems could cause business
disruptions such as failures in our information technology systems, disruption in the transmission of signals over
our networks or similar problems. Further, although we devote significant resources to our cybersecurity

69


-----

programs and have implemented security measures to protect our systems and data, and to prevent, detect and
respond to data security incidents, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent these threats. Any
disruptive situation that causes loss, misappropriation, misuse or leakage of data could damage our reputation
and the credibility of our operations, and could subject us to potential liability, including litigation or other legal
actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by our
insurance policies. Further, sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to provide service to
our customers or otherwise meet our business obligations in a timely manner could adversely affect our
reputation and result in a loss of customers and an adverse impact on revenue. Also, a cybersecurity breach could
require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems associated with the breach and to
expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to protect personal
information against cyber-attacks and other wrongful attempts to access such information, which could result in a
disruption of our operations

**_Unauthorized access to our network resulting in piracy could result in a loss of revenue._**

We rely on the integrity of our technology to ensure that our services are provided only to identifiable
paying customers. Increasingly sophisticated means of illicit piracy of television, broadband and telephony
services are continually being developed in response to evolving technologies. Furthermore, billing and revenue
generation for our pay television services rely on the proper functioning of our encryption systems. While we
continue to invest in measures to manage unauthorized access to our networks, any such unauthorized access to
our cable television service could result in a loss of revenue, and any failure to respond to security breaches could
raise concerns under our agreements with content providers, all of which could have a material adverse effect on
our business and results of operations.

**_Strikes, work stoppages and other industrial actions could disrupt our operations or make it more costly to_**
**_operate our businesses_**

We are exposed to the risk of strikes, work stoppages and other industrial actions. In the future we may
experience lengthy consultations with labor unions and works councils or strikes, work stoppages or other
industrial actions. The Group’s collective labor agreement entered into force as of 1 July 2018 and expired on
31 July 2019. As of the date of this Offering Circular, a new collective labor agreement has not yet been put in
place. However, under Dutch law, the Group’s collective labor agreement will have continued effect until a new
collective labor agreement has been agreed upon with the unions. Strikes and other industrial actions, as well as
the negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements or salary increases in the future, could disrupt our
operations and make it more costly to operate our facilities. In addition, strikes called by employees of any of our
key providers of materials or services could result in interruptions in the performance of our services. The
occurrence of any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_Our revenue has declined in recent periods and no assurance can be given that further declines will not occur_**
**_in future periods._**

Due in large part to the impacts of strong competition, VodafoneZiggo’s revenue has declined by 2.0% from
€3,974.5 million during the fiscal year ended 31 December 2017 (on a pro forma basis to give effect to the
adoption of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers) to €3,895.4 million during the fiscal year
ended 31 December 2018 and by 3.6% from €4,146.6 million during the fiscal year ended 31 December 2016
(after giving pro forma effect to the consummation of the JV Transaction) to €3,995.3 million during the fiscal
year ended 31 December 2017. To the extent that revenue declines occur in future periods, VodafoneZiggo will
be challenged to reduce costs to offset any such revenue declines in order to maintain or grow OCF or adjusted
EBITDA, as applicable. To the extent that revenue declines are not fully offset with synergies or other cost
savings measures, Covenant EBITDA of VodafoneZiggo would decline, potentially resulting in a reduction of
the borrowing capacity and, accordingly, financial flexibility. For additional information, see “Selected
_Consolidated Financial and Operating Data of VodafoneZiggo” herein and “Management’s Discussion and_
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the 2019 Financial Statements and the 2018_
Annual Report.

**_We may not be successful at entering new businesses or broadening the scope of our existing product and_**
**_service offerings._**

From time to time we may enter or have recently entered into new businesses that are adjacent or
complementary to our existing businesses and that broaden the scope of our existing product and service

70


-----

offerings. We may not achieve our expected growth if we are not successful in these efforts. In addition, entering
into new businesses and broadening the scope of our existing product and service offerings may require
significant upfront expenditures that we may not be able to recoup in the future. These efforts may also divert
management’s attention and expose us to new risks and regulations, which may have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Changes in value-added or similar revenue based tax rates could adversely affect our cash flows._**

Most of our revenue is derived from the Netherlands, which administer value-added or similar revenuebased taxes. Any increases in these taxes could have an adverse impact on our ability to maintain or increase our
revenue to the extent that we are unable to pass such tax increases on to our customers. In the case of revenuebased taxes for which we are the ultimate taxpayer, we will also experience increases in our operating expenses
and corresponding declines in our operating cash flow and operating cash flow margin to the extent of any such
tax increases. Any future increases in value-added tax rates or similar revenue based taxes could affect our
operating expenses and have an adverse impact on our cash flows.

**_Adverse decisions of tax authorities or changes in tax treaties, laws, rules or interpretations could have a_**
**_material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow._**

The tax laws and regulations in the Netherlands may be subject to change and there may be changes in
interpretation and enforcement of tax law. As a result, we may face increases in taxes payable if tax rates
increase, or if tax laws and regulations are modified by the competent authorities in an adverse manner. In
addition, the tax authorities in the Netherlands may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take
regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions, including the tax treatment or
characterization of our indebtedness, including the Notes, existing and future intercompany loans and guarantees
or the deduction of interest expenses. As a result, we may face increases in taxes payable if tax rates increase, or
if tax laws and regulations are modified by the competent authorities in an adverse manner.

Further, the withholding tax treatment of interest paid to lenders based in the U.K. under any present or
future loan could be negatively affected as a result of Brexit. See “—The U.K. referendum advising for the exit of
_the U.K. from the E.U. could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of_
_operations.”_

We regularly assess the likelihood of such outcomes and have established tax allowances which represent
management’s best estimate of the potential assessments. The resolution of any of these tax matters could differ
from the amount reserved, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, business, financial
condition and results of operations for any affected reporting period.

**_We are exposed to sovereign debt and currency instability risks in Europe that could have an adverse impact_**
**_on our liquidity, financial condition and cash flows._**

Our operations are subject to macroeconomic and political risks that are outside of our control. For example,
high levels of sovereign debt in the U.S. and certain European countries combined with weak growth and high
unemployment, could lead to fiscal reforms (including austerity measures), sovereign debt restructurings,
currency instability, increased counterparty credit risk, high levels of volatility, and potentially, disruptions in the
credit and equity markets, as well as other outcomes that might adversely impact us. With regard to currency
instability issues, concerns exist in the Eurozone with respect to individual macro-fundamentals on a country-bycountry basis, as well as with respect to the overall stability of the European monetary union and the suitability of
a single currency to appropriately deal with specific fiscal management and sovereign debt issues in individual
Eurozone countries. Further, the United Kingdom held a referendum on 23 June 2016, to determine whether the
United Kingdom should leave the European Union or remain as a member state, and the outcome of that
referendum was in favor of leaving the European Union (“Brexit”). It is possible that members of the European
monetary union could hold a similar referendum regarding their membership within the Eurozone in the future.
The realization of these concerns could lead to the exit of one or more countries from the European monetary
union and the re-introduction of individual currencies in these countries, or, in more extreme circumstances, the
possible dissolution of the euro entirely, which could result in the redenomination of a portion, or in the extreme
case, all of our euro-denominated assets, liabilities and cash flows to the new currency of the country in which
they originated. This could result in a mismatch in the currencies of our assets, liabilities and cash flows. Any
such mismatch, together with the capital market disruption that would likely accompany any such
redenomination event, could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition.

71


-----

Furthermore, any redenomination event would likely be accompanied by significant economic dislocation,
particularly within the Eurozone countries, which in turn could have an adverse impact on demand for our
products, and accordingly, on our revenue and cash flows. Moreover, any changes from euro to non-euro
currencies in the Netherlands would require us to modify our billing and other financial systems. No assurance
can be given that any required modifications could be made within a timeframe that would allow us to timely bill
our customers or prepare and file required financial reports. In light of the significant exposure that we have to
the euro through our euro-denominated borrowings, derivative instruments, cash balances and cash flows, a
redenomination event could have a material adverse impact on us.

**_The U.K. referendum advising for the exit of the U.K. from the E.U. could have a material adverse effect on_**
**_our business, financial condition or results of operations._**

On 23 June 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved, on an advisory basis, an exit from
the E.U., commonly referred to as “Brexit”. Following the failure to reach a separation deal by the original
deadline of 29 March 2019, the E.U. granted the U.K. an extension until 31 October 2019. Uncertainty remains
as to what kind of separation agreement, if any, may be approved by the U.K. Parliament. It is possible that the
U.K. will again fail to reach a separation agreement with the E.U. by the new 31 October 2019 deadline which,
absent another extension, would require the U.K. to leave the E.U. under a so-called “hard Brexit” or “no-deal
Brexit” without agreements on trade, finance and other key elements. The foregoing has caused considerable
uncertainty.

Political parties in several other member states of the E.U. have proposed that a similar referendum be held
on their country’s membership in the E.U. It is unclear whether any other member states of the E.U. will hold
such referendums, but further disruption can be expected if there are.

Areas where the uncertainty created by the U.K.’s vote to withdraw from the E.U. is relevant include, but
are not limited to, trade within Europe, foreign direct investment in Europe, the scope and functioning of
European regulatory frameworks, industrial policy pursued within European countries, immigration policy
pursued within European Union countries, the regulation of the provision of financial services within and to
persons in Europe and trade policy within European countries and internationally.

It could also, among other outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the
U.K. and the E.U., undermine bilateral cooperation in key geographic areas and significantly disrupt trade
between the U.K. and the E.U. or other nations as the U.K. pursues independent trade relations. The initial impact
of the announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global capital markets, as well as significant
currency fluctuations.

The potential impacts, if any, of the uncertainty relating to Brexit or the resulting terms of the withdrawal of
the U.K. from the E.U. on customer behavior, economic conditions, interest rates, currency exchange rates,
availability of capital or other matters are unclear. Examples of the impact Brexit could have on our business,
financial condition or results of operations include:

    - changes in foreign currency exchange rates and disruptions in the capital markets. For further
discussion of risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and disruptions in the capital
markets, see “—We are exposed to sovereign debt and currency instability risks in Europe that could
_have an adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition and cash flows”;_

    - global economic uncertainty, which may cause our customers to reevaluate what they are willing to
spend on our products and services; and rules relating to data protection, consumer protection and ecommerce;

    - various geopolitical forces may impact the global economy and our business, including, for example,
other E.U. Member States proposing referendums to, or electing to, exit the E.U.

Any of these effects of Brexit, and others that we cannot anticipate, could adversely impact our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

**Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters**

**_We are subject to significant government regulation and supervision, which may increase our costs and_**
**_otherwise adversely affect our business, and further changes could also adversely affect our business._**

Video distribution, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony, mobile and content businesses are subject to
significant regulation and supervision by various regulatory bodies in the Netherlands, including Dutch and

72


-----

European Union authorities. Adverse regulatory developments could subject our businesses to a number of risks.
Regulation, including conditions imposed on us by competition or other authorities as a requirement to close
acquisitions or dispositions, could limit growth, revenue and the number and types of services offered and could
lead to increased operating costs and property and equipment additions. In addition, regulation may restrict our
operations and subject them to further competitive pressure, including pricing restrictions, interconnect and other
access obligations, and restrictions or controls on content, including content provided by third parties. Failure to
comply with current or future regulation could expose our businesses to various penalties.

The video distribution, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile businesses are regulated at the E.U.
level. In the Netherlands, these regulations are implemented through the Telecommunicatiewet (the Dutch
Telecommunications Act, “DTA”) and the Mediawet (the Dutch Media Act, “DMA”) and related legislation and
regulations. The Authority for Consumers and Markets (“ACM”, Autoriteit Consument & Markt), in which the former
Independent Post and Telecommunications Authority (Onafhankelijke Post en Telecommunicatie Autoriteit) has been
integrated, and the Dutch Radiocommunications Agency (Agentschap Telecom) supervise and enforce compliance
with certain parts of the DTA. Pursuant to the DTA, the ACM is designated as a National Regulatory Authority. The
Dutch Media Authority (Commissariaat voor de Media) is authorized to enforce compliance with the DMA.

Complying with existing regulations is burdensome, and future changes may increase our operational and
administrative expenses and limit our revenues, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. Recent regulatory developments include ACM rendering
its final decision on 28 September 2018 in its Local Loop Unbundling market analysis (currently referred to as
Wholesale Fixed Access (WFA)) in which it aims to impose inter alia an obligation on us to offer wholesale
cable access to competitors in the Netherlands. We have appealed ACM’s decision and we expect a verdict
before the end of 2019. The Dutch Government is also planning to (re-)auction mobile spectrum licenses in the
700, 1400 and 2100 MHz bands in early 2020, which is relevant for our ability to secure sufficient and required
spectrum for our mobile service offerings. The Dutch Government submitted a legislative proposal (Wet Melding
Ongewenste Zeggenschap Telecom, “WOZT”) to Parliament on 5 March. This proposal introduces measures for
the Minister to act against undesired control in the telecom sector and is aimed at protecting the public interest.
The implementation of the European Electronic Communications Code (“EECC”) will also amend the DTA and
will update and introduce regulation that will impact various aspects of our business, for instance spectrum
regulation, symmetrical access and end-users rights. This new telecom code will enter into force 21 December
2020. Regulatory requirements in relation to the markets in which we operate and other regulatory risks are
further described in the section entitled “Regulatory” in the 2018 Annual Report.

**Risks Relating to Our Management, Principal Shareholders and Related Parties**

**_The loss of certain key personnel could harm our business._**

We have experienced employees at both the corporate and operational levels who possess substantial
knowledge of our business and operations and are important to the success of our business. There can be no
assurance that we will be successful in retaining the services of these employees or that we would be successful
in hiring and training suitable replacements without undue costs or delays. As a result, the loss of any of these
key employees could cause significant disruptions to our integration efforts and our business operations
generally, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.

**_The interests of our indirect parent company or companies, as the case may be, may conflict with our interests_**
**_and this could adversely affect our business._**

Liberty Global and Vodafone International are our indirect parents (the “JV Parents”) owning, indirectly,
all of the voting interests in us. When business opportunities, or risks and risk allocation matters arise, the
interests of Liberty Global and the JV Parents may be different from, or in conflict with, our interests on a standalone basis. Our indirect parent companies may allocate certain or all of their risks to us. The ability of the
VodafoneZiggo to manage its own business and affairs is subject to certain veto rights of the JV Parents set out
in the shareholders’ agreement between the parties. There can be no assurance that the JV Parents will permit us
to pursue certain business opportunities, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

The JV Parents’ interests may differ from each other resulting in diverging business goals and strategies for
the joint venture. If disagreements develop among the JV Parents, this could result in a deadlock in decision
making and our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects may be harmed.
Joint ventures implicate additional risks, such as:

    - inability to take actions with respect to joint venture activities that are believed to be favourable to one
of the parties if the other party disagrees;

73


-----

    - business decisions or other actions or omissions of joint venture partners that may result in harm to
reputation or adversely affect the value of investments; and

    - actions of joint venture partners that could result in negative impacts on debt and equity.

These and other risks related to the joint venture could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The Issuer expects that the net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes, together with any upfront payments
payable by the New VFZ Facilities Borrower under the New VFZ Facilities Agreement, will be approximately
€400.0 million and will be used by the Issuer to finance the acquisition of VFZ Accounts Receivable pursuant to
the terms of the Framework Assignment Agreement or to fund the New VFZ Facilities Loans under the New
VFZ Facilities Agreement, as further described below.

To the extent that there are not sufficient VFZ Accounts Receivable available for purchase on the first Value
Date falling on or after the Issue Date, the Issuer will advance any excess proceeds from the issuance of the
Notes to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower as Excess Cash Loans under the Excess Cash Facility pursuant to the
New VFZ Facilities Agreement. It is expected that the Issuer will complete its initial purchases of new and
existing VFZ Accounts Receivable by 31 March 2020. On the Issue Date, the Issuer will also fund an Issue Date
Facility Loan in a principal amount equal to the Subscription Proceeds under the Issue Date Facility to the New
VFZ Facilities Borrower, pursuant to the New VFZ Facilities Agreement.

75


-----

**DESCRIPTION OF THE ISSUER**

**General**

The Issuer, VZ Vendor Financing B.V., is a limited liability company under Dutch law (besloten
_vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid), having its official seat in Amsterdam, the Netherlands and_
registered with the Dutch commercial register under number 76130592. The registered office of the Issuer is at
Herikerbergweg 238, Luna ArenA, 1101CM Amsterdam and its telephone number is +31 (0) 205755600.

The Issuer does not have an authorized share capital. The Issuer has issued 100 ordinary shares of €1 each
and will issue a number of ordinary shares equal to the Minimum Issuer Capitalization Amount (the “Issue Date
**Shares”, together with the Existing Shares, the “Shares”), if any, in connection with the offering of the Notes,**
which are and will be, respectively, fully paid up and held by the Foundation. The holder of the ordinary share

TMF Management B.V. (the “Managing Director”), a Dutch company, acts as the Managing Director for
the Issuer. The office of the Managing Director serves as the general business office of the Issuer. Through the
office and pursuant to the terms of the issuer management agreement entered into on or before the Issue Date (the

In consideration for the foregoing, the Managing Director receives various fees and other charges payable by the
Issuer at rates agreed upon from time to time plus expenses. The terms of the Issuer Management Agreement
provide that either party may terminate the Issuer Management Agreement upon the occurrence of certain stated
events, including any material breach by the other party of its obligations under the Issuer Management

was notified of such breach. In addition, either party may terminate the Issuer Management Agreement at any
time by giving not less than two months’ written notice to the other party. The termination of the Managing
Director becomes effective only upon the appointment by the Issuer of a successor managing director servicer.
The Issuer Management Agreement will contain standard limited recourse and non-petition provisions with
respect to the Issuer.

The Managing Director’s principal office is at Herikerbergweg 238, 1101 CM, Amsterdam, The

**DESCRIPTION OF THE RECEIVABLES**

_The following description includes a summary of certain provisions of the Discounted Payments Purchase_
_Agreements, the Accounts Payable Management Services Agreement and the Framework Assignment Agreement,_
_which does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the detailed provisions of each such_
_agreement._

**Overview: Creation of VFZ Accounts Receivable**

In the course of their business, VodafoneZiggo and its subsidiaries purchase goods and/or services from
suppliers pursuant to the terms of various supply contracts, and those suppliers issue invoices requiring the
relevant Buyer Entity to make payment for the purchase of such goods and/or services on the terms specified in
the applicable invoice and supply contract. Certain of VodafoneZiggo’s subsidiaries (the “Buyer Subsidiaries”)
may accede as buyer entities to the Accounts Payable Management Services Agreement (as defined elsewhere in
this Offering Circular and further described in “Summary of Principal Documents—Accounts Payable
_Management Services Agreement”), between, among others, VodafoneZiggo and the Platform Provider, pursuant_
to which the invoices owing by VodafoneZiggo and the Buyer Subsidiaries are factored or sold through the SCF
Platform, an online portal established and administered by the Platform Provider. Each Supplier (as defined
below) and the Platform Provider have entered into a Discounted Payments Purchase Agreement (as defined
elsewhere in this Offering Circular and further described in “Summary of Principal Documents—Discounted
_Payments Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which such Supplier will accept payment of invoices through the_
SCF Platform. Each invoice evidences an amount payable by a Buyer Entity to a Supplier as a result of an
existing business relationship, and includes all rights attaching thereto under the relevant contract to which such
invoice relates and the SCF Platform Documents (each a “Receivable” and collectively, the “Receivables”).

From time to time, a Buyer Entity may upload an Electronic Data File containing details of Receivables
(including, among other things, the amount, the invoice date and the currency) payable to a Supplier onto the
SCF Platform. The designation of such uploaded Receivables as “approved” by a Buyer Entity (an “Approved
**Platform Receivable”) will initially give rise to an independent and primary obligation owed by VodafoneZiggo**
to make payment (or cause payment to be made) to the Relevant Recipient on the Confirmed Payment Date in
respect of such Approved Platform Receivable (a “Parent Payment Obligation”). As permitted in accordance
with the terms pursuant to which the relevant assets were acquired and/or services supplied, the relevant Buyer
Entity will specify, in such Electronic Data File, the date on which such Parent Payment Obligation and the
related Receivable will be paid (which date will be either the payment due date indicated on the original invoice
or a date up to 360 days from the payment due date indicated on the original invoice date, each a “Confirmed
**Payment Date”).**

As part of its participation in the SCF Platform, each Supplier has agreed that it will offer to sell Parent
Payment Obligations and the related Receivables to the Platform Provider. In such cases, the Platform Provider may
purchase the relevant Parent Payment Obligation and such related Receivable from the Supplier at a price intended
to be equal to the original face value of the invoice owed to the Supplier (as further described under “Summary of
_Principal Documents—Discounted Payments Purchase Agreements”). Following such sale and assignment of a_
Parent Payment Obligation and the related Receivable from the Supplier to the Platform Provider through the
Platform, a new independent and primary, irrevocable, legal, valid and binding payment obligation of each Obligor
(on a joint and several basis) will arise to pay the Relevant Recipient on the Confirmed Payment Date.

Each Obligor will become jointly and severally liable with each other Obligor to make payment or cause
payment to be made to the Relevant Recipient on the Confirmed Payment Date in respect of such Parent Payment
Obligation (such Parent Payment Obligation, as enhanced by the joint and several payment undertaking of each
Obligor, a “Payment Obligation”). Pursuant to the Framework Assignment Agreement (as defined below), the
Platform Provider may subsequently offer to sell and assign to the Issuer, on a non-recourse basis, eligible
Payment Obligations and the related Receivables (solely to the extent that such Receivables have been acquired
by the Platform Provider) (collectively and as further described and defined below, the “VFZ Accounts
**Receivable”).**

**Sale and Assignment of the Receivables from the Suppliers to the Platform Provider: the Discounted**
**Payments Purchase Agreement**

In conjunction with the SCF Platform, each Supplier has entered into, or will enter into, a Discounted
Payments Purchase Agreement (each based on a standard form) with the Platform Provider. Upon an Upload by a

79


-----

Buyer Entity and the designation of such uploaded Receivable as “approved”, (i) the price of such Receivable is
increased (in accordance with the relevant supply contract, including any supplement thereto) by adding to the
initial face value of such Receivable the Applied Discount (as defined in the context of the APMSA) (as
displayed on the SCF Platform on the relevant day) calculated for the period between the date of the Upload and
the Confirmed Payment Date; and (ii) the Supplier to which such Approved Platform Receivable relates will
automatically and irrevocably offer to sell to the Platform Provider the relevant Parent Payment Obligation and
the Receivable related thereto at a discounted price (the “Net Purchase Amount”) (as determined by deducting
from the grossed-up amount of the relevant invoice (calculated in accordance with the relevant supply contract,
including any supplement thereto, as described above), such Applied Discount (as defined in the context of the
APMSA) (as displayed on the SCF Platform on the relevant day), such that the Platform Provider pays an amount
equal to the original face value of such invoice owed to the Supplier). Upon making such irrevocable offer, the
Supplier agrees not to sell, offer to sell, transfer, pledge or offer as security to any other person, or consent to any
other lien on, any Receivable that relates to the relevant Parent Payment Obligation. The Platform Provider may,
at its sole discretion, elect to either accept or decline to purchase the relevant Parent Payment Obligation and the
Receivable related thereto by posting such acceptance or rejection on the SCF Platform in accordance with the
terms of the relevant Discounted Payments Purchase Agreement. If the Platform Provider accepts such offer, it
shall cause the Net Purchase Amount to be paid to the relevant Supplier bank account on either the same
Business Day (if the acceptance takes place before 11:30AM CET) or the following Business Day (if the
acceptance takes place after 11:30AM CET). Each such offer accepted by the Platform Provider pursuant to a
Discounted Payments Purchase Agreement will result in the sale, assignment and transfer to the Platform
Provider of all of such Supplier’s rights, title and interest in and to the relevant Parent Payment Obligation and
the Receivable related thereto, without any further action or documentation on the part of the Supplier, the
relevant Buyer Entity or the Platform Provider being required.

The Supplier is deemed to represent and warrant to the Platform Provider upon the date of each offer (and
the date of the relevant Initial Transfer) that, with respect to each Parent Payment Obligation (and any Receivable
related thereto, where applicable), among other things: (i) the Supplier (solely) holds the full legal and beneficial
right, title and interest in and to the relevant Parent Payment Obligation and the Receivable related thereto;
(ii) the Supplier is entitled to sell and transfer the relevant Parent Payment Obligation and the Receivable related
thereto to the Platform Provider pursuant to the terms of the relevant Discounted Payments Purchase Agreement,
and the relevant Parent Payment Obligation and the Receivable related thereto is transferred to the Platform
Provider following acceptance of the offer; (iii) no mortgage, charge, pledge, lien, other encumbrance or other
personal right or right in rem exists in relation to the relevant Parent Payment Obligation or Receivable related
thereto, and the relevant Parent Payment Obligation has not been transferred nor made subject to any mortgage,
charge, pledge, lien, or other encumbrance in advance; and (iv) the Parent Payment Obligation and the
Receivable related thereto is free of any adverse claims, including any lien, right of set-off, netting, abatement,
reduction, claim, defence or counterclaim. Following each Initial Transfer, the Platform Provider, in its capacity
as agent for the relevant Supplier, shall provide notice of such transfer to the Buyer Parent and the relevant Buyer
Subsidiary.

Additionally, pursuant to the relevant Discounted Payments Purchase Agreement, any tax applicable to the
transfer from the Supplier to the Platform Provider of a Parent Payment Obligation and any Receivable related
thereto shall be solely payable by that Supplier. The Supplier also represents and warrants that upon payment by
the Platform Provider of the outstanding amount owing under any Parent Payment Obligation to the relevant
bank account established in such Supplier’s own name on the Confirmed Payment Date, the applicable Parent
Payment Obligation shall be satisfied and the relevant Buyer Entity’s obligation to pay the Supplier for the
corresponding Receivable shall be extinguished in an amount equal to such amount paid.

Subject to the agreement of the relevant Suppliers to the standard form, each Discounted Payments Purchase
Agreement gives the Platform Provider the right, without the consent of or notice to the Supplier, to assign,
transfer, mortgage, charge or otherwise deal in any other manner with any or all of its rights and obligations
under the relevant Discounted Payments Purchase Agreement, in whole or in part (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any of the Parent Payment Obligations and Receivables related thereto purchased by the Platform Provider
thereunder). In turn, pursuant to the Framework Assignment Agreement (as described above), the Platform
Provider’s right, title and interest in and to the whole of each VFZ Account Receivable are assigned to the Issuer.
For a further description of the Discounted Payments Purchase Agreements, see “Summary of Principal
_Documents—Discounted Payments Purchase Agreements”._

**Uploading of Receivables onto the SCF Platform and Purchase by the Platform Provider: the Accounts**
**Payable Management Services Agreement**

On 23 February 2015, the Platform Provider and VodafoneZiggo, among others, entered into the Accounts
Payable Management Services Agreement, or the APMSA. Under the terms of the APMSA, the Obligors,
together with certain other subsidiaries of VodafoneZiggo that may accede to the APMSA from time to time as
further described below (collectively, the “Buyer Entities” and each a “Buyer Entity”), may upload Electronic
Data Files containing details of Receivables payable to a Supplier on to the SCF Platform to enable the purchase
by the Platform Provider of such Receivables (and the Parent Payment Obligations arising in respect thereof)
from the relevant Supplier.

On the Issue date, the eligible Buyer Entities will be Ziggo B.V., Ziggo Services B.V., Vodafone Libertel
B.V., UPC Nederland B.V. (collectively, the “Non-Obligor Buyer Subsidiaries” and each a “Non-Obligor
**Buyer Subsidiary”, together with the Obligor Subsidiaries, the “Buyer Subsidiaries” and each a “Buyer**
**Subsidiary”), the Obligor Subsidiaries, and the Buyer Parent. Additional Buyer Subsidiaries may accede to the**
APMSA by entering into an accession letter (substantially in form set out in the APMSA) with the Platform
Provider and the Buyer Parent, and an existing Buyer Subsidiary may cease to be a “Buyer Entity” for the
purposes of the APMSA if the Platform Provider or Buyer Parent provides written notice to such effect.
Additional Obligor Subsidiaries may become party to the APMSA either by acceding as a “Designated Buyer
Subsidiary” (provided they are specified as such in the relevant accession letter) or, with respect to an existing
Non-Obligor Buyer Subsidiary, if such Non-Obligor Buyer Subsidiary is specified in writing by the Buyer Parent
to be a “Designated Buyer Subsidiary” for purposes of the APMSA. Pursuant to the Agency and Account Bank
Agreement, the Buyer Parent will undertake to the Issuer that the Buyer Parent may notify the Platform Provider
of a resignation of an Obligor Subsidiary only if all Outstanding Amounts owed by such Obligor Subsidiary (as
principal obligor) in respect of its Assigned Receivables have been settled in accordance with the APMSA on or
prior to the date of its resignation, and the Buyer Parent will agree to promptly provide written notification of the
same to the Issuer (or the Administrator on its behalf).

From time to time, a Buyer Entity may execute an Upload and designate such uploaded Receivables as
“approved”. Each Approved Platform Receivable will initially give rise to a Parent Payment Obligation, being an
independent and primary obligation by VodafoneZiggo to make payment or cause payment of the Certified
Amount to be made to the relevant recipient on the Confirmed Payment Date in respect thereof. Each Buyer
Entity agrees that, immediately following such designation, the relevant Obligor shall pay the Certified Amount
in full (without any deduction or withholding) and no Buyer Entity shall be entitled to claim set-off or
counterclaim against any party in relation to the payment of the whole or part of such Certified Amount. Upon
each Initial Transfer (being the sale and assignment of a Parent Payment Obligation and the applicable
Receivable related thereto from the Supplier to the Platform Provider through the SCF Platform), the relevant
Parent Payment Obligation will become a Payment Obligation, pursuant to which each Obligor will become
jointly and severally liable with each other Obligor to make payment or cause payment to be made to the relevant
recipient on the Confirmed Payment Date in respect thereof. Each Obligor acknowledges that, upon such Initial
Transfer, it and each other Obligor shall be liable by itself and for each other Obligor to pay the Certified
Amount in full (without any deduction or withholding) and no Obligor shall be entitled to claim set-off or
counterclaim against any party in relation to the payment of the whole or part of such Certified Amount. The
Non-Obligor Buyer Subsidiaries will not be liable for any Payment Obligations.

The obligations of the Buyer Entities described above will not be affected by an act, omission, matter or
thing which, but for the relevant provisions of the Framework Assignment Agreement, would reduce, release or
prejudice any of such obligations, including: (a) any time, waiver or consent granted to, or composition with, any
Buyer Entity or other person; (b) the release of any Buyer Entity or other person under the terms of any
composition or arrangement with any creditor of any person (other than the relevant recipient of any Parent
Payment Obligation and the Receivable relating thereto); (c) any failure to realize the full value of any security;
(d) any incapacity or lack of power, authority or legal personality of a Buyer Entity or any other person; (e) any
amendment, novation, supplement or restatement (however fundamental) or replacement of the APMSA or any
other documents; (f) any unenforceability, illegality or invalidity or any obligation of any person under the
APMSA; or (g) any insolvency or similar proceedings. Each Buyer Entity also waives any right it may have of
first requiring the Platform Provider to proceed against or enforce any other rights or security or claim from any
person before claiming from them pursuant to the APMSA, regardless of any applicable law or provision to the
contrary. The Buyer Entities further agree to refrain from exercising any of the following rights which they may
have under the APMSA until all amounts which may be or become payable by a Buyer Entity in connection with
the APMSA have been irrevocably paid in full: (a) to be indemnified by any other Buyer Entity; (b) to claim

81


-----

contribution from any other guarantor of any Buyer Entity’s obligations under the APMSA; (c) to take the benefit
of any rights of the Platform Provider or a transferee under the APMSA in respect of the Buyer Entities; (d) to
bring legal or other proceedings for an order requiring any Buyer Entity to make any payment or perform any
other obligation in respect of which any Buyer Entity has given an undertaking or indemnity under the provisions
of the APMSA; (e) to exercise any right of set-off against any Buyer Entity; and/or (f) to claim or prove as a
creditor of any Buyer Entity in competition with the Platform Provider or a transferee.

The Buyer Parent has notified the Platform Provider in writing that Eligible Platform Receivables (as
defined and further described under “Summary of Principal Documents—Accounts Payable Management
_Services Agreement” included elsewhere in this Offering Circular) may include those with a Confirmed Payment_
Date of up to 360 days from the issuance date of the relevant invoice. In respect of Initial Transfers of such
Receivables, a margin of 2.20% per annum calculated on the basis of the relevant Outstanding Amounts (which
includes the Platform Provider Processing Fee) over the base rate (the “Margin”) shall be applied from the date
of the relevant Initial Transfer until the Confirmed Payment Date in respect of such Payment Obligation (and the
Receivable related thereto, solely to the extent that such Receivable has been acquired by the Platform Provider).
The base rate (being, in this case, Euribor with a floor of zero) is determined by the remaining tenor between the
date of the relevant transfer and the Confirmed Payment Date (i.e. between 1 and 30 days, 1 month base rate will
apply; between 31 and 60 days, 2 months base rate will apply). The applicable base rate plus the applicable
Margin are used to calculate the Applied Discount that the Platform Provider will deduct from the Certified
Amount in the case of transfer by the Platform Provider of the VFZ Account Receivable prior to the Confirmed
Payment Date, and accordingly is used in the calculation of the Purchase Price Amount for each VFZ Account
Receivable. The Margin under the APMSA may not be amended without the written consent of the Issuer, and
pursuant to the terms of the other Transaction Documents, the Issuer will agree to provide its written consent to
any amendment of the Margin (without being required to seek the consent of the Noteholders) so long as the
obligations of the New VFZ Facilities Borrower in favour of the Issuer under Clause 11.2 (“Facility Fees”) of the
New VFZ Facilities Agreement remain in full force and effect.

If a Buyer Entity wishes to reduce the amount of any Approved Platform Receivable for any reason
(including as a result of any lien, right of set-off, defence, claim, counterclaim, or other certain adverse claim), it
may post the amount to be deducted from such Approved Platform Receivable (each, a “Credit Note”) as an
entry in an Electronic Data File to the SCF Platform Website and such Credit Note will be allocated to the
corresponding Payment Obligation on the following Business Day. No Credit Notes may be allocated to a
Payment Obligation following the relevant Certified Amount Fixed Date; however, such Credit Note will be
allocated to a Payment Obligation which has not yet been transferred through the SCF Platform in accordance
with the terms of the APMSA. Additionally, each Buyer Entity agrees to be responsible for the accuracy of all
information submitted by them onto the SCF Platform Website in respect of VFZ Accounts Receivable and the
Buyer Parent agrees to comply with certain reporting requirements set out in the APMSA.

Under the APMSA, each Buyer Entity represents, warrants and covenants to the Platform Provider at the
date of an Upload resulting in any Payment Obligation arising and at the date of any transfer via the SCF
Platform of a Payment Obligation and the Receivable related thereto (solely to the extent that such Receivable
has been acquired by the Platform Provider) (including each Assignment Date), as applicable, among other
things: (i) that the Approved Platform Receivable relating to each Payment Obligation meets certain criteria
under the APMSA, including (but not limited to) having a Confirmed Payment Date of no more than 360 days
from the issuance date of the relevant invoice and being denominated in an agreed currency; (ii) that the
Approved Platform Receivable is not subject to any mortgage, charge, pledge, lien, other encumbrance or other
personal right or right in rem of any third party and has, to the best of the relevant Buyer Entity’s knowledge, not
been transferred or transferred in advance; (iii) that each Payment Obligation and the Receivable related thereto
(solely to the extent that such Receivable has been acquired by the Platform Provider) is free of any adverse
claims, including any lien, right of set-off, netting, abatement, reduction, claim, defence or counterclaim; (iv) that
each Payment Obligation and Receivable related thereto (solely to the extent that such Receivable has been
acquired by the Platform Provider) can be validly transferred in accordance with the terms of the APMSA; and
(v) that each Payment Obligation will be settled by an Obligor by the payment of the relevant Certified Amount
on the relevant Confirmed Payment Date without withholding, deduction or set-off.

**Assignment of the VFZ Accounts Receivable by the Platform Provider to the Issuer: the Framework**
**Assignment Agreement**

On or about the Issue Date, the Issuer, as purchaser, will enter into the Framework Assignment Agreement
with, among others, the Platform Provider, the Buyer Parent and The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch

82


-----

as administrator. Under the Framework Assignment Agreement, from time to time commencing on the Issue
Date, the Issuer may purchase and have assigned to it on a non-recourse basis, up to the total amount of
Committed Principal Proceeds, and the Platform Provider may sell and assign on a non-recourse basis, eligible
VFZ Accounts Receivable that are made available by Suppliers and uploaded by the Buyer Entities to the SCF
Platform.

Each VFZ Account Receivable to be purchased by the Issuer must meet, and the Buyer Parent will represent
and warrant (on behalf of itself and as agent for the Buyer Entities) on the date of each Assignment (each such
date, an “Assignment Date”) in accordance with the Framework Assignment Agreement, that such VFZ Account
Receivable meets, the following eligibility criteria: that such VFZ Account Receivable (i) (with respect to the
Payment Obligation component of such VFZ Account Receivable only) is owed by the Obligors on a joint and
several basis; (ii) (with respect to the Payment Obligation component of such VFZ Account Receivable only) is
governed by English law; (iii) is denominated in euro; (iv) (with respect to the Payment Obligation component of
such VFZ Account Receivable only) is the legal, valid and binding obligation of each Obligor; (v) is capable of
being freely and validly transferred in the manner provided by the Framework Assignment Agreement, so that on
purchase the Issuer will receive good title; (vi) is due and payable in full without any right of set-off,
counterclaim or deduction in favour of the Buyer Entities; and (vii) has a maturity date that is no later than two
Business Days prior to the Maturity Date of the Notes. Additionally, immediately prior to each Assignment Date,
the Platform Provider will represent and warrant that it is entitled to assign the relevant Payment Obligation
pursuant to the terms of the Framework Assignment Agreement, and that it has not assigned, transferred or
otherwise disposed of, or created any encumbrance or security interest over, such Payment Obligation.
Furthermore, the Platform Provider will undertake that it will not, without the consent of the Issuer, take any
action that would adversely affect a Payment Obligation or the Issuer’s interest(s) therein (as further described in
“Summary of Principal Documents—Framework Assignment Agreement” included elsewhere in this Offering
Circular).

Each Payment Obligation will be the joint and several obligation of VodafoneZiggo and each of the Obligor
Subsidiaries. On the Issue Date, the eligible Obligor Subsidiaries will be VZ Financing I B.V. and VZ Financing
II B.V. (each, an “Obligor Subsidiary” and collectively, the “Obligor Subsidiaries”, together with the Buyer
Parent, the “Obligors”).

**_Purchases of VFZ Accounts Receivable with Requested Purchase Price Amounts_**

On or following the Issue Date (as further described in “Description of VodafoneZiggo—Capitalization of
_VodafoneZiggo” included elsewhere in this Offering Circular), the Platform Provider is expected to sell and_
assign to the Issuer VFZ Accounts Receivable for a Requested Purchase Price Amount of €400.0 million which
the Issuer will fund with all or a portion of the Committed Principal Proceeds. See “Use of Proceeds”. It is
expected that the Issuer will complete its initial purchases of new and existing VFZ Accounts Receivable by
31 March 2020. In connection with such sale and assignment, the Platform Provider will deliver to the Issuer:

1. an Assignment Framework Note to be accepted and agreed to by the Issuer, pursuant to which the
Issuer will agree, among other things, to purchase Payment Obligations (and the Receivables related
thereto, solely to the extent that such Receivables have been acquired by the Platform Provider), in
whole but not in part, at the relevant Purchase Price Amounts in an aggregate amount equal to a limit
(in respect of purchased Payment Obligations which have not been settled) specified therein (the
“Purchase Limit”); and

2. one or more Assignment Notices instructing the Issuer to pay to the Platform Provider, as consideration
for the sale and assignment of the relevant VFZ Accounts Receivable, a requested amount (a
“Requested Purchase Price Amount”) on the date falling five Business Days following receipt by the
Issuer of such Assignment Notice (a “Value Date”).

As used herein, a “Purchase Price Amount” means, in relation to any VFZ Account Receivable, an amount
equal to the Outstanding Amount (as defined below) of such VFZ Account Receivable less the Applied Discount
(as defined in the context of the APMSA) (as defined below) calculated as at the relevant Assignment Date.
“Outstanding Amount” means, with respect to a Payment Obligation, an amount equal to (i) the gross amount
of the Approved Platform Receivable in respect of which the Payment Obligation arose, less (ii) the sum of all
Credit Notes allocated to that Payment Obligation pursuant to the terms of the APMSA. “Applied Discount”
refers (i) in the context of the APMSA, to the discount amount that the Platform Provider will deduct from the
Certified Amount in case of a transfer of the Payment Obligation prior to the Confirmed Payment Date pursuant
to the terms of the APMSA and each relevant Discounted Payments Purchase Agreement and (ii) in the context

83


-----

of the Framework Assignment Agreement, to the discount amount that the Platform Provider will deduct from
the Certified Amount in the case of a transfer of the Payment Obligation prior to the Confirmed Payment Date
pursuant to the terms of the APMSA, and each relevant Discounted Payments Purchase Agreement, less the
Platform Provider Processing Fee.

From time to time following the Issue Date, the Platform Provider may, at its discretion (but not more than
once per week prior to the service of a notice of termination (as further described below)) and to the extent that
the Requested Purchase Price Amount specified in such Assignment Notice together with all other outstanding
Requested Purchase Price Amounts which have not been applied towards the purchase of VFZ Accounts
Receivable would not exceed €50.0 million at such time (the “Requested Purchase Price Amount Aggregate
**Limit”), serve further Assignment Notices (which may also be Primary Assignment Notices (as defined and**
further described below under “—Collections on Assigned Receivables and Further Purchases of VFZ Accounts
_Receivable with Collected Principal Amounts”)) to the Issuer pursuant to the relevant Assignment Framework_
Note.

Following the receipt of an Assignment Notice, so long as no Non-Compliance Event (as defined below) has
occurred and is continuing, the Issuer will pay, on the relevant Value Date, the relevant Requested Purchase Price
Amount (which may be adjusted as further described below) to the Platform Provider, which shall have the effect
of the Platform Provider immediately selling and assigning, without further action on the part of any person or
entity, all of its rights, title and interest in and to the relevant Payment Obligations (and the Receivables related
thereto, solely to the extent that such Receivables have been acquired by the Platform Provider) at the relevant
Purchase Price Amounts to the Issuer pursuant to the relevant Assignment Framework Note. The assignment of
any Payment Obligation (and the Receivable in respect of which such Payment Obligation has arisen, solely to
the extent that such Receivable has been acquired by the Platform Provider) from the Platform Provider to the
Issuer, (each pursuant to the Framework Assignment Agreement), is referred to herein as an “Assignment”.

The Requested Purchase Price Amount (and the corresponding VFZ Accounts Receivable) will be adjusted
if the aggregate of all Requested Purchase Price Amounts, together with (without double counting) the aggregate
of all Purchase Price Amounts in respect of outstanding Assigned Receivables would be higher than the relevant
Purchase Limit specified in that Assignment Framework Note. In such event, the Issuer must notify the Platform
Provider within two Business Days of receipt of the relevant Assignment Notice (i) of such circumstance and
(ii) that the Requested Purchase Price Amount will (A) be reduced to equal the amount which would cause the
aggregate Requested Purchase Price Amount, together with (without double counting) the aggregate of all
Purchase Price Amounts in respect of outstanding Assigned Receivables to equal such Purchase Limit and/or
(B) cancelled to the extent necessary such that the relevant assignment is for the whole, and not part, of the VFZ
Accounts Receivable.

The Issuer will not be obliged to pay a Requested Purchase Price Amount specified in an Assignment Notice
if any of the following events (each, a “Non-Compliance Event”) have occurred and is continuing (provided that
the Issuer notifies the Platform Provider, within two Business Days of the receipt of such Assignment Notice,
that one or more Non-Compliance Events have occurred and of the Issuer’s intention not to comply with such
Assignment Notice): (i) if the Framework Assignment Agreement or relevant Assignment Framework Note has
been terminated prior to the date of such Assignment Notice; (ii) if the terms and conditions of such Assignment
Notice materially deviate from the terms and conditions of the Framework Assignment Agreement or the
relevant Assignment Framework Note; (iii) if an Obligor Event of Default (as defined below) is continuing in
respect of any Obligor; and/or (iv) if a specified insolvency event occurs in respect of the Platform Provider
which directly results in the Platform Provider not continuing its business as contemplated under the Framework
Assignment Agreement. If, following the receipt of a Requested Purchase Price Amount on a Value Date, the
Platform Provider has acquired (or determines that it will on such Value Date acquire) insufficient VFZ Accounts
Receivable to apply the whole of the Requested Purchase Price Amount received on such Value Date, the
Platform Provider will either (i) serve, on such Value Date, one or more notices (substantially in the form set out
in the Framework Assignment Agreement, each, a “Purchase Price Return Notice”) to the Issuer and, on the
Business Day following the date of such Purchase Price Return Notice (a “Settlement Date”), pay to the Issuer
Collection Account, the excess Requested Purchase Price Amount not applied towards the purchase of VFZ
Accounts Receivable (such excess, the “Excess Requested Purchase Price Amount”); or (ii) retain such Excess
Requested Purchase Price Amount for a period of up to four Business Days following such Value Date (an
“Excess Retention Period”, and the final day thereof (which, at the Platform Provider’s discretion, may occur
prior to the fourth Business Day following such Value Date), the “Excess Retention Period End Date”) to be
applied towards the purchase of any VFZ Accounts Receivable arising during such Excess Retention Period. If
the Platform Provider chooses to retain such Excess Requested Purchase Price Amount, it further agrees that (i) if

84


-----

the Platform Provider acquires any VFZ Accounts Receivable during such Excess Retention Period, it will sell
and assign such VFZ Accounts Receivables to the Issuer (and the Platform Provider will be deemed to have
served an Assignment Notice in respect of such Assigned Receivables); and (ii) on the Business Day prior to the
Excess Retention Period End Date, the Platform Provider will serve a Purchase Price Return Notice in respect of
any remaining Excess Requested Purchase Price Amount to the Issuer, and subsequently pay such remaining
Excess Requested Purchase Price Amount to the Issuer Collection Account on such Excess Retention Period End
Date, together with all Excess Requested Purchase Price Interest (as defined below) due in respect thereof.
“Excess Requested Purchase Price Interest” shall accrue daily at the Funding Rate, calculated on any Excess
Requested Purchase Price Amount retained by the Platform Provider (and not applied towards the purchase of
VFZ Accounts Receivable), from (and including) the first day of the relevant Excess Retention Period to (and
including) the relevant Excess Retention Period End Date, or such later date on which the Issuer receives such
Excess Requested Purchase Price Amount together with all interest due in respect thereof. As used herein,
“Funding Rate” means a rate equal to the per annum margin specified in Clause 13.1 of the APMSA (less the
Platform Provider Processing Fee) over 1-month EURIBOR; provided that if 1-month EURIBOR is less than
zero, 1-month EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero.

Additionally, if on any Business Day the aggregate Requested Purchase Price Amounts held by the Platform
Provider (and not applied towards the purchase of VFZ Accounts Receivable) exceeds the Requested Purchase
Price Amount Aggregate Limit (such excess, an “Aggregate Amount Excess”), the Platform Provider will
immediately serve a Purchase Price Return Notice in respect of such Aggregate Amount Excess, and pay such
Aggregate Amount Excess to the Issuer Collection Account on the relevant Settlement Date. Any Aggregate
Amount Excess not returned to the Issuer by the relevant Settlement Date (such amount, a “Delayed Aggregate
**Amount”) shall accrue interest daily at the Funding Rate, calculated from (and including) such Settlement Date**
to (and including) such later date on which the Issuer receives the Delayed Aggregate Amount, together with all
interest due in respect thereof (the “Delayed Aggregate Amount Interest”).

**_Collections on Assigned Receivables and Further Purchases of VFZ Accounts Receivable with Collected_**
**_Principal Amounts_**

Prior to the service of an Obligor Enforcement Notification, the Platform Provider will act as collection
agent for the Issuer in respect of any Collected Amounts received or recovered relating to Assigned Receivables,
in accordance with the SCF Platform Documents. Except in circumstances where certain Collected Principal
Amounts are applied towards the purchase of new VFZ Accounts Receivable (as further described below), the
Platform Provider will apply any Collected Amount, within one Business Day of receipt or recovery thereof
(such scheduled date of application, a “Collected Amount Forwarding Date”), in or towards the repayment to
the Issuer of an amount equal to the Outstanding Amount of the relevant Assigned Receivables (to the extent that
such Assigned Receivables remain outstanding and has not been settled or otherwise paid to the Issuer).

From time to time, the Platform Provider may serve an Assignment Notice (a “Primary Assignment
**Notice”) which states that any Collected Principal Amounts in respect of Assigned Receivables relating to such**
Primary Assignment Notice are to be treated as further payments of Requested Purchase Price Amounts. So long
as (i) no Non-Compliance Event has occurred and is continuing (and in respect of which the Issuer has notified
the Platform Provider that the purchase mechanics described in this paragraph will not apply), (ii) the Requested
Purchase Price Amount Aggregate Limit will not be exceeded upon the deemed payment of the Requested
Purchase Price Amount in the New Assignment Notice (as defined below), upon receipt by the Platform Provider
of any Collected Amount on an Assigned Receivable relating to such Primary Assignment Notice, or (iii) no
notice of termination has been served (as further described below), then (a) the Platform Provider will be deemed
to have served an Assignment Notice on exactly the same terms as the Primary Assignment Notice, except for the
Requested Purchase Price Amount (which will be equal to the Collected Principal Amount that would otherwise
be due and payable to the Issuer) (such notice, the “New Assignment Notice”); and (b) the Platform Provider’s
obligation to pay such Collected Principal Amount to the Issuer will be set off against the Issuer’s obligation to
pay the Requested Purchase Price Amount under the New Assignment Notice. For the avoidance of doubt, the
purchase mechanics described in this paragraph will not affect the Platform Provider’s obligation to pay to the
Issuer any Premium on the relevant Collected Amount Forwarding Date. If, three Business Days following the
service of a New Assignment Notice, the Platform Provider still holds any Collected Amounts which have not
been utilised for the purchase of new VFZ Accounts Receivable (such amounts, “Unutilised Collected
**Amounts”), the Platform Provider will immediately serve a Purchase Price Return Notice to the Issuer in respect**
of such Unutilised Collected Amounts, and will pay such Unutilised Collected Amounts to the Issuer Collection
Account on the relevant Settlement Date. The Platform Provider will pay the Issuer interest on any “Retained
**Collected Amounts” (being any Collected Amount which has not been paid to the Issuer towards satisfaction of**

85


-----

the relevant Outstanding Amount and not been used to purchase further VFZ Accounts Receivable as described
above). Interest on Retained Collected Amounts shall accrue daily at the Funding Rate, calculated from (and
including) the relevant scheduled Collected Amount Forwarding Date to (and including) the relevant Settlement
Date or such later date on which the Issuer receives the Retained Collected Amount, together with all interest due
in respect thereof, as the case may be, and will be paid to the Issuer Collection Account on the relevant
Settlement Date or such later date, as applicable.

**Implementation of an Additional Online System: an SCF Platform Addition**

At any time, VodafoneZiggo and the Buyer Subsidiaries may, at their option, elect to participate in an
additional online system established and administered by another Platform Provider. In connection with any SCF
Platform Addition, VodafoneZiggo and the Buyer Subsidiaries may enter into additional accounts payable
management services agreements (or equivalent) and the Issuer may (and upon request by VodafoneZiggo, shall)
enter into one or more additional receivables assignment agreements (or equivalent), pursuant to which the Issuer
will purchase eligible VFZ Accounts Receivable from such additional Platform Provider. The consent of the
Noteholders will not be required for VodafoneZiggo, the Buyer Subsidiaries and the Issuer to give effect to any
SCF Platform Addition (including the modification of any Transaction Documents to implement such SCF
Platform Addition), and the Administrator will enter into any SCF Platform Addition Documentation if the
Administrator receives written confirmation from VodafoneZiggo (with a copy to the Notes Trustee) that, in
VodafoneZiggo’s determination, the entry into such SCF Platform Addition Documentation is reasonably
required to implement such SCF Platform Addition and does not materially and adversely affect the interests of
the Noteholders.

- After giving effect to any incurrence of indebtedness in connection with a Potential Financing Transaction
in compliance with the applicable covenants, including in connection with permitted refinancing debt,
permitted acquisition debt or other exceptions to the restriction on our ability to incur indebtedness, the
total debt and finance lease obligations and total capitalization presented above could increase, and such
increase could be material. See “Risk Factors–Risks Relating to Our Financial Profile–We may incur
_additional indebtedness prior to, or within a short time period following, the Issue Date of the Notes,_
_which indebtedness could increase our leverage and may have terms that are more or less favourable than_
_the terms of the Notes and our other existing indebtedness.”_
(1) The “As Adjusted - Financing Transactions” amount reflects the net impact of (i) an increase in cash
related to the proceeds received (a) from the issuance of the 2030 Senior Secured Notes, (b) associated
with the Additional Term Loan, net of an assumed aggregate original issue discount of €5.6 million, and
(c) associated with the Handset Securitization Facility, (ii) a decrease in cash related to (1) the prepayment
in full of Term Loan Facility F, (2) the 2020 Senior Secured Notes Redemption and the 2025 Senior
Secured Notes Redemption, including aggregate estimated redemption premium of €22.8 million, and
(3) the repayment in full of the 2024 Senior Notes, including estimated redemption premium of
€6.9 million, and (iii) a decrease in cash of €12.8 million associated with the upfront payment of estimated
aggregate fees and expenses in connection with the completion of the Financing Transactions.

87


-----

(2) The “As Adjusted - Refinancing Transactions and Transactions” amount reflects the Refinancing
Transactions and is further adjusted to reflect a decrease in cash of €5.0 million associated with the upfront
payment of fees and expenses in connection with the issuance of the Notes pursuant to the New VFZ
Facilities Agreement. For additional information, see “Use of Proceeds.”
(3) The “As Adjusted - Refinancing Transactions and Transactions” amounts assume the expected purchase of
available VFZ Accounts Receivables by the Issuer for an aggregate Purchase Price Amount of €400.0
million (“Initial Purchases”), comprising new and existing VFZ Accounts Receivable purchased directly
from the Platform Provider, between the Issue Date and 31 March 2020. Prior to the utilization of the
Committed Principal Proceeds to fund the Initial Purchases, the Issuer will advance any unutilized
Committed Principal Proceeds to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower, as the borrower under the New VFZ
Facilities Agreement, as Excess Cash Loans under the Excess Cash Facility pursuant to the New VFZ
Facilities Agreement. In that event, there would be an impact on total cash and cash equivalents, amounts
utilised under the New VFZ Facilities Loans, total third-party debt and total capitalization presented above.
Any actual impact would depend on the amount of VFZ Accounts Receivable made available to the Issuer
for purchase, and could be material.
(4) The amounts reflected exclude the undrawn Revolving Credit Facility, which remains fully undrawn. See
“Description of Other Indebtedness of VodafoneZiggo-Existing Credit Facility.” The “As Adjusted”
amounts reflect the impact of the Additional Term Loan and the prepayment in full of Term Loan Facility
F in connection with the Term Loan Refinancing.
(5) The “As Adjusted - Refinancing Transactions and Transactions” amount reflects the Refinancing
Transactions and is further adjusted to reflect the funding of an Issue Date Facility Loan equal to the
Subscription Proceeds under the Issue Date Facility.
(6) The “As Adjusted” amounts reflect the completion of the 2020 Senior Secured Notes Redemption and the
2025 Senior Secured Notes Redemption.
(7) The “As Adjusted” amounts reflect the repayment in full of the 2024 Senior Notes in connection with the
August 2019 Refinancing.
(8) These obligations are due within one year and accordingly are excluded from our indebtedness included in
our covenant calculations.
(9) The “As Adjusted” amounts reflect the Handset Securitization Facility.
(10) The “As Adjusted” amounts reflect the net impact of (i) the write off of €24.5 million of aggregate
unamortized premiums associated with the 2020 Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes,
Term Loan Facility F and the 2024 Senior Notes, (ii) €12.8 million of aggregate estimated deferred
financing costs assumed to be paid in connection with the issuance of the 2030 Senior Secured Notes, the
Additional Term Loan and the Handset Securitization Facility, (iii) the write off of €5.5 million of
aggregate deferred financing costs associated with the 2025 Senior Secured Notes and Term Loan Facility
F and (iv) the original issue discount of €5.6 million associated with the Additional Term Loan.
(11) In the event that additional indebtedness were incurred in connection with any Potential Financing
Transaction, there would be an expected impact on total cash and cash equivalents, total debt and capital
lease obligations, total owner’s equity and total capitalization presented above. Any actual impact would
depend on the amount of additional indebtedness incurred and the use of proceeds thereof, and could be
material. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—We may incur additional indebtedness prior to,
_or within a short time period following, the Issue Date of the Notes, which indebtedness could increase our_
_leverage and may have terms that are more or less favorable than the terms of the Notes and our other_
_existing indebtedness”._
(12) The “As Adjusted” amounts reflect (i) an aggregate €29.7 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to
the estimated redemption premiums to be paid in connection with the 2020 Senior Secured Notes
Redemption, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes Redemption and the redemption in full of the 2024 Senior
Notes, (ii) a gain on extinguishment of debt related to the write off of €24.5 million of aggregate
unamortized premiums associated with the 2020 Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes,
Term Loan Facility F and the 2024 Senior Notes, (iii) a loss on extinguishment of debt related to the write
off of €5.5 million of aggregate deferred financing costs associated with the 2025 Senior Secured Notes
and Term Loan Facility F and (iv) an assumed related income tax benefit of €2.7 million.

-----

makers to (i) determine how to allocate resources and (ii) evaluate the effectiveness of our management for
purposes of annual and other incentive compensation plans. As we use the term, OCF is defined as operating
income before depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, related-party fees and allocations,
provisions and provision releases related to significant litigation and impairment, restructuring and other
operating items. Other operating items include (a) gains and losses on the disposition of long-lived assets,
(b) third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions,
including legal, advisory and due diligence fees, as applicable, and (c) other acquisition-related items, such
as gains and losses on the settlement of contingent consideration. Our internal decision makers believe OCF
is a meaningful measure because it represents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance
that is unaffected by our capital structure and allows management to (1) readily view operating trends,
(2) perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between entities and (3) identify strategies to
improve operating performance. We believe our OCF measure is useful to investors because it is one of the
bases for comparing our performance with the performance of other companies in the same or similar
industries, although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other public
companies. OCF should be viewed as a measure of operating performance that is a supplement to, and not a
substitute for, operating income, net earnings or loss, cash flow from operating activities and other U.S.
GAAP measures of income or cash flows. A reconciliation of operating income to OCF is as follows:

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS OF VODAFONEZIGGO**

_The following contains a summary of the material provisions of the material indebtedness of_
_VodafoneZiggo. It does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference_
_to, the underlying documents. The following summary is, unless indicated otherwise, presented as of the date_
_hereof. Some of the capitalized terms used herein are defined in the applicable agreements and not all such_
_definitions have been included herein._

**Existing Credit Facility**

The Ziggo Borrowers (as defined below) have entered into the Existing Credit Facility (as defined below).
The terms of the Existing Credit Facility are summarized below, without giving effect to the Term Loan
Refinancing.

The Existing Credit Facility comprises (i) a $2,525.0 million term loan facility (“Term Loan Facility E”),
(ii) a €2,250 million term loan facility (“Term Loan Facility F” and, together with Term Loan Facility E, the
“Term Loan Facilities”) and (iii) a €800.0 million revolving loan facility (“Revolving Credit Facility” and
together with the Term Loan Facilities, the “Facilities”) which have been made available as additional facilities
pursuant to a senior facilities agreement originally dated 5 March 2015, between, among others, The Bank of
Nova Scotia as Facility Agent, Ziggo B.V. (the “EUR Borrower”) and Ziggo Financing Partnership (the “US
**Borrower”) as borrowers (the “Ziggo Borrowers”), certain lenders party thereto (the “Ziggo Lenders”) and**
ING Bank N.V. as Security Agent (the “Existing Credit Facility”). The Ziggo Lenders’ commitments may be
increased and additional facilities can be included under the Existing Credit Facility subject to certain conditions
and the consent of the Ziggo Lenders providing such increased commitment or additional facility.

Following the Ziggo Group Combination and the occurrence of the SPV Structure Termination as defined in
the agreement governing the Existing Credit Facility, the Term Loan Facilities and the rights, title, benefits,
interest and obligations thereunder were novated by Ziggo Secured Finance B.V., as original borrower under
Term Loan Facility F, and Ziggo Secured Finance Partnership, as original borrower under Term Loan Facility E,
to the EUR Borrower and the US Borrower, respectively. As a result of such novation, Ziggo Secured Finance
B.V. and Ziggo Secured Finance Partnership were released from their obligations under the Term Loan Facilities
on 8 March 2018 and such novation and release has been a deemed repayment in full and cancellation of the
relevant senior secured proceeds loans.

**_Structure_**

The Term Loan Facilities are bullet repayment loans that are subject to interest periods from time to time of,
at the relevant borrower’s election, one, two, three or six months (or any other period of up to 12 months as all
lenders under the relevant facility may agree with the borrower), but not beyond the final maturity date which,
for both Term Loan Facilities, is 15 April 2025. The Revolving Credit Facility can be repaid and redrawn at the
end of interest period up until one month prior to the final maturity date on 31 January 2026.

**_Conditions to Borrowings_**

Drawdowns under the Existing Credit Facility are subject to conditions precedent on the date the drawdown
is requested and on the drawdown date including (other than in connection with a Certain Funds Acquisition) the
following: (i) no default is continuing or would occur as a result of that drawdown and (ii) certain representations
and warranties specified in the Existing Credit Facility are true in all material respects.

**_Interest Rates and Fees_**

The interest rate in respect of the Facility E for each relevant interest period is equal to the aggregate of
(i) 2.50% per annum and (ii) LIBOR, subject to a LIBOR floor set at zero. The interest rate in respect of the
Facility F for each relevant interest period is equal to the aggregate of (i) 3.00% per annum and (ii) EURIBOR,
subject to a EURIBOR floor set at zero. The interest rate in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility for each
relevant interest period is equal to the aggregate of (i) 2.75% (“Revolving Credit Facility Margin”) and
(ii) EURIBOR and has a fee on unused commitments of 40% of such margin per year. The Revolving Credit
Facility Margin is subject to a margin ratchet which provides for margin to decrease under a step down to 2.50%
if either (x) Total Net Debt to Annualised EBITDA for the latest ratio period is less than or equal to 3.75:1 or
(y) if Senior Net Debt to Annualised EBITDA for the latest ratio period is less than or equal to 3.00:1 and the
ratio of Total Net Debt to Annualised EBITDA is less than or equal to 4.00:1.

92


-----

Interest on the Facilities accrues daily from and including the first day of an interest period and is payable
on the last day of each interest period (unless the interest period is longer than six months, in which case interest
is payable on the last day of each six-month period) and is calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days unless
market practice differs in the relevant interbank market for a currency.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

The Existing Credit Facility requires that members of the Bank Group which generate not less than 80% of
the pro forma EBITDA of the Bank Group (excluding the EBITDA attributable to any joint venture) in any
financial year, to guarantee the payment of all sums payable by the borrowers and the guarantors under the
Existing Credit Facility to the facility agent, the lenders and the other finance parties under the Existing Credit
Facility and the other finance documents specified therein and such members are required to grant security over
all or substantially all of their assets to secure the payment of all sums payable under the Existing Credit Facility
and the other finance documents specified therein, provided that following the redemption of the 2020 Senior
Secured Notes, the lenders have agreed that the only security that will remain in place is security over shares in
obligors (other than the Parent), subordinated shareholder loans to members of the Bank Group and the rights of
ABC B.V. in relation to loans to its subsidiaries. The Senior Secured guarantors have provided guarantees and
security in favour of the facility agent, the lenders and the other finance parties specified in the Existing Credit
Facility in respect of their obligations and liabilities under the Existing Credit Facility and the other finance
documents specified therein.

**_Mandatory Prepayment_**

Upon the occurrence of a change of control, if the Instructing Group so requires, the Facility Agent will
cancel the lenders’ commitments and declare each lender’s loans due and payable on not less than 30 Business
Days’ notice.

**_Financial Covenants_**

The Existing Credit Facility requires the Parent, in the event that on the last day of any Ratio Period, the
aggregate outstanding amount under any Revolving Facility (other than cash collateralised or undrawn
Documentary Credits) and any net indebtedness under an Ancillary Facility exceeds an amount to 33 [1]⁄3 per cent.
of the aggregate Revolving Facility Commitments and each Ancillary Facility Commitment (the “Financial
**Ratio Test Condition”), to procure that the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio shall not exceed the Maintenance**
Covenant Financial Ratio (a ratio level to be agreed between ABC B.V. and the Composite Revolving Facility
Instructing Group, being the Lenders under Maintenance Covenant Revolving Facilities whose available
commitments under the Maintenance Covenant Revolving Facilities exceed 50% of the total available
commitments under the Maintenance Covenant Revolving Facilities). The financial covenant described above is
for the benefit of Revolving Facility Lenders and a breach of the financial covenant will need to result in the
Composite Revolving Facility Instructing Group instructing the Facility Agent to accelerate the Maintenance
Covenant Revolving Facility Commitments in order for it to trigger an Event of Default for the other Lenders.
The Revolving Credit Facility is designated as a Maintenance Covenant Revolving Facility and the Maintenance
Covenant Financial Ratio for the purpose of the Existing Credit Facility is set at 4.75:1.

**_Representations and Warranties_**

The Existing Credit Facility contains certain representations and warranties usual for facilities of this type,
which are subject to exceptions and appropriate materiality qualifications.

**_Events of Default_**

The Existing Credit Facility contains certain customary events of default, including, without limitation, in
relation to misrepresentations and cross-default, the occurrence of which, subject to certain exceptions and
materiality qualifications, would allow the Facility Agent (on the instructions of the Instructing Group) to
(among other things) (i) cancel the total commitments, and/or (ii) declare that all or part of the outstanding loans
be payable on demand.

**_Undertakings_**

The Existing Credit Facility restricts the ability of the Ziggo Borrowers and certain other Bank Group
entities which have acceded to the Existing Credit Facility as Guarantors from, among other things, undertaking

93


-----

certain action including incurring indebtedness, paying dividends, making distributions, creating security
interests in assets, disposing of assets and merging or transferring assets, in each case, subject to limited
exceptions and qualifications.

The Existing Credit Facility also requires the Ziggo Borrowers and the members of the Bank Group which
are Guarantors thereunder, to observe certain affirmative undertakings, which are subject to materiality and other
customary and agreed exceptions. These affirmative undertakings, include, but are not limited to, undertakings
related to (i) authorisations; (ii) notification of default (iii) compliance with laws; (iv) pari passu ranking; (v) not
amending constitutional documents; and, in relation to members of the Bank Group only, (vi) the maintenance of
insurance; (vii) not changing the nature of its business; (viii) payment of taxes; (ix) intellectual property and
(x) certain quarterly and annual financial reporting obligations including the delivery of compliance certificates
in relation to the testing of the financial covenant in the event that the Financial Ratio Test Condition is met.

Certain defined terms in this “—Existing Credit Facility” section have the following meanings:

“Bank Group” means ABC B.V., Vodafone Nederland Holding II B.V., any other Affiliate Covenant Party
and each Restricted Subsidiary (as defined therein).

“Instructing Group” means at any time Lenders (as defined therein) the aggregate of whose Available
Commitments (as defined therein) and participations in outstanding Advances (as defined therein) exceeds 50%.
of the aggregate Available Commitments and outstanding Advances of all of the Lenders, unless it is used in
relation to a single facility, in which case it means 50% of the aggregate Available Commitments and
“outstanding” Advances of all Lenders in relation to that facility.

A priority agreement dated 12 September 2006 and as amended and restated on 6 October 2006, 17
November 2006, 28 March 2013 and 14 November 2014 has been entered into by, among others, ABC B.V.
certain other members of the Bank Group (together with ABC B.V. and any other entity which accedes to the

available to certain lenders to the Issuer, among others, (and which was refinanced in full on or about the time of
the Ziggo Group Assumption).

**_General_**

The Group Priority Agreement sets out, among other things, the relative ranking of certain debt of the
Debtors, when payments can be made in respect of certain debt of the Debtors, when enforcement action can be
taken in respect of that debt, the terms pursuant to which certain of that debt will be subordinated upon the
occurrence of certain insolvency events and turnover provisions.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions, among others, that are contained in the Group
Priority Agreement. It does not restate the Group Priority Agreement in its entirety. As such, you are urged to
read the Group Priority Agreement.

**Debt”). The incurrence of Pari Passu Debt will be subject to compliance with, the Existing Credit Facility,**
Original Credit Facility, Senior Secured Notes finance documents, the Existing Credit Facility, and any other
_pari passu debt documents that already exist at that time (“Pari Passu Debt Documents”). A creditor of Pari_
Passu Debt shall be referred to in this section as a “Pari Passu Creditor”. The Existing Credit Facility liabilities

Secured Notes finance documents, the Original Credit Facility, the Existing Credit Facility and any other Pari
Passu Debt Documents). Such provisions, among other things, provide for customary restrictions and limitations
with respect to restrictions on payment, payment blockages, standstills on enforcement and the filing of claims.
Any loan of the proceeds of an issuance of Senior Unsecured Notes from a Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer to
ABC B.V. shall be referred to in this section as a “Proceeds Loan”. Please refer to the Group Priority Agreement
for a more detailed explanation of these and other provisions related to any Senior Unsecured Notes that may be

following order and are postponed and subordinated to any prior ranking liabilities as follows:

    - first, the liabilities of the lenders, issuing banks and ancillary lenders under the Original Credit Facility
(each a “Senior Lender” and such liabilities the “Senior Lender Liabilities”), amounts owing to the

_Priority of Security_

The security shall rank and secure the following liabilities (only to the extent that such security is expressed
to secure the relevant liabilities) in the following order:

    - the Senior Lender Liabilities, the Senior Agent Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities, the Senior Secured
Notes Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee Amounts, the Pari Passu Liabilities, the Pari Passu
Representative Amounts and certain other liabilities to the relevant agents and trustees, pari passu and
without any preference between them.

_Senior Unsecured Notes Enforcement Action_

Until the date the Senior Lender Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities
and the Pari Passu Liabilities have been discharged (the “Senior Secured Discharge Date”) the holders of the
Senior Unsecured Notes and/or the trustee of any Senior Unsecured Notes may not take any Enforcement Action
(as defined below), other than as expressly permitted by the Group Priority Agreement.

**_Restriction on Enforcement: Senior Lenders and Senior Secured Note Creditors and Pari Passu Creditors_**

The Group Priority Agreement provides that no Senior Lender, Pari Passu Creditor or Senior Secured Notes
creditor may take Enforcement Action in relation to the enforcement of transaction security without the prior
written consent of an Instructing Group (as defined below).

An “Instructing Group” means those creditors under the Original Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Notes
and the Pari Passu Debt Documents and those Hedge Counterparties whose senior secured credit participations at
any time aggregate more than 50% of the total senior secured credit participations at that time.

**_Restrictions Relating to Senior Unsecured Notes_**

_Restriction on Payment and Dealings_

The Group Priority Agreement provides that, until the Senior Secured Discharge Date, except with the prior

(i) pay, repay, prepay, redeem, acquire or defease any principal, interest or other amount on or in respect
of, or make any distribution in respect of, any Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities in cash or in kind or

(ii) exercise any set-off against any Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities, except as permitted by the
provisions set out in the caption “—Permitted Senior Unsecured Note Payments” below, the provisions
set out in the caption “—Restrictions on Senior Unsecured Notes Enforcement” below or the fourth
paragraph under the caption “—Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims” below; or

(iii) create or permit to subsist any security over any assets of any member of the Bank Group or give any
guarantee (and the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee may not, and no holder of Senior Unsecured Notes
may, accept the benefit of any such security or guarantee) from any member of the Bank Group for, or
in respect of, any Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities other than guarantees from those entities that are
guarantors under the Original Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Notes and the Pari Passu Debt (the
“Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantees”) which are subject to payment blockage, subordination and
turnover provisions substantially similar to those in the Group Priority Agreement.

_Permitted Senior Unsecured Note Payments_

Prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Debtors may make payments to the Senior Unsecured Notes
creditors in respect of the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities then due in accordance with the indenture in
respect of the Senior Unsecured Notes (the “Senior Unsecured Notes Indenture”) (such payments, collectively,
“Permitted Senior Unsecured Note Payments”):

(i) if:

(A) the payment is of:

(I) any of the principal amount of the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities which is permitted to
be paid by the Original Credit Facility and is not prohibited from being paid by the indenture

Passu Debt Documents pursuant to which any Pari Passu Debt is outstanding; or

(II) any other amount which is not an amount of principal or capitalised interest;

(B) no Senior Unsecured Notes payment stop notice is outstanding; and

(C) no payment default under the Original Credit Facility or the Senior Secured Notes or the Pari

occurred and is continuing;

(ii) if those lenders under the Original Credit Facility and those Hedge Counterparties whose senior credit
participations at any time aggregate more than 66 2/3 of the total senior credit participations at that
time (the “Majority Senior Creditors”), the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt
Representative give prior consent to that payment being made;

(iii) if the payment is of certain amounts due to the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee Amounts;

(iv) certain defined permitted administrative costs and note security costs payable by the Senior Unsecured
Notes Issuer;

(v) costs, commissions, taxes, consent fees and expenses incurred in respect of (or reasonably incidental

any twelve month period;

(vii) costs, commissions, taxes, premiums and any expenses incurred in respect of (or reasonably incidental
to) any refinancing of the Senior Unsecured Notes in compliance with the Group Priority Agreement
and the Original Credit Facility; or

(viii) the principal amount of the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities on or after the final maturity date of the
Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities (provided that, such maturity date is as contained in the relevant
Senior Unsecured Notes finance documents as originally entered into).

On or after the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Debtors may make payments to the Senior Unsecured
Notes creditors in respect of the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities in accordance with the Senior Unsecured
Notes finance documents.

_Payment Blockage Provisions_

Until the Senior Secured Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of the Senior Agent, the consent of
the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the consent of the representative of the Pari Passu Creditors (the “Pari
**Passu Debt Representative”), and subject to the provisions set out under the caption “—Effect of Insolvency**
_Event; Filing of Claims” below, ABC B.V. shall not make (and shall procure that its subsidiaries shall not), and_
neither the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee nor the holder of Senior Unsecured Notes may receive from ABC
B.V. or any of its subsidiaries, any Permitted Senior Unsecured Note Payment (other than certain amounts due to
the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee for its own account) if:

    - a Senior Secured Payment Default is continuing; or

    - an event of default under the Original Credit Facility or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or a Pari
Passu Debt Document (a “Senior Secured Event of Default”) (other than a Senior Secured Payment

100


-----

Default) is continuing, from the date of receipt by the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee of a stop notice
from the Senior Agent or the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or the Pari Passu Debt Representative (as
the case may be) specifying the event or circumstance in relation to that Senior Secured Event of
Default to ABC B.V., the Security Agent and the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee until the earliest of:

    - the date falling 179 days after receipt by the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee of that payment stop
notice;

    - in relation to payments of Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities, if a Senior Unsecured Notes standstill
period is in effect at any time after delivery of that payment stop notice, the date on which that
standstill period expires;

    - the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Event of Default has been remedied or waived in
accordance with the Original Credit Facility or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Pari Passu
Debt Documents (as applicable);

    - the date on which the Senior Agent or the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or the Pari Passu Debt
Representative (as applicable) delivers a notice to ABC B.V., the Security Agent and the Senior
Unsecured Notes Trustee cancelling the relevant payment stop notice;

    - the Senior Secured Discharge Date; and

    - the date on which the Security Agent or the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee takes Enforcement Action
permitted under the Group Priority Agreement against a Debtor.

Unless the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee waives this requirement, (i) a new Senior Unsecured Notes
payment stop notice may not be delivered unless and until 360 days have elapsed since the delivery of the
immediately prior Senior Unsecured Notes payment stop notice; and (ii) no Senior Unsecured Notes payment
stop notice may be delivered in reliance on a Senior Secured Event of Default more than 45 days after the date
the Senior Agent, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt Representative (as applicable)
received notice of that Senior Secured Event of Default.

The Senior Agent, the Pari Passu Debt Representative and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee may only serve
one Senior Unsecured Notes payment stop notice with respect to the same event or set of circumstances. Subject
to the immediately preceding paragraph, this shall not affect the right of the Senior Agent, the Pari Passu Debt
Representative or the Senior Secured Notes Trustee to issue a Senior Unsecured Notes payment stop notice in
respect of any other event or set of circumstances. No Senior Unsecured Notes payment stop notice may be
served by the Senior Agent, the Pari Passu Debt Representative or the Senior Secured Notes Trustee in respect of
a Senior Secured Event of Default which had been notified to the Senior Agent, the Pari Passu Debt
Representative or the Senior Secured Notes Trustee at the time at which an earlier Senior Unsecured Notes
payment stop notice was issued.

Any failure to make a payment due under a Senior Unsecured Notes Indenture as a result of the issue of a
Senior Unsecured Notes payment stop notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default shall not
prevent (i) the occurrence of an event of default (however defined in the Senior Unsecured Notes Indenture) as a
consequence of that failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Senior Unsecured Notes finance
documents; or (ii) the issue of a Senior Unsecured Notes enforcement notice on behalf of the Senior Unsecured
Notes creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

No Debtor shall be released from the liability to make any payment (including of default interest, which
shall continue to accrue) under any Senior Unsecured Notes finance document (including the Senior Unsecured
Notes Indenture) by the operation of the provisions set out under each section above under the caption “—
_Restrictions relating to Senior Unsecured Notes” even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any_
time by the terms of any of those provisions.

The accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with the Senior Unsecured Note finance
documents shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a Senior Unsecured Notes payment stop notice.

101


-----

_Restrictions on Amendments and Waivers_

Subject to the following paragraph, the Group Priority Agreement provides that the Senior Unsecured Notes
creditors may amend or waive the terms of the Senior Unsecured Notes finance documents (other than the Group
Priority Agreement or any security document) in accordance with their terms at any time.

Prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee may not amend or waive
the terms of the Senior Unsecured Notes where to do so would result in the Senior Unsecured Notes Finance
Documents not being in compliance with the terms of the Original Credit Facility:

(i) without the consent of the Majority Senior Creditors;

(ii) (where to do so would not be in compliance with the Pari Passu Debt Documents) without the consent
of the Pari Passu Debt Representative; and

(iii) (where to do so would not be in compliance with the Senior Secured Notes) without the consent of the
Senior Secured Notes Trustee.

_Restrictions on Senior Unsecured Notes Enforcement_

Until the Senior Secured Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing
Group, neither the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee nor any holders of Senior Unsecured Notes shall take or
require the taking of any Enforcement Action in relation to:

(i) the Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantees; and/or

(ii) any Proceeds Loan, except as permitted under the provisions set out under the caption “—Permitted
_Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantee and Proceeds Loan Enforcement” below, provided however, that_
no such action required by the Security Agent need be taken except to the extent the Security Agent
otherwise is entitled under the Group Priority Agreement to direct such action.

“Enforcement Action” is defined as:

    - in relation to any liabilities:

       - the acceleration of any liabilities or the making of any declaration that any liabilities are
prematurely due and payable (other than as a result of it becoming unlawful for a Senior Lender, a
holder of Senior Secured Notes, a holder of Pari Passu Debt or a holder of Senior Unsecured
Notes to perform its obligations under, or of any voluntary or mandatory prepayment arising
under, the debt documents);

       - the making of any declaration that any liabilities are payable on demand;

       - the making of a demand in relation to a liability that is payable on demand;

       - the making of any demand against any member of the Bank Group in relation to any guarantee
liabilities of that member of the Bank Group;

redemption or purchase of any liability but excluding any mandatory prepayments or mandatory
offers arising as a result of a change of control or asset sale (howsoever described) as set out in the
Original Credit Facility, Senior Secured Notes finance documents, Senior Unsecured Notes
finance documents or Pari Passu Debt Documents).

       - the exercise of any right of set-off, account combination or payment netting against any member
of the Bank Group in respect of any liabilities other than the exercise of any such right:

          - as close-out netting by a Hedge Counterparty or by a hedging ancillary lender;

          - as payment netting by a Hedge Counterparty or by a hedging ancillary lender;

          - as inter-hedging agreement netting by a Hedge Counterparty;

          - as inter-hedging ancillary document netting by a hedging ancillary lender (the rights
described in this and the preceding three bullet points of this paragraph, to be referred to as
“Permitted Netting”); and

102


-----

          - which is otherwise expressly permitted under the Original Credit Facility, the Pari Passu
Debt Documents, the Senior Secured Notes finance documents or the Senior Unsecured
Notes finance documents to the extent that the exercise of that right gives effect to a
permitted payment under the Group Priority Agreement; and

          - the suing for, commencing or joining of any legal or arbitration proceedings against any
member of the Bank Group to recover any liabilities;

    - the premature termination or close-out of any hedging transaction under any hedging agreement, save
to the extent permitted by the Group Priority Agreement;

    - the taking of any steps to enforce or require the enforcement of any security (including the
crystallization of any floating charge forming part of the security),

    - the entering into of any composition, compromise, assignment or similar arrangement with any
member of the Bank Group which owes any liabilities, or has given any security, guarantee or
indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of the liabilities (other than any actions permitted
under the Group Priority Agreement or any debt buy-backs pursuant to open market debt repurchases,
tender offers or exchange offers not undertaken as part of an announced restructuring or turnaround
plan or while a default was outstanding under the relevant finance documents); or

    - the petitioning, applying or voting for, or the taking of any steps (including the appointment of any
liquidator, receiver, administrator or similar officer) in relation to the winding up, dissolution,
administration or reorganization of any member of the Bank Group which owes any liabilities, or has
given any security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of any of the
liabilities, or any of such member of the Bank Group’s assets or any suspension of payments or
moratorium of any indebtedness of any such member of the Bank Group, or any analogous procedure
or step in any jurisdiction,

except that the following shall not constitute Enforcement Action:

    - the taking of any action falling within the seventh paragraph of the first bullet point above or the bullet
point immediately above which is necessary (but only to the extent necessary) to preserve the validity,
existence or priority of claims in respect of liabilities, including the registration of such claims before
any court or governmental authority and the bringing, supporting or joining of proceedings to prevent
any loss of the right to bring, support or join proceedings by reason of applicable limitation periods; or

    - a Primary Creditor, ancillary lender, Hedge Counterparty, issuing bank or the Senior Unsecured Note
Trustee bringing legal proceedings against any person solely for the purpose of (A) obtaining
injunctive relief (or any analogous remedy outside England and Wales) to restrain any actual or
putative breach of any debt document to which it is party; (B) obtaining specific performance (other
than specific performance of an obligation to make a payment) with no claim for damages;
(C) requesting judicial interpretation of any provision of any debt document to which it is party with no
claim for damages;

listing relations or common law fraud or to restrain any actual or putative breach of the Senior
Unsecured Note finance documents or the Senior Secured Finance Documents or for specific
performance with no claims for damages; or

    - allegation of material misstatements or omissions made in connection with the offering materials
relating to the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Unsecured Notes or in reports furnished to any of the
noteholders or trustees or any exchange on which the notes are listed pursuant to information and
reporting requirements under any of the notes finance documents (as applicable).

_Permitted Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantee and Proceeds Loan Enforcement_

The restrictions set out in the caption “—Restrictions on Senior Unsecured Notes Enforcement” above will
not apply in respect of the Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantee liabilities or any Proceeds Loan, if:

(i) an event of default (however defined in the Senior Unsecured Notes Indenture) (other than solely by
reason of a cross default (other than a cross default arising from a Senior Secured Payment Default)
arising from a Senior Secured Notes event of default) (the “Relevant Senior Unsecured Note
**Default”) is continuing;**

(iv) the Relevant Senior Unsecured Note Default is continuing at the end of the relevant Senior Unsecured
Note Standstill Period.

Additionally, the restrictions set out in the caption “—Restrictions on Senior Unsecured Notes Enforcement”
above will not apply in respect of the Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantee liabilities or any Proceeds Loan, if an
Insolvency Event (other than as a result of any action taken by any Senior Unsecured Notes finance party) has
occurred with respect to (i) a Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantor, in which case, Enforcement Action may be
taken against the Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantor subject to that Insolvency Event (only), or (ii) a Senior
Unsecured Notes Guarantor whose earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (calculated on an
unconsolidated basis but otherwise on the same basis as consolidated EBITDA) represent 10 per cent. or more of
consolidated EBITDA or whose gross assets (excluding intra-group items) represents 10 per cent. or more of the
gross assets of the Bank Group, in which case a Senior Unsecured Notes creditor may take Enforcement Action
against any member of the Bank Group).

Promptly upon becoming aware of an Event of Default (as defined in the Senior Unsecured Notes
Indenture) (a “Senior Unsecured Note Default”), the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee may by notice (a “Senior
**Unsecured Note Enforcement Notice”) in writing notify the Senior Agent, the Pari Passu Debt Representative**
and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee of the existence of such Senior Unsecured Note Default.

_Senior Unsecured Note Standstill Period_

In relation to a relevant Senior Unsecured Note Default, a “Senior Unsecured Note Standstill Period”
shall mean the period beginning on the date (the “Senior Unsecured Note Standstill Start Date”) the Senior
Agent, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt Representative receive a Senior Unsecured
Note Enforcement Notice from the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee in respect of a Senior Unsecured Note
Default and ending on the earlier to occur of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after the Senior Unsecured Note Standstill Start Date (the “Senior Unsecured
**Note Standstill Period”);**

Documents and the Hedge Counterparties (together the “Senior Secured Creditors”) take any
Enforcement Action in relation to a particular guarantor of the Senior Unsecured Notes (a “Senior
Unsecured Note Guarantor”), provided however, that:

(A) if a Senior Unsecured Note Standstill Period ends pursuant to this paragraph, the holders of the
Senior Unsecured Notes and Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee may only take the same
Enforcement Action in relation to the Senior Unsecured Note Guarantor as the Enforcement
Action taken by the Senior Secured Creditors against such Senior Unsecured Note Guarantor and
not against any other member of the Bank Group; and

(B) Enforcement Action for the purpose of this paragraph shall not include action taken to preserve or
protect any security as opposed to realise it;

(iii) the expiry of any other Senior Unsecured Note Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first
mentioned Senior Unsecured Note Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a result
of a cure, waiver or other permitted remedy);

(iv) the date on which the Senior Agent, Senior Secured Notes Trustee and Pari Passu Debt Representative
(to the extent prior to the relevant discharge date) give their consent to the termination of the relevant
Senior Unsecured Note Standstill Period; and

(v) a failure to pay the principal amount outstanding on the Senior Unsecured Notes at the final stated
maturity of the Senior Unsecured Notes.

_Subsequent Senior Unsecured Note Defaults_

The Senior Unsecured Note finance parties and the Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer, as applicable, may take
Enforcement Action under the provisions set out in the caption “—Permitted Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantee

104


-----

_and Proceeds Loan Enforcement” above in relation to a Senior Unsecured Note Default even if, at the end of any_
relevant Senior Unsecured Note Standstill Period or at any later time, a further Senior Unsecured Note Standstill
Period has begun as a result of any other Senior Unsecured Note Default.

**_Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims_**

The Group Priority Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to any
member of the Bank Group, any party entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of that member of the
Bank Group in respect of liabilities owed to that party shall, to the extent it is able to do so, direct the person
responsible for the distribution of the assets of that member of the Bank Group to pay that distribution to the
Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the secured parties have been paid in full. In this respect, the Security
Agent shall apply distributions paid to it in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “—
_Application of Proceeds” below._

Generally, to the extent that any member of Bank Group’s liabilities are discharged by way of set-off
(mandatory or otherwise) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to that member of the Bank
Group, any creditor which benefited from that set-off shall pay an amount equal to the amount of the liabilities
owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the
provisions set out in the caption “—Application of Proceeds” below. Certain exceptions apply to this obligation
including Permitted Netting (as defined under the caption “—Restrictions on Senior Unsecured Notes
_Enforcement”)._

If the Security Agent or any other secured party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in
respect of any of the liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent
that the realization proceeds are actually applied towards the liabilities.

After the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to any member of Bank Group, each creditor
irrevocably authorises the Security Agent, on its behalf, to:

(i) take any Enforcement Action (in accordance with the terms of the Group Priority Agreement) against
that member of the Bank Group;

(ii) demand, sue, prove and give receipt for any or all of that member of Bank Group’s liabilities;

(iii) collect and receive all distributions on, or on account of, any or all of that member of Bank Group’s
liabilities; and

(iv) file claims, take proceedings and do all other things the Security Agent considers reasonably necessary
to recover that member of the Bank Group’s liabilities.

Each creditor will (i) do all things that the Security Agent reasonably requests in order to give effect to the
matters disclosed under this section and (ii) if the Security Agent is not entitled to take any of the actions
contemplated by this section or if the Security Agent requests that a creditor take that action, undertake that
action itself in accordance with the instructions of the Security Agent or grant a power of attorney to the Security
Agent (on such terms as the Security Agent may reasonably require, although no trustee shall be under any
obligation to grant such powers of attorney) to enable the Security Agent to take such action.

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Group Priority Agreement provides that if any creditor receives or
recovers from any member of the Bank Group:

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities which is not
either (x) a payment permitted under the Group Priority Agreement or (y) made in accordance with the
provisions set out below under the caption “—Application of Proceeds”;

(ii) any amount by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it which does not give effect to
a payment permitted under the Group Priority Agreement;

(iii) any amount:

(A) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities:

(I) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of any security; or

105


-----

(II) as a result of any other litigation or proceedings against a member of the Bank Group (other
than after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that member of the Bank
Group); or

(B) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of an
acceleration event or the enforcement of any security,

other than, in each case, any amount received or recovered in accordance with the provisions set out
below under the caption “—Application of Proceeds”;

(iv) the proceeds of any enforcement of any security except in accordance with the provisions set out below
under the caption “—Application of Proceeds”; or

(v) any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities
owed by any member of the Bank Group which is not in accordance with the provisions set out below
under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” and which is made as a result of, or after, the
occurrence of an insolvency event in respect of that member of the Bank Group,

that creditor will: (i) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off
(x) hold an amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received or
recovered) on trust for the Security Agent and promptly pay that amount to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the terms of the Group Priority Agreement and (y) promptly pay an amount equal to the amount
(if any) by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the terms of the Group Priority Agreement; and (ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries
received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for
application in accordance with the terms of the Group Priority Agreement.

**_Enforcement of Security_**

_Enforcement Instructions_

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the security unless instructed otherwise by the Instructing
Group.

Subject to the security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms the Instructing Group may
give, or refrain from giving, instructions to the Security Agent to enforce, or refrain from enforcing, the security
as they see fit.

No secured party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to enforce, any security
or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the security documents except through the Security Agent.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the security is being enforced as set forth above under the caption “—Enforcement Instructions,” the
Security Agent shall enforce the security in such manner (including, without limitation, the selection of any
administrator of any Debtor to be appointed by the Security Agent) as the Instructing Group shall instruct or, in
the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit.

_Exercise of Voting Rights_

Each creditor agrees with the Security Agent that it will cast its vote in any proposal put to the vote by, or
under the supervision of, any judicial or supervisory authority in respect of any insolvency, pre-insolvency or
rehabilitation or similar proceedings relating to any member of the Bank Group as instructed by the Security
Agent. The Security Agent shall give instructions for the purposes of this paragraph as directed by an Instructing
Group; it being understood that, absent such instructions, the Security Agent may elect to take no action.

_Waiver of Rights_

To the extent permitted under applicable law and subject to certain provisions of the Group Priority
Agreement, each of the secured parties and the Debtors waives all rights it may otherwise have to require that the
security be enforced in any particular order or manner or at any particular time, or that any sum received or
recovered from any person, or by virtue of the enforcement of any of the security or of any other security interest,
which is capable of being applied in or towards discharge of any of the secured obligations, is so applied.

**_Proceeds of Disposals_**

_Distressed Disposals—General_

A “Distressed Disposal” is a disposal of an asset or shares of a member of the Bank Group which is
(a) being effected at the request of an Instructing Group in circumstances where the security has become
enforceable, (b) being effected by enforcement of the security or (c) being disposed of by a Debtor to a person or
persons which are not a member of the Bank Group subsequent to an acceleration event or the enforcement of
any security.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorised (at the
cost of the relevant Debtor or ABC B.V. and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation
from any creditor or Debtor):

(i) to release the security or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver or enter into any
release of that security or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any floating charge or
any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be considered necessary or
desirable;

(ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release:

(A) that Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing liabilities, its
guarantee liabilities and its other liabilities;

(B) any security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over any of its assets; and

(C) any other claim of an intra-group lender, a subordinated creditor, or another Debtor over that
Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor,

on behalf of the relevant creditors, Senior Agent, senior arrangers, Debtors, Senior Secured Notes
Trustee, Pari Passu Debt Representative and the Senior Unsecured Note Trustee;

(iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor to
release:

(A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of its
borrowing liabilities, its guarantee liabilities and its other liabilities;

(B) any security granted by any subsidiary of that holding company over any of its assets; and

(C) any other claim of an intra-group lender, a subordinated creditor or another Debtor over the assets
of that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company,

on behalf of the relevant creditors, Senior Agent, senior arrangers, Debtors, Senior Secured Notes
Trustee, Pari Passu Debt Representative and the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee;

(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of
a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Group Priority Agreement) decides to
dispose of all or any part of the liabilities or the Debtor liabilities owed by that Debtor or holding
company or any subsidiary of that Debtor or holding company:

(A) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Group Priority Agreement) does not intend
that any transferee of those liabilities or Debtor liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a
Primary Creditor or a secured party for the purposes of the Group Priority Agreement), to execute
and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities or Debtor
liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of any debt document, the
Transferee shall not be treated as a Primary Creditor or a secured party for the purposes of the
Group Priority Agreement; and

(B) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Group Priority Agreement) does intend that
any Transferee will be treated as a Primary Creditor or a secured party for the purposes of the
Group Priority Agreement), to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all
(and not part only) of the liabilities owed to the Primary Creditors and all or part of any other
liabilities and the Debtor liabilities, on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors and Debtors;

(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of
a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Group Priority
Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all or any part of the

107


-----

Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of any subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of
the intra-group liabilities or the Debtor liabilities, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to:

(A) agree to the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or
Debtor liabilities on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to which those
obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and

(B) (provided the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also a
guarantor of senior secured liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in
respect of those intra-group liabilities or Debtor liabilities on behalf of the Receiving Entity or
Receiving Entities to which the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or Debtor
liabilities are to be transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities or Debtor
liabilities) shall be paid to the Security Agent (as the case may be) for application in accordance with the
provisions set out below under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” as if those proceeds were the proceeds of
an enforcement of the security and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities or Debtor liabilities has occurred,
as if that disposal of liabilities or Debtor liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities as described in (iv)(B) above) effected by, or
at the request of, the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Group Priority Agreement), the Security
Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions (though the
Security Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in
order to achieve a higher price).

Where borrowing liabilities in respect of any senior secured debt would otherwise be released pursuant to
the Group Priority Agreement, the creditor concerned may elect to have those borrowing liabilities transferred to
a holding company or any other Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer in which case the Security Agent is irrevocably
authorised (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer and without any consent,
sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor) to execute such documents as are
required to so transfer those borrowing liabilities.

If on or after the date that Senior Unsecured Notes are issued, but before the discharge date for such Senior
Unsecured Notes, a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that the Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantees and
the Proceeds Loans will be released pursuant to the Group Priority Agreement, it is a further condition to the
release that either:

    - the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee has approved the release; or

    - where shares or assets of a Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantor or assets of the Senior Unsecured Notes
Issuer are sold:

(A) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash);

(B) all claims of the Senior Secured Creditors against a member of the Bank Group (if any), all of
whose shares are pledged in favor of the senior finance parties are sold or disposed of pursuant to
such Enforcement Action, are unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of
concurrently with such sale (and not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all
security under the security documents in respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is
simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with such sale; and

(C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made:

(I) pursuant to a public auction; or

(II) where an independent internationally recognized investment bank or an independent
internationally recognised firm of accountants or a reputable independent internationally
recognized third party professional firm regularly engaged in providing valuations in respect
of the relevant type and size of asset, in each case selected by the Security Agent (acting on
the instructions of the Instructing Group) has delivered an opinion in respect of such sale or
disposal that the amount received in connection therewith is fair from a financial point of
view, taking into account all relevant circumstances, including the method of enforcement
provided that, the liability of such investment bank or internationally recognised firm of
accountants or other third party firm in giving such opinion may be limited to the amount of
its fees in respect of such engagement; and

108


-----

(D) the proceeds are applied in accordance with the caption “—Application of Proceeds”, below.

For the purposes of clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), and (v) above and the immediately preceding clause (C), the
Security Agent shall act:

    - if the relevant Distressed Disposal is being effected by way of enforcement of the security, in
accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “—Manner of Enforcement” above; and

    - in any other case, (a) on the instructions of the Instructing Group or (b) in the absence of any such
instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit.

**_Application of Proceeds_**

The Group Priority Agreement provides that all amounts from time to time received or recovered by the
Security Agent pursuant to the terms of any debt document or in connection with the realization or enforcement
of all or any part of the security (for the purposes of this section, the “Bank Group Recoveries”) shall be held by
the Security Agent on trust, to the extent legally permitted, to apply them at any time as the Security Agent (in its
discretion) sees fit, to the extent permitted by applicable law (and subject to the provisions of this section), in the
following order of priority:

(i) in discharging any sums owing to the Security Agent, any receiver or any delegate on a pari passu
basis;

(ii) in discharging all sums owing to the Senior Agent, Pari Passu Debt Representative and Senior Secured
Notes Trustee (in each case in their capacity as such) on a pari passu basis;

(iii) in payment of all costs and expenses incurred by any agent or Senior Secured Creditor in connection
with any realization or enforcement of the security taken in accordance with the terms of the Group
Priority Agreement or any action taken at the request of the Security Agent under the Group Priority
Agreement;

(iv) in payment to:

(A) the Senior Agent on its own behalf and on behalf of the senior arrangers and the Senior Lenders;

(B) each Pari Passu Debt Representative on its own behalf and on behalf of the Pari Passu Creditors;

(C) each Senior Secured Notes Trustee on its own behalf and on behalf of the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes; and

(D) each Hedge Counterparty,

for application towards the discharge of:

(I) the liabilities of the Debtors owed to the arrangers under the Original Credit Facility and the
Senior Lender Liabilities (in accordance with the terms of the senior finance documents);

(II) the Pari Passu Liabilities (in accordance with the terms of the Pari Passu Debt Documents);

(III) the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities (in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture); and

(IV) the Hedging Liabilities (on a pro rata basis between the Hedging Liabilities of each Hedge
Counterparty),

on a pro rata basis and ranking pari passu between the four immediately preceding paragraphs (I), (II),
(III) and (IV) above;

(v) (in respect of amounts received in respect of guarantee liabilities or the proceeds loan) in payment to
the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee for application towards the discharge of the Senior Unsecured
Notes Liabilities; and

(vi) the balance, if any, in payment to the relevant Debtor.

**_Equalization of the Senior Secured Creditors_**

The Group Priority Agreement provides that if, for any reason, any senior secured liabilities remain unpaid
after the enforcement date and the resulting losses are not borne by the Senior Secured Creditors in the
proportions which their respective exposures at the enforcement date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the

109


-----

Senior Secured Creditors at the enforcement date, the Senior Secured Creditors (subject, in the case of amounts
owing to the trustees, to the terms of the Group Priority Agreement) will make such payments amongst
themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put the Senior Secured Creditors in such a position that (after
taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions.

**_Required Consents_**

The Group Priority Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, it may be amended or waived
only with the consent of the agents (including the Senior Agent), the Majority Lenders (as defined in the Existing
Credit Facility), the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the Pari Passu Debt Representative, the Senior Unsecured
Notes Trustee, the Security Agent and ABC B.V.

An amendment or waiver of the Group Priority Agreement that has the effect of changing or which relates
to, among other things, the provisions set out in this section under the caption “—Required Consents”, he
provisions set out above under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” or the order of priority or subordination
under the Group Priority Agreement shall not be made without the consent of:

(i) the agents (including the Senior Agent);

(ii) the Senior Lenders;

(iii) the Pari Passu Debt Representative;

(iv) the Senior Secured Notes Trustee;

(v) the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee;

(vi) each Hedge Counterparty (to the extent that the amendment or waiver would adversely affect the
Hedge Counterparty); and

(vii) the Security Agent.

The Group Priority Agreement may be amended by the agent (including the Senior Agent), the Senior
Secured Notes Trustee, the Pari Passu Debt Representative, the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee and the Security
Agent, without the consent of any other party, to cure defects, resolve ambiguities or reflect changes in each case
of a minor technical or administrative nature or as otherwise prescribed by the relevant finance documents.

Each note trustee shall, to the extent consented to by the requisite percentage of noteholders in accordance
with the relevant indenture, act on such instructions in accordance therewith unless to the extent any amendments
so consented to relate to any provision affecting the rights and obligations of a trustee in its capacity as such.

_Amendments and Waivers: Security Documents_

Subject to the paragraph below and to certain exceptions under the Group Priority Agreement and unless the
provisions of any debt document expressly provide otherwise, the Security Agent may, if authorised by an
Instructing Group, and if ABC B.V. consents, amend the terms of, waive any of the requirements of or grant
consents under, any of the security documents which shall be binding on each party to the Group Priority
Agreement.

Subject to the second and third paragraphs of the section captioned “—Exceptions” below, the prior consent
of each class of Senior Secured Creditors is required to authorise any amendment or waiver of, or consent under,
any security document which would adversely affect the nature or scope of the charged property or the manner in
which the proceeds of enforcement of the security are distributed.

_Exceptions_

Subject to the two paragraphs immediately below, if the amendment, waiver or consent may impose new or
additional obligations on, or withdraw or reduce the rights of, any party other than:

(i) in the case of a Primary Creditor, in a way which affects, or would affect, Primary Creditors of that
party’s class generally; or

(ii) in the case of a Debtor, to the extent consented to by ABC B.V. under the Group Priority Agreement,

the consent of that party is required.

110


-----

Subject to the paragraph immediately below, an amendment, waiver or consent which relates to the rights or
obligations of an agent, an arranger, the Security Agent (including, without limitation, any ability of the Security
Agent to act in its discretion under the Group Priority Agreement) may not be effected without the consent of
that agent or, as the case may be, that senior arranger, or the Security Agent.

Neither of the two immediately preceding paragraphs shall apply:

    - to any release of security, claim or liabilities; or

    - to any consent,

which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in accordance with the provisions set out in the caption “—
_Proceeds of Disposals” above._

_Agreement to Override_

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Group Priority Agreement, the Group Priority Agreement overrides
anything in the debt documents to the contrary. However, such override, as between any creditor and any Debtor
or any member of the Bank Group, will not cure, postpone, waive or negate any breach, default or event of
default under any debt document as provided in the relevant debt document.

**_Governing Law_**

The Group Priority Agreement is governed by and is to be construed in accordance with English law. The
terms of the Holdco Priority Agreement are summarized below.

**Holdco Priority Agreement**

A priority agreement (the “Holdco Priority Agreement”) dated 27 January 2014 as amended 20 February
2014 and as amended and restated on 4 July 2014, between, among others, Ziggo Bond Company as Parent (the
“Parent”) together with Zesko B.V. as Security Grantor (as defined therein) and Deutsche Trustee Company
Limited as Security Agent (the “Security Agent”).

**_General_**

The Holdco Priority Agreement sets out, among other things, the relative ranking of certain debt of the
Senior Obligors, when payments can be made in respect of certain debt of the Senior Obligors, when
enforcement action can be taken in respect of that debt, the terms pursuant to which certain of that debt will be
subordinated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events and turnover provisions.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions, among others, that are contained in the
Holdco Priority Agreement. It does not restate the Holdco Priority Agreement in its entirety. As such, you are
urged to read the Holdco Priority Agreement because it, and not the discussion that follows, defines certain rights
of the parties thereto.

**_Pari Passu Debt_**

The Holdco Priority Agreement includes provisions for any debt that may be incurred in the future by a
member of the Group which will rank equally with the existing secured debt of the Senior Obligors (the “Pari
**Passu Debt”). The incurrence of the Pari Passu Debt will be subject to compliance with the applicable indenture**
and any Pari Passu Debt documents that already exist at that time (“Pari Passu Debt Documents”). A creditor of
Pari Passu Debt shall be referred to in this section as a “Pari Passu Creditor”.

**_Ranking and Priority_**

_Priority of Debts_

The Holdco Priority Agreement provides that the liabilities owed by the Senior Obligors in relation to the
2025 Senior Notes and the 2027 Senior Notes, certain hedging obligations, and the Pari Passu Debt Documents
(the “Primary Creditors”) shall rank in right and priority of payment in the following order and are postponed
and subordinated to any prior ranking liabilities as follows:

    - first, the liabilities owed in respect of the 2025 Senior Notes and the 2027 Senior Notes (the “Ziggo
**Senior Notes Liabilities”), the liabilities in relation to certain hedging (the “Hedging Liabilities”),**

111


-----

amounts due to the 2025 Senior Notes and the 2027 Senior Notes trustee and amounts due to the Pari
Passu Creditors (the “Pari Passu Liabilities”) pari passu between themselves and without any
preference between them; and

    - second, the amounts owed by one Senior Obligor to another and certain other subordinated liabilities
_pari passu between themselves and without any preference between them._

_Priority of Security_

The security shall rank and secure the following liabilities (only to the extent that such security is expressed
to secure the relevant liabilities) in the following order:

    - first, the Ziggo Senior Notes Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities and the Pari Passu Liabilities pari
passu and without any preference between them; and

    - second, the balance, if any, in payment to the relevant Senior Obligor.

**_Enforcement of Security_**

_Enforcement Instructions_

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security (as defined therein) unless
instructed otherwise by those Senior Secured Creditors whose senior secured credit participations at that time
aggregate more than 50% of the total senior secured credit participations at that time (the “Instructing Group”).

“Senior Secured Creditors” mean the holders of the 2025 Senior Notes and the 2027 Senior Notes and the
Pari Passu Creditors.

Subject to the security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms the Instructing Group may
give, or refrain from giving, instructions to the Security Agent to enforce, or refrain from enforcing, the security
as they see fit.

No secured party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to enforce, any security
or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the security documents except through the Security Agent.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the security is being enforced as set forth above under the caption “—Enforcement Instructions,” the
Security Agent shall enforce the security in such manner (including, without limitation, the selection of any
administrator of any Senior Obligor or Security Grantor (as defined therein) to be appointed by the Security
Agent) as the Instructing Group shall instruct or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent
sees fit.

_Exercise of Voting Rights_

Each creditor has agreed with the Security Agent that it will cast its vote in any proposal put to the vote by,
or under the supervision of, any judicial or supervisory authority in respect of any insolvency, pre-insolvency or
rehabilitation or similar proceedings relating to any Senior Obligor as instructed by the Security Agent. The
Security Agent shall give instructions for the purposes of this paragraph as directed by the Instructing Group; it
being understood that, absent such instructions, the Security Agent may elect to take no action.

_Waiver of Rights_

To the extent permitted under applicable law and subject to certain provisions of the Holdco Priority
Agreement, each of the secured parties and each Senior Obligor has waived all rights it may otherwise have to
require that the security be enforced in any particular order or manner or at any particular time, or that any sum
received or recovered from any person, or by virtue of the enforcement of any of the security or of any other
security interest, which is capable of being applied in or towards discharge of any of the secured obligations, is
so applied.

112


-----

**_Proceeds of Disposals_**

_Non-Distressed Disposals_

If, in respect of a disposal (a “Non-Distressed Disposal”) of: (a) an asset by a Senior Obligor; or (b) an
asset which is subject to the security, made by a Senior Obligor to a person or persons not a Senior Obligor:

(i) the Parent certifies for the benefit of the Security Agent that that disposal is permitted under or is not
prohibited by the Indenture or the trustee for the 2025 Senior Notes and the 2027 Senior Notes
authorizes the release in accordance with the terms of the Notes finance documents;

(ii) (prior to the Pari Passu Debt discharge date) the Parent certifies for the benefit of the Security Agent
that the disposal is permitted under or is not prohibited by the Pari Passu Debt Documents or the
relevant Pari Passu Debt Representative (as defined therein) authorizes the release in accordance with
the terms of the Pari Passu Debt Documents; and

(iii) that disposal is not a Distressed Disposal (as defined below),

the Security Agent is irrevocably authorised (at the reasonable cost of the relevant Senior Obligor and
without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor) but subject to the following
paragraph:

    - to release the security and any other claim (relating to a debt document) over that asset;

    - where that asset consists of shares in the capital of a Senior Obligor, to release the security and any
other claim, including without limitation, any guarantee liabilities or other liabilities (relating to a debt
document) over that Senior Obligor or its assets and (if any) the subsidiaries of that Senior Obligor and
their respective assets; and

    - to execute and deliver or enter into any release of the security or any claim described in the two
paragraphs above and issue any certificates of non-crystallization of any floating charge or any consent
to dealing that may be reasonably requested by the Parent.

In connection with the transfer of 100% of the shares of the Parent to a subsidiary of Liberty Global, the
Security Agent is irrevocably authorised (at the reasonable cost of the Senior Obligor and without any consent,
sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor) to release the security over those shares (to the
extent such release is necessary to enable the transfer to take place) where concurrently with such release, the
Security Agent is granted the same or substantially equivalent security by such transferee affiliate.

Each release of security or any claim described in the paragraph above shall become effective only upon the
making of the relevant Non-Distressed Disposal.

_Distressed Disposals—General_

A “Distressed Disposal” is a disposal of an asset of a Senior Obligor or the shares in or liabilities or
obligations of a Senior Obligor which is (a) being effected at the request of a Instructing Group in circumstances
where the security has become enforceable, (b) being effected by enforcement of the security or (c) being
disposed of by a Senior Obligor to a person or persons which are not Senior Obligor subsequent to an
acceleration event or the enforcement of any security.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorised (at the
cost of the relevant Senior Obligor and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any
creditor, or new security grantor):

(i) to release the security or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver or enter into any
release of that security or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any floating charge or
any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be considered necessary or

trustee and Pari Passu Debt Representative;

(iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Senior
Obligor to release:

Representative;

(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Senior Obligor or the holding
company of a Senior Obligor and the Security Agent decides to dispose of all or any part of the
liabilities or the Senior Obligor liabilities owed by that Senior Obligor or holding company or any
subsidiary of that Senior Obligor or holding company:

(A) if the Security Agent does not intend that any transferee of those liabilities or Senior Obligor
liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a new Primary Creditor or a secured party for the
purposes of the Holdco Priority Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to
dispose of all or part of those liabilities or Senior Obligor liabilities, provided that,
notwithstanding any other provision of any debt document, the Transferee shall not be treated as a
new Primary Creditor or a secured party for the purposes of the Holdco Priority Agreement; and

(B) if the Security Agent does intend that any Transferee will be treated as a new Primary Creditor or
a secured party for the purposes of the Holdco Priority Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter

Creditors and all or part of any other liabilities and the Senior Obligor liabilities, on behalf of, in
each case, the relevant creditors and Senior Obligors;

(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Senior Obligor or the holding
company of a Senior Obligor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance
with the Holdco Priority Agreement) decides to transfer to another Senior Obligor (the “Receiving
**Entity”) all or any part of the Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of any subsidiary of that**
Disposed Entity in respect of the intra-group liabilities or the Senior Obligor liabilities, to execute and
deliver or enter into any agreement to:

(A) agree to the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or
Senior Obligor liabilities on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Senior Obligors to
which those obligations are owed and on behalf of the Senior Obligors which owe those
obligations; and

(B) (provided, the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also a
guarantor of senior secured liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in
respect of those intra-group liabilities or Senior Obligor liabilities on behalf of the Receiving
Entity or Receiving Entities to which the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or
Senior Obligor liabilities are to be transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities or Senior
Obligor liabilities) shall be paid to the Security Agent (as the case may be) for application in accordance with the
provisions set out below under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” as if those proceeds were the proceeds of
an enforcement of the security and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities or Senior Obligor liabilities has
occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities or Senior Obligor liabilities had not occurred.

Where borrowing liabilities in respect of any senior secured debt would otherwise be released pursuant to the
Holdco Priority Agreement, the creditor concerned may elect to have those borrowing liabilities transferred to a
Security Grantor in which case the Security Agent is irrevocably authorised (at the cost of the relevant Senior Obligor,
or Security Grantor and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor, Senior
Obligor or Security Grantor) to execute such documents as are required to so transfer those borrowing liabilities.

114


-----

For the purposes of clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), and (v) above, the Security Agent shall act:

    - if the relevant Distressed Disposal is being effected by way of enforcement of the security, in
accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “—Manner of Enforcement” above; and

    - in any other case, (a) on the instructions of the Instructing Group or (b) in the absence of any such
instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit.

**_Application of Proceeds_**

The Holdco Priority Agreement provides that all amounts from time to time received or recovered by the
Security Agent pursuant to the terms of any debt document or in connection with the realization or enforcement
of all or any part of the security shall be held by the Security Agent on trust, to the extent legally permitted, to
apply them at any time as the Security Agent (in its discretion) sees fit, to the extent permitted by applicable law
(and subject to the provisions of this section), in the following order of priority:

(i) in discharging any sums owing to the Security Agent, any receiver or any delegate on a pari passu
basis;

(ii) in discharging all sums owing to the Pari Passu Debt Representative and any 2025 Senior Notes trustee
and the 2027 Senior Notes trustee (in each case in their capacity as such) on a pari passu basis;

(iii) in payment of all costs and expenses incurred by any agent or Senior Secured Creditor in connection
with any realization or enforcement of the security taken in accordance with the terms of the Holdco
Priority Agreement or any action taken at the request of the Security Agent under the Holdco Priority
Agreement;

(iv) in payment to:

(A) each Pari Passu Debt Representative on its own behalf and on behalf of the Pari Passu Creditors;

(B) the 2025 Senior Notes and the 2027 Senior Notes trustee on its own behalf and on behalf of the
holders of the 2025 Senior Notes and the 2027 Senior Notes; and

(C) each Hedge Counterparty (as defined therein),

for application towards the discharge of:

(I) the Pari Passu Liabilities (in accordance with the terms of the Pari Passu Debt Documents);
and

(II) the Hedging Liabilities (on a pro rata basis between the Hedging Liabilities of each Hedge
Counterparty),

on a pro rata basis and ranking pari passu between the three immediately preceding
paragraphs (I) and (III) above; and

(D) the balance, if any, in payment to the relevant Senior Obligor or Security Grantor.

**_Equalization of the Senior Secured Creditors_**

The Holdco Priority Agreement provides that if, for any reason, any senior secured liabilities remain unpaid
after the enforcement date and the resulting losses are not borne by the Senior Secured Creditors in the
proportions which their respective exposures at the enforcement date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the
Senior Secured Creditors at the enforcement date, the Senior Secured Creditors (subject, in the case of amounts
owing to the trustees, to the terms of the Holdco Priority Agreement) will make such payments amongst
themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put the Senior Secured Creditors in such a position that (after
taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions.

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Holdco Priority Agreement provides that if any creditor receives or
recovers from any Senior Obligor:

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities which is not
either (x) a payment permitted under the Holdco Priority Agreement or (y) made in accordance with
the provisions set out below under the caption “—Application of Proceeds”;

115


-----

(ii) any amount by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it which does not give effect to
a payment permitted under the Holdco Priority Agreement;

(iii) any amount:

(A) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities:

(I) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of any security; or

(II) as a result of any other litigation or proceedings against a Senior Obligor (other than after the
occurrence of an insolvency event in respect of that Senior Obligor); or

(B) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of an
acceleration event or the enforcement of any security,

other than, in each case, any amount received or recovered in accordance with the provisions set out
below under the caption “—Application of Proceeds”;

(iv) the proceeds of any enforcement of any security except in accordance with the provisions set out below
under the caption “—Application of Proceeds”; or

(v) any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities
owed by any Senior Obligor which is not in accordance with the provisions set out below under the
caption “—Application of Proceeds” and which is made as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an
insolvency event in respect of Senior Obligor,

that creditor will: (i) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off
(x) hold an amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received or
recovered) on trust for the Security Agent and promptly pay that amount to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the terms of the Holdco Priority Agreement and (y) promptly pay an amount equal to the
amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities to the Security Agent for
application in accordance with the terms of the Holdco Priority Agreement; and (ii) in relation to receipts and
recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount equal to that recovery to the Security
Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Holdco Priority Agreement.

**_Required Consents_**

The Holdco Priority Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, it may be amended or waived
only with the consent of the agents, the requisite percentage of the lenders, the 2025 Senior Notes and the 2027
Senior Notes trustee, the Pari Passu Debt Representative, the Security Agent and the Parent.

An amendment or waiver of the Holdco Priority Agreement that has the effect of changing or which relates

of priority or subordination under the Holdco Priority Agreement shall not be made without the consent of:

(i) the agents;

(ii) the lenders;

(iii) the Representatives (as defined therein);

(iv) the 2025 Senior Notes and the 2027 Senior Notes trustee;

(v) each Hedge Counterparty (to the extent that the amendment or waiver would adversely affect the
relevant Hedge Counterparty); and

(vi) the Security Agent.

The Holdco Priority Agreement may be amended by the agent, the 2025 Senior Notes and the 2027 Senior
Notes trustee, the Pari Passu Debt Representative and the Security Agent, without the consent of any other party,
to cure defects, resolve ambiguities or reflect changes in each case of a minor technical or administrative nature
or as otherwise prescribed by the relevant finance documents.

_Amendments and Waivers: Security Documents_

Subject to the paragraph below and to certain exceptions under the Holdco Priority Agreement and unless
the provisions of any debt document expressly provide otherwise, the Security Agent may, if authorised by a

116


-----

Instructing Group, and if the Parent consents, amend the terms of, waive any of the requirements of or grant
consents under, any of the security documents which shall be binding on each party to the Holdco Priority
Agreement.

Subject to the second and third paragraphs of the section captioned “—Exceptions” below, the prior consent
of the representative of each class of Senior Secured Creditors is required to authorise any amendment or waiver
of, or consent under, any security document which would adversely affect the nature or scope of the charged
property or the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the security are distributed.

_Exceptions_

Subject to the two paragraphs immediately below, if the amendment, waiver or consent may impose new or
additional obligations on, or withdraw or reduce the rights of, any party other than:

(i) in the case of a Senior Secured Creditor, in a way which affects, or would affect, Senior Secured
Creditors of that party’s class generally; or

(ii) in the case of a Senior Obligor, to the extent consented to by the Parent under the Holdco Priority
Agreement,

the consent of that party is required.

Subject to the paragraph immediately below, an amendment, waiver or consent which relates to the rights or
obligations of an agent, an arranger, the Security Agent (including, without limitation, any ability of the Security
Agent to act in its discretion under the Holdco Priority Agreement) may not be effected without the consent of
that agent or, as the case may be, that senior arranger, or the Security Agent.

Neither of the two immediately preceding paragraphs shall apply:

    - to any release of security, claim or liabilities; or

    - to any consent,

which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in accordance with the provisions set out in the caption “—
_Proceeds of Disposals” above._

_Agreement to Override_

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Holdco Priority Agreement, the Holdco Priority Agreement
overrides anything in the debt documents to the contrary. However, such override, as between any creditor and
any Senior Obligor, will not cure, postpone, waive or negate any breach, default or event of default under any
debt document as provided in the relevant debt document.

_Governing Law_

The Holdco Priority Agreement is governed by and is to be construed in accordance with English law.

**SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL DOCUMENTS**

**Trust Deed**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer, the Notes Trustee, the Security Trustee, the Registrar, Paying Agent and
Transfer Agent, the Administrator and the Account Bank will enter into the Trust Deed, under which the Notes
will be constituted. Pursuant to the Trust Deed, the Issuer will covenant to (i) pay to or to the order of the Notes
Trustee all interest, principal and other amounts in respect of the Notes, and (ii) comply with the covenants set
out therein. The Trust Deed will also contain provisions in relation to the application of funds of the Issuer both
before and after service of an Enforcement Notice (as defined in Condition 1 (“Definitions and Principles of
_Construction—General Interpretation”)). See Condition 3 (“Status, Priority and Security”)._

Pursuant to the Trust Deed, the Issuer will appoint the Notes Trustee and the Security Trustee. On the Issue
Date, the Trust Deed will also create the security interests over the Notes Collateral, as further described in
“General Description of VodafoneZiggo’s Business, the Issuer and the Offering—Overview of the Structure of the
_Offering of the Notes—Notes Collateral” in favour of the Security Trustee and for the benefit of the Secured_
Parties. Each Secured Party party to the Trust Deed (other than the Security Trustee) will agree that it will not be
entitled to take, and will not take, any steps whatsoever to enforce its rights in respect of the security created by
the Notes Security Documents, or to direct the Security Trustee to do so, save where the Security Trustee has
become bound to do so following service of an Enforcement Notice and has failed to do so within a reasonable
period of time. The Trust Deed will contain representations by the Issuer to the effect that the Issuer was and will
be, subject to the security interests created by the relevant Notes Security Document, absolutely entitled to such
Notes Collateral free from all encumbrances of any kind, other than Permitted Encumbrances (as defined therein).

If an Issuer Event of Default (as defined in Condition 10 (“Issuer Events of Default”) occurs and is
continuing, the Notes Trustee may, and upon the instructions of Noteholders (including by an Extraordinary
Resolution) shall declare all the Notes to be due or payable in accordance with the Conditions and the Trust
Deed; provided that, upon the occurrence of an Issuer Event of Default described in Condition 10(b)(v) (“Issuer
_Events of Default—Events”), the Note Acceleration Notice (as defined in Condition 10(a) (“Issuer Events of_
_Default—Determination of an Issuer Event of Default”)) will be deemed to have been given and all the Notes_
will immediately become due and payable. See Condition 10 (“Issuer Events of Default”) included elsewhere in
this Offering Circular for full list of events constituting an Issuer Event of Default under the Trust Deed.
Following the service of a Note Acceleration Notice on the Issuer, the Security Trustee or the Noteholders may
serve an Enforcement Notice on the Issuer, declaring the security created by the Notes Security Documents to be
enforceable. Upon receipt of any Enforcement Notice, the Issuer will be required to promptly (within 10
Business Days) deliver to the Obligors an Obligor Enforcement Notification pursuant to the Framework
Assignment Agreement, in accordance with Condition 11(b) (“Enforcement—Enforcement Notice”).

The Trust Deed will contain provisions requiring each of the Notes Trustee and the Security Trustee (except
where expressly provided otherwise) to have regard to the interests of the Noteholders as a single class in the
exercise and performance of all its powers, trusts, authorities, duties and discretions. If, in the opinion of the
Notes Trustee or Security Trustee, as the case may be, there is a conflict of interest between the interests of two
or more groups of Noteholders, the Notes Trustee or the Security Trustee, as the case may be, will have regard
only to the interests of, and will take instructions from, the group which holds the greater amount of Notes
outstanding. The Trust Deed further stipulates that, so long as any of the Notes remain outstanding, the Notes
Trustee and the Security Trustee, as the case may be, shall have no regard to the interests of any Secured Party
other than the Noteholders, or to the interests of any other person.

The Trust Deed contains standard limited recourse and non-petition provisions with respect to the Issuer.

The Trust Deed will be governed by English law.

**Agency and Account Bank Agreement**

On or about the Issue Date, the Issuer, VodafoneZiggo, the Notes Trustee, the Security Trustee, the
Administrator, the Account Bank, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar (each of the
Administrator, the Account Bank, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar an “Agent” and
together, the “Agents”) will enter into an English law agency and account bank agreement (the “Agency and
**Account Bank Agreement”). Pursuant to the Agency and Account Bank Agreement, the Issuer will appoint:**

Facilities Loans advanced, by the Issuer in order to, inter alia, make certain specified calculations,

connection with the aforementioned duties, including (but not limited to), six Business Days prior to
each Interest Payment Date, calculation of any Term Shortfall Payment or Term Excess Arrangement
Payment (each as defined in “General Description of VodafoneZiggo’s Business, the Issuer and the
_Offering—Overview of the Structure of the Offering of the Notes”) to be made between the Issuer and_
VodafoneZiggo, and (g) notify VodafoneZiggo if such periodic payments arising from maturing
Assigned Receivables and payments of interest and principal arising from New VFZ Facilities Loans
are not received in full or if, for any reason, there are insufficient funds standing to the credit of the
relevant Issuer Transaction Account for the transfer of any sums previously determined by the
Administrator;

(ii) the Account Bank to: (a) hold such monies as may be deposited from time to time with it in the

income promptly upon receipt thereof to the relevant Issuer Transaction Account;

(iii) the Paying Agent to act as the paying agent of the Issuer with respect to payments of principal, interest,
or any other payments in respect of the Notes (including, without limitation, prepayments) of which it
is notified by the Notes Trustee, the Administrator (acting on behalf of the Issuer) or the Issuer;

(iv) the Transfer Agent to act as its agent in facilitating transfers of the Notes, in accordance with the Trust
Deed, on behalf of the Issuer; and

(v) the Registrar to: (a) register all transfers of Notes, (b) receive any document in relation to or affecting
the title to any of the Notes, including all forms of transfer, forms of exchange, probates, letters of
administration and powers of attorney, (c) maintain proper records of the details of all documents
received by itself or the Transfer Agent, (d) prepare all such lists of Noteholders as may be required by
the Issuer, the Notes Trustee or the Paying Agent or any person authorized by any of the foregoing and
(e) notify the Paying Agent, upon its request and not less than seven days prior to each Interest
Payment Date, of the names and addresses of all registered Noteholders at the close of business on the
record date specified as well as the amounts of their holdings in order to enable the Paying Agent to
make or arrange for payment to the Noteholders of interest payable in respect of the Notes or amounts
required to redeem the Notes, as the case may be;

Each Agent may resign its appointment at any time, and shall not be obliged to provide any reason for such
resignation or be responsible for any expenses or other liabilities incurred by the Issuer, by giving the Issuer
(with a copy to the Administrator and the Notes Trustee) at least 60 days’ prior written notice or, with respect to
the Administrator only, 180 days’ prior written notice to that effect, provided that no such notice shall take effect
until a replacement agent which agrees to exercise the powers and undertake the duties conferred and imposed
upon such Agent has been appointed.

The Issuer may, at any time, with the prior written approval of the Notes Trustee (except with respect to the
Administrator and the Account Bank, in which case no such prior written approval shall be required), appoint
additional Agents and/or terminate the appointment of any Agent by giving to the Administrator, the Notes
Trustee, the Security Trustee, the Agent concerned and the other Agents at least 60 days’ prior written notice to
that effect, provided that it will maintain at all times a Registrar, Paying Agent, Account Bank, Administrator
and/or Transfer Agent and provided always that no such notice shall take effect until a new Registrar, Paying
Agent, Account Bank, Administrator and/or Transfer Agent, as applicable (approved in advance in writing by the
Notes Trustee) which agrees to exercise the powers and undertake the duties conferred and imposed upon such
Agent has been appointed.

The Agency and Account Bank Agreement contains standard limited recourse and non-petition provisions
with respect to the Issuer.

The Agency and Account Bank Agreement will be governed by English law.

**Framework Assignment Agreement**

On or about the Issue Date, the Issuer, as purchaser, will enter into the Framework Assignment Agreement
with, among others, the Platform Provider, the Buyer Parent and The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch
as administrator. Under the Framework Assignment Agreement, from time to time commencing on the Issue
Date, the Issuer may purchase and have assigned to it on a non-recourse basis, up to the Purchase Limits (as
defined elsewhere in this Offering Circular) specified in the applicable Assignment Framework Notes, and the
Platform Provider may sell and assign on a non-recourse basis, eligible VFZ Accounts Receivable that are made
available by Suppliers and uploaded by the Buyer Entities to the SCF Platform.

Each VFZ Account Receivable to be purchased by the Issuer must meet, and the Buyer Parent will represent
and warrant (on behalf of itself and as agent for the Buyer Entities) on the date of each Assignment (each such
date, an “Assignment Date”) in accordance with the Framework Assignment Agreement, that such VFZ Account
Receivable meets, the following eligibility criteria: that such VFZ Account Receivable (i) (with respect to the
Payment Obligation component of such VFZ Account Receivable only) is owed by the Obligors on a joint and
several basis; (ii) (with respect to the Payment Obligation component of such VFZ Account Receivable only) is
governed by English law; (iii) is denominated in euro; (iv) (with respect to the Payment Obligation component of
such VFZ Account Receivable only) is the legal, valid and binding obligation of each Obligor; (v) is capable of
being freely and validly transferred in the manner provided by the Framework Assignment Agreement, so that on
purchase the Issuer will receive good title; (vi) is due and payable in full without any right of set-off,
counterclaim or deduction in favour of the Buyer Entities; and (vii) has a maturity date that is no later than two
Business Days prior to the Maturity Date of the Notes. As long as the VFZ Account Receivables to be purchased
by the Issuer meet such eligibility criteria, there are no other selection or allocation criteria applied by the
Platform Provider.

Additionally, immediately prior to each Assignment Date, the Platform Provider will represent and warrant
that it is entitled to assign the relevant Payment Obligation pursuant to the terms of the Framework Assignment
Agreement, and that it has not assigned, transferred or otherwise disposed of, or created any encumbrance or
security interest over, such Payment Obligation. Furthermore, the Platform Provider will provide certain
undertakings, including, among other things: (a) that it shall comply in a timely manner with its obligations under
the relevant SCF Platform Documents with respect to each Assignment Framework Note and exercise the same
degree of care with regard to the Payment Obligations relating thereto as it would if it had not entered into such
Assignment Framework Note; (b) that it shall not, without the prior written consent of the Issuer, take any action
that would adversely affect a Payment Obligation or the Issuer’s interest(s) therein (including any extension of
the date for payment of any Payment Obligation, any reduction, cancellation or termination of the amount or in
the liability of any Obligor in respect of any Payment Obligation (including in relation to any credit note,
discount or right of set-off), and any other change which would materially prejudice the interests or rights of the
Issuer); and (c) that it may, without the prior written consent of the Issuer, take such action that would result in
any increase in the amount of VFZ Accounts Receivable which are not Assigned Receivables, or any extension
in the date for payment of any VFZ Accounts Receivable which are not Assigned Receivables, provided that
such action does not affect the rights or obligations of the Issuer under the Framework Assignment Agreement or
in respect of any Assigned Receivables. The Platform Provider will also provide certain information
undertakings, including: (a) that it shall provide the Issuer and the Administrator within five Business Days at the
start of each calendar month with an overview of the Assigned Receivables that have not, as at the last day of the
preceding calendar month, been settled in accordance with the Framework Assignment Agreement; and (b) that if
the Issuer or Administrator requests in writing copies of the SCF Platform Documents, it shall, within a
reasonable timeframe and in any event within five Business Days of such request, provide the Issuer and the
Administrator with copies of such documentation.

Each Payment Obligation will be the joint and several obligation of VodafoneZiggo and each of the Obligor
Subsidiaries. On the Issue Date, the eligible Obligor Subsidiaries will be VZ Financing I B.V. and VZ Financing
II B.V. (each, an “Obligor Subsidiary” and collectively, the “Obligor Subsidiaries”, together with the Buyer
Parent, the “Obligors”).

**_Purchases of VFZ Accounts Receivable with Requested Purchase Price Amounts_**

On or following the Issue Date (as further described in “Description of VodafoneZiggo —Capitalization of
_VodafoneZiggo” included elsewhere in this Offering Circular), the Platform Provider is expected to sell and_

122


-----

assign to the Issuer VFZ Accounts Receivable for a Requested Purchase Price Amount of €400.0 million, which
the Issuer will fund with all or a portion of the Committed Principal Proceeds. See “Use of Proceeds”. It is
expected that the Issuer will complete its initial purchases of new and existing VFZ Accounts Receivable by
31 March 2020. In connection with such sale and assignment, the Platform Provider will deliver to the Issuer:

1. an Assignment Framework Note to be accepted and agreed to by the Issuer, pursuant to which the
Issuer will agree, among other things, to purchase Payment Obligations (and the Receivables related
thereto, solely to the extent that such Receivables have been acquired by the Platform Provider), in
whole but not in part, at the relevant Purchase Price Amounts in an aggregate amount equal to a limit
(in respect of purchased Payment Obligations which have not been settled) specified therein (the
“Purchase Limit”); and

2. one or more Assignment Notices instructing the Issuer to pay to the Platform Provider, as consideration
for the sale and assignment of the relevant VFZ Accounts Receivable, a requested amount (a
“Requested Purchase Price Amount”) on the date falling five Business Days following receipt by the
Issuer of such Assignment Notice (a “Value Date”).

As used herein, a “Purchase Price Amount” means, in relation to any VFZ Account Receivable, an amount
equal to the Outstanding Amount (as defined in the context of the Framework Assignment Agreement) (as
defined below) of such VFZ Account Receivable less the Applied Discount (as defined below) calculated as at
the relevant Assignment Date. “Outstanding Amount” means, with respect to a Payment Obligation, an amount
equal to (i) the gross amount of the Approved Platform Receivable in respect of which the Payment Obligation
arose, less (ii) the sum of all Credit Notes allocated to that Payment Obligation pursuant to the terms of the
APMSA. “Applied Discount” refers (i) in the context of the APMSA, to the discount amount that the Platform
Provider will deduct from the Certified Amount in case of a transfer of the Payment Obligation prior to the
Confirmed Payment Date pursuant to the terms of the APMSA and each relevant Discounted Payments Purchase
Agreement and (ii) in the context of the Framework Assignment Agreement to the discount amount that the
Platform Provider will deduct from the Certified Amount in the case of a transfer of the Payment Obligation prior
to the Confirmed Payment Date pursuant to the terms of the APSMA and each relevant Discounted Payments
Purchase Agreement, less the Platform Provider Processing Fee.

From time to time following the Issue Date, the Platform Provider may, at its discretion (but not more than
once per week prior to the service of a notice of termination (as further described below)) and to the extent that
the Requested Purchase Price Amount specified in such Assignment Notice together with all other outstanding
Requested Purchase Price Amounts which have not been applied towards the purchase of VFZ Accounts
Receivable would not exceed €50.0 million at such time (the “Requested Purchase Price Amount Aggregate
**Limit”), serve further Assignment Notices (which may also be Primary Assignment Notices (as defined and**
further described below under “—Collections on Assigned Receivables and Further Purchases of VFZ Accounts
_Receivable with Collected Principal Amounts”)) to the Issuer pursuant to the relevant Assignment Framework_
Note.

Following the receipt of an Assignment Notice, so long as no Non-Compliance Event (as defined below) has
occurred and is continuing, the Issuer will pay, on the relevant Value Date, the relevant Requested Purchase Price
Amount (which may be adjusted as further described below) to the Platform Provider, which shall have the effect
of the Platform Provider immediately selling and assigning, without further action on the part of any person or
entity, all of its rights, title and interest in and to the relevant Payment Obligations (and the Receivables related
thereto, solely to the extent that such Receivables have been acquired by the Platform Provider) at the relevant
Purchase Price Amounts to the Issuer pursuant to the relevant Assignment Framework Note.

The assignment of any Payment Obligation (and the Receivable in respect of which such Payment
Obligation has arisen, solely to the extent that such Receivable has been acquired by the Platform Provider) from
the Platform Provider to the Issuer (pursuant to the Framework Assignment Agreement and as described above),
is referred to herein as an “Assignment”.

The Requested Purchase Price Amount (and the corresponding VFZ Accounts Receivable) will be adjusted
if the aggregate of all Requested Purchase Price Amounts, together with (without double counting) the aggregate
of all Purchase Price Amounts in respect of outstanding Assigned Receivables would be higher than the relevant
Purchase Limit specified in that Assignment Framework Note. In such event, the Issuer must notify the Platform
Provider within two Business Days of receipt of the relevant Assignment Notice (i) of such circumstance and
(ii) that the Requested Purchase Price Amount will (A) be reduced to equal the amount which would cause the
aggregate Requested Purchase Price Amount, together with (without double counting) the aggregate of all

123


-----

Purchase Price Amounts in respect of outstanding Assigned Receivables to equal such Purchase Limit and/or
(B) cancelled to the extent necessary such that the relevant assignment is for the whole, and not part, of the VFZ
Accounts Receivable.

The Issuer will not be obliged to pay a Requested Purchase Price Amount specified in an Assignment Notice
if any of the following events (each, a “Non-Compliance Event”) have occurred and is continuing (provided that
the Issuer notifies the Platform Provider, within two Business Days of the receipt of such Assignment Notice,
that one or more Non-Compliance Events have occurred and of the Issuer’s intention not to comply with such
Assignment Notice): (i) if the Framework Assignment Agreement or relevant Assignment Framework Note has
been terminated prior to the date of such Assignment Notice; (ii) if the terms and conditions of such Assignment
Notice materially deviate from the terms and conditions of the Framework Assignment Agreement or the
relevant Assignment Framework Note; (iii) if an Obligor Event of Default (as defined below) is continuing in
respect of any Obligor; and/or (iv) if a specified insolvency event occurs in respect of the Platform Provider
which directly results in the Platform Provider not continuing its business as contemplated under the Framework
Assignment Agreement. If, following the receipt of a Requested Purchase Price Amount on a Value Date, the
Platform Provider has acquired (or determines that it will on such Value Date acquire) insufficient VFZ Accounts
Receivable to apply the whole of the Requested Purchase Price Amount received on such Value Date, the
Platform Provider will either (i) serve, on such Value Date, one or more notices (substantially in the form set out
in the Framework Assignment Agreement, each a “Purchase Price Return Notice”) to the Issuer and, on the
Business Day following the date of such Purchase Price Return Notice (a “Settlement Date”), pay to the Issuer
Collection Account, the excess Requested Purchase Price Amount not applied towards the purchase of VFZ
Accounts Receivable (such excess, the “Excess Requested Purchase Price Amount”); or (ii) retain such Excess
Requested Purchase Price Amount for a period of up to four Business Days following such Value Date (an
“Excess Retention Period”, and the final day thereof (which, at the Platform Provider’s discretion, may occur
prior to the fourth Business Day following such Value Date), the “Excess Retention Period End Date”) to be
applied towards the purchase of any VFZ Accounts Receivable arising during such Excess Retention Period. If
the Platform Provider chooses to retain such Excess Requested Purchase Price Amount, it further agrees that (i) if
the Platform Provider acquires any VFZ Accounts Receivable during such Excess Retention Period, it will sell
and assign such VFZ Accounts Receivables to the Issuer (and the Platform Provider will be deemed to have
served an Assignment Notice in respect of such Assigned Receivables); and (ii) on the Business Day prior to the
Excess Retention Period End Date, the Platform Provider will serve a Purchase Price Return Notice in respect of
any remaining Excess Requested Purchase Price Amount to the Issuer, and subsequently pay such remaining
Excess Requested Purchase Price Amount to the Issuer Collection Account on such Excess Retention Period End
Date, together with all Excess Requested Purchase Price Interest (as defined below) due in respect thereof.
“Excess Requested Purchase Price Interest” shall accrue daily at the Funding Rate, calculated on any Excess
Requested Purchase Price Amount retained by the Platform Provider (and not applied towards the purchase of
VFZ Accounts Receivable), from (and including) the first day of the relevant Excess Retention Period to (and
including) the relevant Excess Retention Period End Date, or such later date on which the Issuer receives such
Excess Requested Purchase Price Amount together with all interest due in respect thereof. As used herein,
“Funding Rate” means a rate equal to the per annum margin specified in Clause 13.1 of the APMSA (less the
Platform Provider Processing Fee) over 1-month EURIBOR; provided that if 1-month EURIBOR is less than
zero, 1-month EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero.

Additionally, if on any Business Day the aggregate Requested Purchase Price Amounts held by the Platform
Provider (and not applied towards the purchase of VFZ Accounts Receivable) exceeds the Requested Purchase
Price Amount Aggregate Limit (such excess, an “Aggregate Amount Excess”), the Platform Provider will
immediately serve a Purchase Price Return Notice in respect of such Aggregate Amount Excess, and pay such
Aggregate Amount Excess to the Issuer Collection Account on the relevant Settlement Date. Any Aggregate
Amount Excess not returned to the Issuer by the relevant Settlement Date (such amount, a “Delayed Aggregate
**Amount”) shall accrue interest daily at the Funding Rate, calculated from (and including) such Settlement Date**
to (and including) such later date on which the Issuer receives the Delayed Aggregate Amount, together with all
interest due in respect thereof (the “Delayed Aggregate Amount Interest”).

**_Collections on Assigned Receivables and Further Purchases of VFZ Accounts Receivable with Collected_**
**_Principal Amounts_**

Prior to the service of an Obligor Enforcement Notification, the Platform Provider will act as collection
agent for the Issuer in respect of any Collected Amounts received or recovered relating to Assigned Receivables,
in accordance with the SCF Platform Documents. Except in circumstances where certain Collected Principal
Amounts are applied towards the purchase of new VFZ Accounts Receivable (as further described below), the

124


-----

Platform Provider will apply any Collected Amount, within one Business Day of receipt or recovery thereof
(such scheduled date of application, a “Collected Amount Forwarding Date”), in or towards the repayment to
the Issuer of an amount equal to the Outstanding Amount of the relevant Assigned Receivables (to the extent that
such Assigned Receivables remain outstanding and has not been settled or otherwise paid to the Issuer).

From time to time, the Platform Provider may serve an Assignment Notice (a “Primary Assignment
**Notice”) which states that any Collected Principal Amounts in respect of Assigned Receivables relating to such**
Primary Assignment Notice are to be treated as further payments of Requested Purchase Price Amounts. So long
as (i) no Non-Compliance Event has occurred and is continuing (and in respect of which the Issuer has notified
the Platform Provider that the purchase mechanics described in this paragraph will not apply), (ii) the Requested
Purchase Price Amount Aggregate Limit will not be exceeded upon the deemed payment of the Requested
Purchase Price Amount in the New Assignment Notice (as defined below), upon receipt by the Platform Provider
of any Collected Amount on an Assigned Receivable relating to such Primary Assignment Notice, or (iii) no
notice of termination has been served (as further described below), then (a) the Platform Provider will be deemed
to have served an Assignment Notice on exactly the same terms as the Primary Assignment Notice, except for the
Requested Purchase Price Amount (which will be equal to the Collected Principal Amount that would otherwise
be due and payable to the Issuer) (such notice, the “New Assignment Notice”); and (b) the Platform Provider’s
obligation to pay such Collected Principal Amount to the Issuer will be set off against the Issuer’s obligation to
pay the Requested Purchase Price Amount under the New Assignment Notice. For the avoidance of doubt, the
purchase mechanics described in this paragraph will not affect the Platform Provider’s obligation to pay to the
Issuer any Premium on the relevant Collected Amount Forwarding Date. If, three Business Days following the
service of a New Assignment Notice, the Platform Provider still holds any Collected Amounts which have not
been utilised for the purchase of new VFZ Accounts Receivable (such amounts, “Unutilised Collected
**Amounts”), the Platform Provider will immediately serve a Purchase Price Return Notice to the Issuer in respect**
of such Unutilised Collected Amounts, and will pay such Unutilised Collected Amounts to the Issuer Collection
Account on the relevant Settlement Date. The Platform Provider will pay the Issuer interest on any “Retained
**Collected Amounts” (being any Collected Amount which has not been paid to the Issuer towards satisfaction of**
the relevant Outstanding Amount and not been used to purchase further VFZ Accounts Receivable as described
above). Interest on Retained Collected Amounts shall accrue daily at the Funding Rate, calculated from (and
including) the relevant scheduled Collected Amount Forwarding Date to (and including) the relevant Settlement
Date or such later date on which the Issuer receives the Retained Collected Amount, together with all interest due
in respect thereof, as the case may be, and will be paid to the Issuer Collection Account on the relevant
Settlement Date or such later date, as applicable.

**_Obligor Events of Default and Obligor Enforcement Notification_**

The Issuer may not serve (or cause or permit to be served) a notice to the Obligors informing them of an
Assignment (an “Obligor Enforcement Notification”) prior to the occurrence of (i) a failure by any Obligor to
pay any Payment Obligation in full to the Platform Provider on the date such payment was due (taking into
account any applicable grace period under the APMSA), (ii) a specified insolvency event in respect of any
Obligor, (iii) a breach of the representations and warranties of the Buyer Parent with respect to the eligibility of
the VFZ Accounts Receivable, which is not capable of remedy (or if such breach is capable of remedy, is not
remedied within five Business Days of notice) (each such event in (i) to (iii), an “Obligor Event of Default”), or
(iv) a specified insolvency event in respect of the Platform Provider. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to the
_Receivables and the SCF Platform—The transfer of VFZ Accounts Receivable under the Framework Assignment_
_Agreement takes place only under equity until an Obligor Enforcement Notification is given to the Obligors”._

Following the occurrence of any of the foregoing events, the Issuer may serve or direct the Platform
Provider to serve an Obligor Enforcement Notification (provided that the Platform Provider may, but is not
obliged to, serve an Obligor Enforcement Notification at any time as it sees fit, including upon termination of the
Framework Assignment Agreement or any Assignment Framework Note and/or pursuant to the circumstances
described in the paragraph below).

As soon as reasonably practicable after the occurrence of an Obligor Event of Default, the Platform Provider
will, among other things, (i) provide the Issuer with notice of such Obligor Event of Default and the details
thereof, as well as regular status updates with respect to the affected Assigned Receivables; (ii) turn over to the
Issuer any Purchase Price Return Amount in accordance with the terms of the Framework Assignment
Agreement; (iii) in consultation with the Issuer and the Buyer Parent (provided such consultation is permitted by
the terms of the Framework Assignment Agreement), take (or refrain from taking) any steps that the Platform
Provider sees fit to recover all amounts payable, as well as default interest and other costs and expenses, each as

125


-----

permitted under the APMSA and the relevant Discounted Payments Purchase Agreement(s); (iv) be indemnified
by the Buyer Parent within ten Business Days after the relevant demand for all expenses (including all legal
expenses), costs and losses reasonably incurred and claims incurred in connection with the exercise or
enforcement of any rights in connection with Assigned Receivables; and (v) if an agreement cannot be reached as
to what steps (if any) are to be taken or refrained from being taken following an Obligor Event of Default in
accordance with paragraph (iii) above, the Platform Provider may (or will, if so requested by the Issuer and
provided that the Issuer has complied with its payments obligations under the Framework Assignment
Agreement), serve an Obligor Enforcement Notification on any Obligor, following which the below
consequences will apply in respect of the relevant Assigned Receivables.

Following service of an Obligor Enforcement Notification, the Platform Provider will cease to act as the
Issuer’s collection agent in respect of the relevant Assigned Receivables, and shall hold any amounts received by
it in respect of the relevant Assigned Receivables on behalf of the Issuer.

**_Assignment and Termination_**

The Issuer may assign or transfer its rights under the Framework Assignment Agreement and the
Assignment Framework Notes (including its rights to Assigned Receivables) in the following circumstances:
(a) if such assignment is by way of security by the Issuer as part of the financing activities of the Issuer
(including as part of a capital markets transaction) (the “Issuer’s Financing Activities) or in connection with the
enforcement of such security; or (b) with the prior written consent of each other party to the Framework
Assignment Agreement (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided that the Issuer may
assign or transfer its rights or obligations under the Framework Assignment Agreement or (in accordance with
the procedures described in the following paragraph) under an Assignment Framework Note and all related
Assigned Receivables to a transferee, in each case with the Platform Provider’s approval (at its sole discretion;
_provided further that the Platform Provider’s approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed for an_
assignment or transfer by the Issuer which is contemplated by or permitted under the transaction documents
entered into in connection with the Issuer’s Financing Activities). Similarly, the Platform Provider may assign or
transfer its rights under the Framework Assignment Agreement in the same such specified circumstances;
_provided, however, that the Platform Provider may assign or transfer any of its rights in Assigned Receivables to_
an affiliate without the consent of any other party, and may also assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations
under the Framework Assignment Agreement, as the provider and administrator of the SCF Platform, with the
prior written consent of the Issuer (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

Transfer will be effected when the Platform Provider executes an otherwise duly completed transfer
certificate in the form substantially set out in the Framework Assignment Agreement (a “Transfer Certificate”)
delivered to it by the Issuer and the third party transferee. The Platform Provider is only obliged to execute such
Transfer Certificate once it is satisfied that all necessary “know your customer” or other similar checks required
under applicable law have been complied with. Upon such transfer becoming effective, the Platform Provider and
the Issuer shall be released from further obligations towards one another under the relevant Assignment
Framework Note and related Assigned Receivables, the transferee shall become a party to the relevant
Assignment Framework Note in the Issuer’s place, and the Platform Provider shall update its system to designate
the relevant transferee as the owner of the relevant VFZ Accounts Receivable.

The Framework Assignment Agreement and/or any Assignment Framework Note issued thereunder may be
terminated by the Platform Provider upon 10 Business Days’ prior notice to the other parties thereto; provided
_that the effective date of such termination shall not be earlier than the effective date of termination of the_
APMSA (as further described below). See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to the Receivables and the SCF
_Platform—The Framework Assignment Agreement may be terminated without the consent of the Issuer”._
Additionally, the Platform Provider may terminate the Framework Assignment Agreement and/or any
Assignment Framework Note with immediate effect by notice to the other parties upon the occurrence of any of
the following events: (a) a breach of material obligations of the Buyer Parent and/or the Issuer (subject to a 30
days grace period); (b) a material breach of the representations and warranties of the Buyer Parent and/or the
Issuer (subject to a 30 days grace period); or (c) if a specified insolvency event has occurred in respect of the
Buyer Parent and/or the Issuer.

The Framework Assignment Agreement and/or any Assignment Framework Note issued thereunder may
also be terminated by the Issuer upon 10 Business Days’ prior notice to the other parties thereto. Additionally,
the Issuer may terminate the Framework Assignment Agreement and/or any Assignment Framework Note with
immediate effect by notice to the other parties upon the occurrence of any of the following events: (a) a breach of

126


-----

material obligations of the Buyer Parent and/or the Platform Provider (subject to a 30 days grace period); (b) a
material breach of the representation and warranties of the Buyer Parent and/or the Platform Provider (subject to
a 30 days grace period); or (c) if a specified insolvency event has occurred in respect of the Buyer Parent and/or
the Platform Provider, as applicable.

Following the service of a notice of termination of the Framework Assignment Agreement and/or any
Assignment Framework Note: (a) no further Assignment Notices shall be served, and no New Assignment
Notices shall be deemed served, by the Platform Provider; (b) the Platform Provider shall provide the Issuer, as
soon as reasonably practicable after such termination, with a report showing the relevant Assigned Receivables
which have not been settled at such time; (c) the rights of the Platform Provider to demand refunds,
reimbursements or other payments with respect to the relevant Assigned Receivables which have not been settled
at such time, and any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities of any of the parties to the Framework
Assignment Agreement that have accrued up to the effective date of termination, shall not be affected and shall
survive such termination; (d) the Platform Provider may choose to exercise its right to serve an Obligor
Enforcement Notification, as described above; and (e) the parties shall continue to be bound by the relevant
confidentiality provisions in the Framework Assignment Agreement until such later date as set out in the
Framework Assignment Agreement.

The Framework Assignment Agreement contains standard limited recourse and non-petition provisions with
respect to the Issuer.

The Framework Assignment Agreement will be governed by English law.

**Accounts Payable Management Services Agreement**

On 23 February 2015, the Platform Provider and VodafoneZiggo, among others, entered into the Accounts
Payable Management Services Agreement, or the APMSA. Under the terms of the APMSA, the Obligors,
together with certain other subsidiaries of VodafoneZiggo that may accede to the APMSA from time to time as
further described below (collectively, the “Buyer Entities” and each a “Buyer Entity”), may upload Electronic
Data Files containing details of Receivables payable to a Supplier on to the SCF Platform to enable the purchase
by the Platform Provider of such Receivables (and the Parent Payment Obligations arising in respect thereof)
from the relevant Supplier.

On the Issue date, the eligible Buyer Subsidiaries will be Ziggo B.V., Ziggo Services B.V., Vodafone
Libertel B.V. and UPC Nederland B.V. (collectively, the “Non-Obligor Buyer Subsidiaries” and each a “Non**Obligor Buyer Subsidiary”, together with the Obligor Subsidiaries, the “Buyer Subsidiaries” and each a**
“Buyer Subsidiary”), the Obligor Subsidiaries, and the Buyer Parent. Additional Buyer Subsidiaries may accede
to the APMSA by entering into an accession letter (substantially in form set out in the APMSA) with the
Platform Provider and the Buyer Parent, and an existing Buyer Subsidiary may cease to be a “Buyer Entity” for
the purposes of the APMSA if the Platform Provider or Buyer Parent provides written notice to such effect.
Additional Obligor Subsidiaries may become party to the APMSA either by acceding as a “Designated Buyer
Subsidiary” (provided they are specified as such in the relevant accession letter) or, with respect to an existing
Non-Obligor Buyer Subsidiary, if such Non-Obligor Buyer Subsidiary is specified in writing by the Buyer Parent
to be a “Designated Buyer Subsidiary” for purposes of the APMSA. Pursuant to the Agency and Account Bank
Agreement, the Buyer Parent will undertake to the Issuer that the Buyer Parent may notify the Platform Provider
of a resignation of a Obligor Subsidiary only if all Outstanding Amounts owed by such Obligor Subsidiary (as
principal obligor) in respect of its Assigned Receivables have been settled in accordance with the APMSA on or
prior to the date of its resignation, and the Buyer Parent will agree to promptly provide written notification of the
same to the Issuer (or the Administrator on its behalf).

From time to time, a Buyer Entity may execute an Upload and designate such uploaded Receivables as
“approved”. Each Approved Platform Receivable will initially give rise to a Parent Payment Obligation, being an
independent and primary obligation by VodafoneZiggo to make payment or cause payment of the Certified
Amount to be made to the relevant recipient on the Confirmed Payment Date in respect thereof. Each Buyer
Entity agrees that, immediately following such designation, the relevant Obligor shall pay the Certified Amount
in full (without any deduction or withholding) and no Buyer Entity shall be entitled to claim set-off or
counterclaim against any party in relation to the payment of the whole or part of such Certified Amount. Upon
each Initial Transfer (being the sale and assignment of a Parent Payment Obligation and the applicable
Receivable related thereto from the Supplier to the Platform Provider through the SCF Platform), the relevant
Parent Payment Obligation will become a Payment Obligation, pursuant to which each Obligor will become

127


-----

jointly and severally liable with each other Obligor to make payment or cause payment to be made to the relevant
recipient on the Confirmed Payment Date in respect thereof. Each Obligor acknowledges that, upon such Initial
Transfer, it and each other Obligor shall be liable by itself and for each other Obligor to pay the Certified
Amount in full (without any deduction or withholding) and no Obligor shall be entitled to claim set-off or
counterclaim against any party in relation to the payment of the whole or part of such Certified Amount. The
Non-Obligor Buyer Subsidiaries will not be liable for any Payment Obligations.

The obligations of the Buyer Entities described above will not be affected by an act, omission, matter or
thing which, but for the relevant provisions of the Framework Assignment Agreement, would reduce, release or
prejudice any of such obligations, including: (a) any time, waiver or consent granted to, or composition with, any
Buyer Entity or other person; (b) the release of any Buyer Entity or other person under the terms of any
composition or arrangement with any creditor of any person (other than the relevant recipient of any Parent
Payment Obligation and the Receivable relating thereto); (c) any failure to realize the full value of any security;
(d) any incapacity or lack of power, authority or legal personality of a Buyer Entity or any other person; (e) any
amendment, novation, supplement or restatement (however fundamental) or replacement of the APMSA or any
other documents; (f) any unenforceability, illegality or invalidity or any obligation of any person under the
APMSA; or (g) any insolvency or similar proceedings. Each Buyer Entity also waives any right it may have of
first requiring the Platform Provider to proceed against or enforce any other rights or security or claim from any
person before claiming from them pursuant to the APMSA, regardless of any applicable law or provision to the
contrary. The Buyer Entities further agree to refrain from exercising any of the following rights which they may
have under the APMSA until all amounts which may be or become payable by a Buyer Entity in connection with
the APMSA have been irrevocably paid in full: (a) to be indemnified by any other Buyer Entity; (b) to claim
contribution from any other guarantor of any Buyer Entity’s obligations under the APMSA; (c) to take the benefit
of any rights of the Platform Provider or a transferee under the APMSA in respect of the Buyer Entities; (d) to
bring legal or other proceedings for an order requiring any Buyer Entity to make any payment or perform any
other obligation in respect of which any Buyer Entity has given an undertaking or indemnity under the provisions
of the APMSA; (e) to exercise any right of set-off against any Buyer Entity; and/or (f) to claim or prove as a
creditor of any Buyer Entity in competition with the Platform Provider or a transferee.

The Buyer Parent has notified the Platform Provider in writing that Eligible Platform Receivables (as
defined below) may include those with a Confirmed Payment Date of up to 360 days from the issuance date of
the relevant invoice. In respect of Initial Transfers of such Receivables, a margin of 2.20% per annum calculated
on the basis of the relevant Outstanding Amounts (which includes the Platform Provider Processing Fee) over the
base rate (the “Margin”) shall be applied from the date of the relevant Initial Transfer until the Confirmed
Payment Date in respect of such Payment Obligation (and the Receivable related thereto, solely to the extent that
such Receivable has been acquired by the Platform Provider). The base rate (being, in this case, EURIBOR with
a floor of zero) is determined by the remaining tenor between the date of the relevant transfer and the Confirmed
Payment Date (i.e. between 1 and 30 days, 1 month base rate will apply; between 31 and 60 days, 2 months base
rate will apply). The applicable base rate plus the applicable Margin are used to calculate the Applied Discount
that the Platform Provider will deduct from the Certified Amount in the case of transfer by the Platform Provider
of the VFZ Account Receivable prior to the Confirmed Payment Date, and accordingly is used in the calculation
of the Purchase Price Amount for each VFZ Account Receivable. The Margin under the APMSA may not be
amended without the written consent of the Issuer, and pursuant to the terms of the other Transaction Documents,
the Issuer will agree to provide its written consent to any amendment of the Margin (without being required to
seek the consent of the Noteholders) so long as the obligations of the New VFZ Facilities Borrower in favour of
the Issuer under Clause 11.2 (“Facility Fees”) of the New VFZ Facilities Agreement remain in full force and
effect.

Pursuant to the APMSA, the Buyer Parent and, as applicable, each Obligor Subsidiary appoints the Platform
Provider as paying agent with respect to the settlement of any VFZ Account Receivable. Settlement requires the
Buyer Parent (or, at its option, an Obligor Subsidiary) to make an electronic transfer of the Certified Amount to
the Platform Provider’s designated bank account on the Confirmed Payment Date, and the Platform Provider
will, in turn, transfer such Certified Amount (or part thereof as received by the Platform Provider) to the relevant
recipient (which shall be the Issuer in respect of Assigned Receivables) on the same Confirmed Payment Date.
Failure by any Obligor to pay all or any part of the Certified Amount by the Confirmed Payment Date will cause
default interest to accrue on the unpaid sum at a rate of 1-month EURIBOR (floored at zero) plus 7% per annum,
until the Certified Amount has been discharged in full.

If a Buyer Entity wishes to reduce the amount of any Approved Platform Receivable for any reason
(including as a result of any lien, right of set-off, defence, claim, counterclaim, or other certain adverse claim), it

128


-----

may post the amount to be deducted from such Approved Platform Receivable (each, a “Credit Note”) as an
entry in an Electronic Data File to the SCF Platform Website and such Credit Note will be allocated to the
corresponding Payment Obligation on the following Business Day. No Credit Notes may be allocated to a
Payment Obligation following the relevant Certified Amount Fixed Date; however, such Credit Note will be
allocated to a Payment Obligation which has not yet been transferred through the SCF Platform in accordance
with the terms of the APMSA. Additionally, each Buyer Entity agrees to be responsible for the accuracy of all
information submitted by them onto the SCF Platform Website in respect of VFZ Accounts Receivable and the
Buyer Parent agrees to comply with certain reporting requirements set out in the APMSA.

Under the APMSA, each Buyer Entity represents, warrants and covenants to the Platform Provider at the
date of an Upload resulting in any Payment Obligation arising and at the date of any transfer via the SCF
Platform of a Payment Obligation and the Receivable related thereto (solely to the extent that such Receivable
has been acquired by the Platform Provider) (including each Assignment Date), as applicable, among other
things: (i) that the Approved Platform Receivable relating to each Payment Obligation meets certain criteria
under the APMSA: that it is a debt owed by the relevant Buyer Entity to a Supplier permitted to access the SCF
Platform Website pursuant to the terms of the APMSA, has a Confirmed Payment Date of no more than 360 days
from the issuance date of the relevant invoice, and is denominated in one of EUR, USD, or such other currency
as agreed between the Platform Provider, the Buyer Parent and the relevant Supplier (each such Approved
Platform Receivable, an “Eligible Platform Receivable”); (ii) that the Approved Platform Receivable is not
subject to any mortgage, charge, pledge, lien, other encumbrance or other personal right or right in rem of any
third party and has, to the best of the relevant Buyer Entity’s knowledge, not been transferred or transferred in
advance; (iii) that each Payment Obligation and the Receivable related thereto (solely to the extent that such
Receivable has been acquired by the Platform Provider) is free of any adverse claims, including any lien, right of
set-off, netting, abatement, reduction, claim, defence or counterclaim; (iv) that each Payment Obligation and
Receivable related thereto (solely to the extent that such Receivable has been acquired by the Platform Provider)
can be validly transferred in accordance with the terms of the APMSA; and (v) that each Payment Obligation will
be settled by an Obligor by the payment of the relevant Certified Amount on the relevant Confirmed Payment
Date without withholding, deduction or set-off.

The APMSA also provides that the following occurrences, among others, constitute events of default,
whereupon the Platform Provider shall have the right (but not the obligation) to suspend the provision of
accounts payable management services and prohibit the creation of any further Payment Obligations (each, an
“APMSA Event of Default”): (i) breach by any Buyer Entity of any obligation or certain representations,
warranties, covenants, or any other obligations in the APMSA, if not remedied for a period of ten days (which
grace period shall not apply if such breach relates to a financial interest of an amount in excess of €5.0 million);
(ii) non-payment of any amount due under the APMSA, including all or any part of any Certified Amount
(subject to a grace period of one Business Day in the case of principal, and three Business Days in the case of any
other amount); (iii) if any Buyer Entity is unable, deemed unable, or admits inability to pay its debts as they fall
due or is declared to be unable to pay its debts in applicable law; and (iv) any corporate action, legal proceedings
or other procedure or step is taken in relation to the suspension of payments, winding-up, or dissolution of any
Buyer Entity, or any composition, compromise, assignment or arrangement with any creditor of any Buyer
Entity, or the appointment of a liquidator, receiver, or other similar officer in respect of any Buyer Entity.

The Buyer Parent has also agreed to provide certain indemnities to the Platform Provider under the APMSA,
including (but not limited to) indemnities against any losses directly suffered for or on account of tax, reasonable
losses incurred as a direct result of any APMSA Event of Default or failure by any Buyer Entity to pay any
amount due under the APMSA, and any costs, expenses, claims or losses incurred as a result of the incorrect
calculation by any Buyer Entity of the amount of any Receivable uploaded in an Electronic Data File.

The Platform Provider may assign, transfer or deal in any other manner with any VFZ Account Receivable
that has been transferred to it, and/or all of its rights against any Buyer Entity or under the APMSA, in part or in
whole, to any third party. No Buyer Entity may so assign or transfer its respective rights and obligations under
the APMSA without the written consent of the Platform Provider, and such consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

Each of the Platform Provider and the Buyer Parent may unilaterally terminate the APMSA upon notice to
the other party, if such other party breaches a material provision of the APMSA and fails to cure such breach
within 10 days following written notice from the other party requiring them to remedy such breach. The Platform
Provider may also terminate the APMSA: (i) for any reason upon 12 months’ prior written notice to the Buyer
Parent; and (ii) immediately, upon written notice, if it becomes unlawful for the Platform Provider in any

129


-----

applicable jurisdiction to perform any of its obligations thereunder. The Buyer Parent may terminate the APMSA
for any reason upon 20 Business Days’ prior written notice to the Platform Provider. Following termination of
the APMSA, the Buyer Entities will no longer be permitted to use to the SCF Platform. All rights, duties and
obligations of the parties to the APMSA with respect to the Payment Obligations posted to the SCF Platform
prior to the effective date of any termination shall survive the termination of the APMSA.

The Accounts Payable Management Services Agreement is governed by English law.

**Discounted Payments Purchase Agreements**

In conjunction with the SCF Platform, each Supplier has entered into, or will enter into, a Discounted
Payments Purchase Agreement (each based on a standard form) with the Platform Provider. Each Supplier has
also entered into a separate electronic agreement (each, a “Supplier Platform Access Agreement”) with the
Platform Provider, pursuant to which the Platform Provider has granted the relevant Supplier access to the SCF
Platform on the terms and conditions set out therein.

Upon an Upload by a Buyer Entity and the designation of such uploaded Receivable as “approved”, (i) the
price of such Receivable is increased (in accordance with the relevant supply contract, including any supplement
thereto) by adding to the initial face value of such Receivable the Applied Discount (as defined in the context of
the APMSA) (as displayed on the SCF Platform on the relevant day) calculated for the period between the date of
the Upload and the Confirmed Payment Date; and (ii) the Supplier to which such Approved Platform Receivable
relates will automatically and irrevocably offer to sell to the Platform Provider the relevant Parent Payment
Obligation and the Receivable related thereto at a discounted price (the “Net Purchase Amount”) (as determined
by deducting from the grossed-up amount of the relevant invoice (calculated in accordance with the relevant
supply contract, including any supplement thereto, as described above), such Applied Discount (as defined in the
APMSA) (as displayed on the SCF Platform on the relevant day), such that the Platform Provider pays an amount
equal to the original face value of such invoice owed to the Supplier). Upon making such irrevocable offer, the
Supplier agrees not to sell, offer to sell, transfer, pledge or offer as security to any other person, or consent to any
other lien on, any Receivable that relates to the relevant Parent Payment Obligation. The Platform Provider may,
at its sole discretion, elect to either accept or decline to purchase the relevant Parent Payment Obligation and the
Receivable related thereto by posting such acceptance or rejection on the SCF Platform in accordance with the
terms of the relevant Discounted Payments Purchase Agreement. If the Platform Provider accepts such offer, it
shall cause the Net Purchase Amount to be paid to the relevant Supplier bank account on the same Business Day
(if the acceptance takes place before 11:30AM CET) or the following Business Day (if the acceptance takes place
after 11:30AM CET). Each such offer accepted by the Platform Provider pursuant to a Discounted Payments
Purchase Agreement will result in the sale, assignment and transfer to the Platform Provider of all of such
Supplier’s rights, title and interest in and to the relevant Parent Payment Obligation and the Receivable related
thereto, without any further action or documentation on the part of the Supplier, the relevant Buyer Entity or the
Platform Provider being required.

The Supplier is deemed to represent and warrant to the Platform Provider upon the date of each offer (and
the date of the relevant Initial Transfer) that, with respect to each Parent Payment Obligation (and any Receivable
related thereto, where applicable), among other things: (i) the Supplier (solely) holds the full legal and beneficial
right, title and interest in and to the relevant Parent Payment Obligation and the Receivable related thereto;
(ii) the Supplier is entitled to sell and transfer the relevant Parent Payment Obligation and the Receivable related
thereto to the Platform Provider pursuant to the terms of the relevant Discounted Payments Purchase Agreement,
and the relevant Parent Payment Obligation and the Receivable related thereto is transferred to the Platform
Provider following acceptance of the offer; (iii) no mortgage, charge, pledge, lien, other encumbrance or other
personal right or right in rem exists in relation to the relevant Parent Payment Obligation or Receivable related
thereto, and the relevant Parent Payment Obligation has not been transferred nor made subject to any mortgage,
charge, pledge, lien, or other encumbrance in advance; and (iv) the Parent Payment Obligation and the
Receivable related thereto is free of any adverse claims, including any lien, right of set-off, netting, abatement,
reduction, claim, defence or counterclaim. Following each Initial Transfer, the Platform Provider, in its capacity
as agent for the relevant Supplier, shall provide notice of such transfer to the Buyer Parent and the relevant Buyer
Subsidiary.

Additionally, pursuant to the relevant Discounted Payments Purchase Agreement, any tax applicable to the
transfer from the Supplier to the Platform Provider of a Parent Payment Obligation and any Receivable related
thereto shall be solely payable by that Supplier. The Supplier also represents and warrants that upon payment by
the Platform Provider of the outstanding amount owing under any Parent Payment Obligation to the relevant

130


-----

bank account established in such Supplier’s own name on the Confirmed Payment Date, the applicable Parent
Payment Obligation shall be satisfied and the relevant Buyer Entity’s obligation to pay the Supplier for the
corresponding Receivable shall be extinguished in an amount equal to such amount paid.

Each Discounted Payments Purchase Agreement provides that the Platform Provider shall not be liable to
the Supplier for any of the following: (a) any improper use of the SCF Platform Website, or the security devices,
by any authorized users or by any unauthorized persons; (b) any loss suffered by the Supplier as a result of any
reliance on the content of the SCF Platform Website or any other information submitted onto the SCF Platform
or derived from it; and (iii) any loss or damage arising out of, or in consequence of, any failure by the Supplier to
comply with any provisions of the relevant Supplier Platform Access Agreement. Each Supplier further provides
a disclaimer acknowledging that it has not relied on any representation of the Platform Provider in relation to the
accounting treatment to be applied to the transactions contemplated by the relevant Discounted Payments
Purchase Agreement.

Subject to the agreement of the relevant Suppliers to the standard form, each Discounted Payments Purchase
Agreement gives the Platform Provider the right, without the consent of or notice to the Supplier, to assign,
transfer, mortgage, charge or otherwise deal in any other manner with any or all of its rights and obligations
under the relevant Discounted Payments Purchase Agreement, in whole or in part (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any of the Parent Payment Obligations and Receivables related thereto purchased by the Platform Provider
thereunder). In turn, pursuant to the Framework Assignment Agreement (as described above), the Platform
Provider’s right, title and interest in and to the whole of each VFZ Account Receivable are assigned to the Issuer.
No Supplier shall assign, transfer, mortgage, charge or otherwise deal in any other manner with any or all of its
rights and obligations under the relevant Discounted Payments Purchase Agreement (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any of the Payment Obligations and Receivables related thereto purchased by the Platform Provider
thereunder) without the written consent of the Platform Provider. Any amendment or waiver of any provision of
the Discounted Payments Purchase Agreement shall only be with the consent of each of the Supplier and the
Platform Provider.

The Platform Provider may terminate any Discounted Payments Purchase Agreement upon twelve
(12) months’ notice in writing to the Supplier. The Platform Provider may also terminate any Discounted
Payments Purchase Agreement upon written notice immediately if it becomes unlawful for the Platform Provider
in any applicable jurisdiction to perform any of its obligations under such agreement. Any Supplier may
terminate the relevant Discounted Payments Purchase Agreement upon two Business Days’ advance written
notice to the Platform Provider. Upon termination of any Supplier Platform Access Agreement, the
corresponding Discounted Payments Purchase Agreement shall automatically terminate. Upon termination of any
Discounted Payments Purchase Agreement, the Supplier shall not offer for sale to the Platform Provider, and the
Platform Provider shall not purchase, any additional Payment Obligations (or any Receivables relating thereto).
All amounts due to the Platform Provider under any previously transferred Payment Obligations shall remain in
full force and effect, and all rights, duties and obligations of the parties with respect to the Payment Obligations
posted onto the SCF Platform prior to the effective date of any termination shall survive such termination.

The Discounted Payments Purchase Agreements are governed by English law.

as profit to be paid to the Foundation (the “Subscriber Profit”) in return for the Foundation procuring that the
Issuer enters into certain Transaction Documents or amendments thereto on or prior to the Issue Date, and (ii) in
consideration for the Issuer agreeing to enter into Transaction Documents and the payment by the New VFZ

Capitalization Amount (the “Issue Date Shares”) credited as fully paid (together, the “Issue Date
**Arrangements”). None of the Issuer, the Foundation or the New VFZ Facilities Borrower will be obliged to**
satisfy their respective obligations under the Issue Date Arrangements Agreement unless the Issue Date
Arrangements are completed simultaneously and the Conditions to Completion (as defined below) have been

off all payments due by each of the Issuer, the Foundation and the New VFZ Facilities Borrower in connection
with the Issue Date Arrangements and the funding of the Issue Date Facility Loan.

Completion of the subscription for the Issue Date Shares, if any, by the Foundation will be dependent upon
the following conditions (the “Conditions to Completion”) having been satisfied: (i) the Foundation, in its
capacity as the existing shareholder and holder of the Existing Shares, having caused a resolution by it to be
passed to issue the Issue Date Shares in accordance with the terms of the Issue Date Arrangements Agreement;
and (ii) each of the Issuer, the Foundation and the New VFZ Facilities Borrower having entered into each
Transaction Document to which it is party on the Issue Date. Upon satisfaction of the Conditions to Completion
and the subscription by the Foundation for the Issue Date Shares, the Issuer shall, inter alia, enter into the
applicable Transaction Documents and deliver certain documents (including copies of the resolutions required,
and minutes of the board meeting held, pursuant to the Conditions to Completion) to the Foundation.

holder of the Existing Shares) will each represent and warrant to the Foundation (in its capacity as subscriber
formed under the laws of the Netherlands of the Issue Date Shares) that, inter alia: (i) following the Foundation’s
subscription for the Issue Date Shares, the Shares comprise the whole of the allotted and issued share capital of
the Issuer; (ii) save for any agreement to the contrary described in the Transaction Documents (including the
Issue Date Arrangements agreed to in the Issue Date Arrangements Agreement), there is no Encumbrance (as
defined in the Issue Date Arrangements Agreement) nor any agreement, arrangement or obligation to create or
give any Encumbrance affecting any of the Shares or any of the issued or unissued shares of the Issuer, nor any
agreement, arrangement or obligation in force which calls for the present or future allotment, issue or transfer of
any share or loan capital of the Issuer, and no share or loan capital has been created, allotted, issued, acquired,
repaid or redeemed by the Issuer; (iii) the Shares are fully paid up or credited as fully paid up; and (iv) the
execution or performance of the Issue Date Arrangements Agreement and all other applicable Transaction
Documents will not give rise to, or cause to become exercisable, any right of pre-emption over the Issue Date
Shares, will not entitle any person to receive from the Issuer any finder’s fee, brokerage or other commission in

**TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE NOTES**

_The following are the terms and conditions of the Notes in the form (subject to completion and amendment)_
_in which they will be set out in the Trust Deed. These terms and conditions include summaries of, and are subject_
_to, the detailed provisions of the Trust Deed, and the Agency and Account Bank Agreement and the other_
_Transaction Documents (each as defined below)._

The €400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of % Vendor Financing Notes due 2024 (the
“Notes”) of VZ Vendor Financing B.V. (the “Issuer”) are constituted by a trust deed (as amended, amended and
restated, novated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Trust Deed”) to be dated
2019 (the “Issue Date”) between, among others, the Issuer, BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services
Limited (in this capacity, together with any successor, substitute or replacement the “Notes Trustee”) as trustee
for the holders of the time being of the Notes (the “Noteholders”) and security trustee (in this capacity, together
with any successor, substitute or replacement, the “Security Trustee”) as security trustee for the Secured Parties.
The Notes Trustee will not accede to the Group Priority Agreement or the Holdco Priority Agreement and the
Noteholders will not be bound by the terms of these intercreditor arrangements.

The expression “Notes” shall in these Conditions, unless the context otherwise requires, include the Notes
offered hereby as well as any Further Notes (as defined below) issued pursuant to Condition 20 (Issue of Further
_Notes). Any Further Notes which are issued shall form a single class with the Notes issued on the Issue Date then_
outstanding. The Notes are subject to these terms and conditions (the “Conditions”).

**Overview of the Structure of the Offering of the Notes**

As part of the Transactions, the Issuer intends to issue €400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the
Notes. As more fully described below, the proceeds from the offering of the Notes will be used to purchase
eligible payment obligations and accounts receivable relating thereto owing by VodafoneZiggo and certain of its
subsidiaries, to make certain loans available to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower and for the other purposes
described herein. Defined terms used but not defined herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the
“Definitions” section.

In the course of their business, VodafoneZiggo and its subsidiaries purchase goods and/or services from
suppliers pursuant to the terms of various supply contracts, and those suppliers issue invoices requiring the
relevant Buyer Entity (as defined below) to make payment for the purchase of such goods and/or services on the
terms specified in the applicable invoice and supply contract. Each invoice evidences an amount payable by a
Buyer Entity to a Supplier (as defined below) as a result of an existing business relationship and includes all
rights attaching thereto under the relevant contract to which such invoice relates and the SCF Platform
Documents (as defined below) (as defined and further described in “Description of the Receivables” included
elsewhere in this Offering Circular, each, a “Receivable” and collectively, the “Receivables”). From time to
time, a Buyer Entity may upload an Electronic Data File containing details of Receivables payable to a Supplier
(as defined in Condition 1 (Definitions and Principles of Construction)) on to the SCF Platform (as defined
below) (an “Upload”). The designation of such uploaded Receivables as “approved” by a Buyer Entity (an
“Approved Platform Receivable”) will initially give rise to an independent and primary obligation by
VodafoneZiggo to make payment or cause payment to be made to the Relevant Recipient on the Confirmed
Payment Date (as defined below) in respect of such Approved Platform Receivable (a “Parent Payment
**Obligation”). As permitted in accordance with the terms pursuant to which the relevant assets were acquired**
and/or services supplied, the relevant Buyer Entity will specify, in such Electronic Data File, the date on which
such Parent Payment Obligation and the related Receivable will be paid (which date will be either the original
invoice date or a date up to 360 days from the original invoice date, each, a “Confirmed Payment Date”).

As part of its participation in the SCF Platform, each Supplier has agreed that it will offer to sell Parent
Payment Obligations and the related Receivables to the Platform Provider (as defined in Condition 1 (Definitions
_and Principles of Construction)). In such cases, the Platform Provider may purchase the relevant Parent Payment_
Obligation and such related Receivable from the Supplier at a price intended to be equal to the original face value
of the invoice owed to the Supplier (as further described below under “SCF Platform Documents—Discounted
_Payments Purchase Agreements”)._

Upon each sale and assignment of a Parent Payment Obligation and the related Receivable from the
Supplier to the Platform Provider through the SCF Platform (each, an “Initial Transfer”), each Obligor will
become jointly and severally liable with each other Obligor to make payment or cause payment to be made to the

141


-----

Relevant Recipient on the Confirmed Payment Date in respect of such Parent Payment Obligation (such Parent
Payment Obligation, as enhanced by the joint and several payment undertaking of each Obligor, a “Payment
**Obligation”). Pursuant to the Framework Assignment Agreement (as defined below), the Platform Provider may**
subsequently offer to sell and assign to the Issuer, on a non-recourse basis, eligible Payment Obligations and the
related Receivables (solely to the extent that such Receivables have been acquired by the Platform Provider)
(collectively and as further described and defined below, the “VFZ Accounts Receivable”).

On or about the Issue Date, the Issuer will use the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes plus any
upfront payment payable by the New VFZ Facilities Borrower under the New VFZ Facilities Agreement (as
defined below) to finance the purchase of eligible VFZ Accounts Receivable pursuant to the terms and conditions
of the Framework Assignment Agreement. To the extent that such proceeds from the offering of the Notes
exceed the amount of VFZ Accounts Receivable available for purchase by the Issuer on the first Value Date (as
defined below) falling on or after the Issue Date, the Issuer will advance any such excess proceeds to the New
VFZ Facilities Borrower as a revolving loan under the New VFZ Facilities Agreement (an “Excess Cash Loan”,
and collectively with other loans advanced under the Excess Cash Facility (as defined below) from time to time,
the “Excess Cash Loans”).

Following the Issue Date, as VFZ Accounts Receivable purchased by the Issuer (the “Assigned
**Receivables”) are settled on their respective Confirmed Payment Dates (as defined below), the Platform Provider**
(acting as collection agent for the Issuer under the Framework Assignment Agreement) will receive an amount
from the relevant Obligor (a “Collected Amount”) towards repayment of an amount equal to the Outstanding
Amount (as defined below) relating to such Assigned Receivables. The Issuer will use the Collected Amount,
_less the portion of such Collected Amount comprising Premium (as defined below) (each such difference, a_
“Collected Principal Amount”), to purchase (through the Platform Provider) new VFZ Accounts Receivable, to
the extent available for purchase, or to advance such funds to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower as additional
Excess Cash Loans. Excess Cash Loans will bear a rate of interest of %. The rate of interest on the
Excess Cash Loans, together with the interest earned on the Issue Date Facility Loans (as defined below) under
the Issue Date Facility (as defined below), is intended to provide the Issuer with the same rate of return in respect
of the Committed Principal Proceeds (as defined below) not invested in VFZ Accounts Receivable (including any
Retained Collected Amount (as defined below)) as Noteholders will receive in respect of the Notes. Interest on
the Excess Cash Loans and the Issue Date Facility Loans will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
comprising twelve 30-day months. From time to time, as further VFZ Accounts Receivable become available for
purchase through the SCF Platform, the Issuer will, directly or indirectly, fund such purchases with Collected
Principal Amounts and any Purchase Price Return Amounts (as defined below) which are expected to be credited
to the Issuer on the relevant Value Date (such amounts, collectively, “Interim Platform Amounts”), and to the
extent such purchases cannot be fully funded by Interim Platform Amounts, by demanding from the New VFZ
Facilities Borrower, on a weekly basis, repayment of a principal amount of Excess Cash Loans then outstanding
equal to such shortfall.

The primary sources of payment of interest on the Notes will be:

1. the premium earned by the Issuer on Assigned Receivables (the “Premium”), being an amount equal
to the difference between (i) the Outstanding Amounts (as further defined and described below under
“Purchases and Collections of VFZ Accounts Receivable—The Framework Assignment Agreement”)
collected upon maturity thereof, less (ii) the Purchase Price Amounts (as further defined and described
below under “Purchases and Collections of VFZ Accounts Receivable—The Framework Assignment
_Agreement”) at which such Assigned Receivables are initially purchased by the Issuer; and_

2. the interest earned by the Issuer on Excess Cash Loans and the Issue Date Facility Loans made to the
New VFZ Facilities Borrower under the New VFZ Facilities Agreement (the “VFZ Facilities
**Interest”).**

Additionally, the Issuer may, from time to time, receive interest paid by the Platform Provider on
(i) Retained Collected Amounts (being Collected Amounts which have not been paid to the Issuer towards
satisfaction of the relevant Outstanding Amount and not been used to purchase further VFZ Accounts
Receivable) (such interest, the “Retained Collected Amount Interest”); (ii) Excess Requested Purchase Price
Amounts (as defined below), being funds transferred to the Platform Provider which have not been applied
towards the purchase of new VFZ Accounts Receivables on the relevant Value Date (such interest, the “Excess
**Requested Purchase Price Interest”); and (iii) funds exceeding the Requested Purchase Price Amount**
Aggregate Limit (as defined below) of €50.0 million (such excess, the “Aggregate Amount Excess”,
collectively with the Excess Requested Purchase Price Amounts and Unutilised Collected Amounts (as defined

142


-----

below), the “Purchase Price Return Amounts”), and which have not been repaid to the Issuer in accordance
with the timeframe set out in the Framework Assignment Agreement (such interest, as further defined and
described below, the “Delayed Aggregate Amount Interest”, collectively with the Retained Collected Amount
Interest and the Excess Requested Purchase Price Interest, the “Retained Amount Interest”). The Retained
Amount Interest will be calculated in accordance with the Framework Assignment Agreement (as described
below) and the Agency and Account Bank Agreement (as described elsewhere in this Offering Circular), and will
be deemed to accrue on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

The Premium, the VFZ Facilities Interest and the Retained Amount Interest are, collectively, the “Interest
**Proceeds”. To the extent the Interest Proceeds earned during an interest payment period are insufficient to fund**
scheduled payments of interest on the Notes, the deficiency will be made up by the New VFZ Facilities Borrower
via a Shortfall Payment (as defined below) to be paid to the Issuer.

The primary sources of repayment of principal on the Notes, on the Maturity Date or at early redemption of
the Notes in accordance with the Conditions, will be:

1. the Collected Principal Amounts repaid in respect of Assigned Receivables at their respective
maturities; and

2. repayments of Excess Cash Loans and (with respect to repayment of principal on the Maturity Date of
the Notes or at early redemption of the Notes in accordance with the Conditions) Issue Date Facility
Loans.

Additionally, the Issuer may, from time to time, receive repayments from the Platform Provider of Purchase
Price Return Amounts (if any), which will be applied towards repayment of principal on the Notes on the
Maturity Date or at early redemption of the Notes in accordance with the Conditions.

Whether in respect of settlement of Assigned Receivables, repayment of loans advanced under the New
VFZ Facilities Agreement or funding of any Shortfall Payment, among other payment obligations, the Issuer will
ultimately be reliant on funds from the New VFZ Facilities Borrower and certain of its subsidiaries to make
payments due under the Notes.

In connection with the Transactions, the Issuer will enter into the following agreements, among others:

1. the Framework Assignment Agreement, pursuant to which the Issuer will periodically use any Excess
Cash to purchase available VFZ Accounts Receivable. References to “Excess Cash” are to uninvested
funds in an amount equal to (i) the Committed Principal Proceeds, minus (ii) the Requested Purchase
Price Amounts paid by the Issuer (taking into account any Interim Platform Amount) for any Assigned
Receivables outstanding as of the relevant determination date;

2. the New VFZ Facilities Agreement, pursuant to which the Issuer will (i) make loans (each, an
“Interest Facility Loan” and collectively, the “Interest Facility Loans”) to the New VFZ Facilities
Borrower under the Interest Facility (as defined below), (ii) to the extent that VFZ Accounts
Receivable are not available for purchase through the SCF Platform, use Excess Cash to make Excess
Cash Loans to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower under the Excess Cash Facility, (iii) make any Issue
Date Facility Loans to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower under the Issue Date Facility, and (iv) make
certain payments to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower (including any Excess Arrangement Payment (as
defined below)), and pursuant to which the New VFZ Facilities Borrower will make certain payments
to the Issuer (including any Shortfall Payment);

3. the Expenses Agreement, pursuant to which the Issuer will be entitled to (i) receive reimbursement
from the New VFZ Facilities Borrower in respect of certain fees and expenses of the Issuer, including
certain fees and expenses in relation to the issuance of the Notes, and (ii) receive certain payments
from the New VFZ Facilities Borrower in respect of amounts that may become due and payable in
respect of the Notes, including certain fees and expenses in relation to the issuance of the Notes, certain
tax liabilities of the Issuer, any Additional Amounts (as defined in the section titled “Terms and
_Conditions of the Notes”), any premiums on redemption of the Notes, and any interest on overdue_
amounts under the Notes; and

4. the Agency and Account Bank Agreement, pursuant to which The Bank of New York Mellon, London
Branch as administrator will agree, among other things, to provide certain portfolio administration and
calculation services to and/or on behalf of the Issuer.

denominated in euros; (iv) (with respect to the Payment Obligation component of such VFZ Account Receivable
only) is the legal, valid and binding obligation of each Obligor; (v) is capable of being freely and validly transferred
in the manner provided by the Framework Assignment Agreement, so that on purchase the Issuer will receive good
title; (vi) is due and payable in full without any right of set-off, counterclaim or deduction in favour of the Buyer
Entities; and (vii) has a maturity date that is no later than two Business Days prior to the Maturity Date of the Notes.
For a further description of the VFZ Accounts Receivable, see “Description of the Receivables” included elsewhere
in this Offering Circular. Additionally, immediately prior to each Assignment Date, the Platform Provider will
represent and warrant that it is entitled to assign the relevant Payment Obligation pursuant to the terms of the
Framework Assignment Agreement, and that it has not assigned, transferred or otherwise disposed of, or created
any encumbrance or security interest over, such Payment Obligation. Furthermore, the Platform Provider will
undertake that it will not, without the consent of the Issuer, take any action that would adversely affect a Payment
Obligation or the Issuer’s interest(s) therein (as further described in “Summary of Principal Documents—
_Framework Assignment Agreement” included elsewhere in this Offering Circular)._

Each Payment Obligation will be the joint and several obligation of the New VFZ Facilities Borrower and
each of the New VFZ Facilities Obligors (as defined below). On the Issue Date, the eligible Obligors will be
VodafoneZiggo and VZ Financing II B.V. (each, a “New VFZ Facilities Obligor” and collectively, the “New
**VFZ Facilities Obligors”, and together with the New VFZ Facilities Borrower, the “Obligors”).**

_Purchases of VFZ Accounts Receivable with Requested Purchase Price Amounts_

On or following the Issue Date (as further described in “Capitalization of VodafoneZiggo” included
elsewhere in this Offering Circular), the Platform Provider is expected to sell and assign to the Issuer VFZ

145


-----

Accounts Receivable for a Requested Purchase Price Amount of €400.0 million, which the Issuer will fund with
all or a portion of the Committed Principal Proceeds. See “Use of Proceeds”. It is expected that the Issuer will
complete its initial purchases of new and existing VFZ Accounts Receivable by 31 March 2020. In connection
with such sale and assignment, the Platform Provider will deliver to the Issuer:

1. an assignment framework note (substantially in the form attached to the Framework Assignment
Agreement, an “Assignment Framework Note”) to be accepted and agreed to by the Issuer, pursuant
to which the Issuer will agree, among other things, to purchase Payment Obligations (and the
Receivables related thereto, solely to the extent that such Receivables have been acquired by the
Platform Provider), in whole but not in part, at the relevant Purchase Price Amounts in an aggregate
amount equal to a limit (in respect of purchased Payment Obligations which have not been settled)
specified therein (the “Purchase Limit”); and

2. one or more notices related to such Assignment Framework Note (substantially in the form attached to
the Framework Assignment Agreement, each an “Assignment Notice”) instructing the Issuer to pay to
the Platform Provider, as consideration for the sale and assignment of the relevant VFZ Accounts
Receivable, a requested amount (a “Requested Purchase Price Amount”) on the date falling five
Business Days following receipt by the Issuer of such Assignment Notice (a “Value Date”).

As used herein, a “Purchase Price Amount” means, in relation to any VFZ Account Receivable, an amount
equal to the Outstanding Amount (as defined below) of such VFZ Account Receivable less the Applied Discount
(as defined in the context of the Framework Assignment Agreement) (as defined below) calculated as at the
relevant Assignment Date. “Outstanding Amount” means, with respect to a Payment Obligation, an amount
equal to (i) the gross amount of the Approved Platform Receivable in respect of which the Payment Obligation
arose, less (ii) the sum of all Credit Notes (as defined below under “SCF Platform Documents—Accounts
_Payable Management Services Agreement”) allocated to that Payment Obligation pursuant to the terms of the_
APMSA. “Applied Discount” refers (i) in the context of the APMSA, to the discount amount that the Platform
Provider will deduct from the Certified Amount (as defined below under “SCF Platform Documents—Accounts
_Payable Management Services Agreement”) in case of a transfer of the Payment Obligation prior to the_
Confirmed Payment Date pursuant to the terms of the APMSA and each relevant Discounted Payments Purchase
Agreement and (ii) in the context of the Framework Assignment Agreement, to the discount amount that the
Platform Provider will deduct from the Certified Amount in the case of a transfer of the Payment Obligation prior
to the Confirmed Payment Date pursuant to the terms of the APMSA and each relevant Discounted Payments
Purchase Agreement, less the processing fee due to the Platform Provider specified in the APMSA (which will
initially be 0.20%) (the “Platform Provider Processing Fee”).

From time to time following the Issue Date, the Platform Provider may, at its discretion (but not more than
once per week prior to the service of a notice of termination (as further described below)) and to the extent that the
Requested Purchase Price Amount specified in such Assignment Notice together with all other outstanding
Requested Purchase Price Amounts which have not been applied towards the purchase of VFZ Accounts Receivable
would not exceed €50.0 million at such time (the “Requested Purchase Price Amount Aggregate Limit”), serve
further Assignment Notices (which may also be Primary Assignment Notices (as defined and further described
below under “—Collections on Assigned Receivables and Further Purchases of VFZ Accounts Receivable with
_Collected Principal Amounts”)) to the Issuer pursuant to the relevant Assignment Framework Note._

Following the receipt of an Assignment Notice, so long as no Non-Compliance Event (as defined below) has
occurred and is continuing, the Issuer will pay, on the relevant Value Date, the relevant Requested Purchase Price
Amount (which may be adjusted as further described below) to the Platform Provider, which shall have the effect of
the Platform Provider immediately selling and assigning, without further action on the part of any person or entity,
all of its rights, title and interest in and to the relevant Payment Obligations (and the Receivables related thereto,
solely to the extent that such Receivables have been acquired by the Platform Provider) at the relevant Purchase
Price Amounts to the Issuer pursuant to the relevant Assignment Framework Note (an “Assignment”). The
Requested Purchase Price Amount (and the corresponding VFZ Accounts Receivable) will be adjusted if the
aggregate of all Requested Purchase Price Amounts, together with (without double counting) the aggregate of all
Purchase Price Amounts in respect of outstanding Assigned Receivables would be higher than the relevant Purchase
Limit specified in that Assignment Framework Note. In such event, the Issuer must notify the Platform Provider
within two Business Days of receipt of the relevant Assignment Notice (i) of such circumstance and (ii) that the
Requested Purchase Price Amount will (A) be reduced to equal the amount which would cause the aggregate
Requested Purchase Price Amount, together with (without double counting) the aggregate of all Purchase Price
Amounts in respect of outstanding Assigned Receivables to equal such Purchase Limit and/or (B) cancelled to the
extent necessary such that the relevant assignment is for the whole, and not part, of the VFZ Accounts Receivable.

146


-----

The Issuer will not be obliged to pay a Requested Purchase Price Amount specified in an Assignment Notice if
any of the following events (each, a “Non-Compliance Event”) have occurred and is continuing (provided that the
Issuer notifies the Platform Provider, within two Business Days of the receipt of such Assignment Notice, that one
or more Non-Compliance Events have occurred and of the Issuer’s intention not to comply with such Assignment
Notice): (i) if the Framework Assignment Agreement or relevant Assignment Framework Note has been terminated
prior to the date of such Assignment Notice; (ii) if the terms and conditions of such Assignment Notice materially
deviate from the terms and conditions of the Framework Assignment Agreement or the relevant Assignment
Framework Note; (iii) if an Obligor Event of Default (as defined below) is continuing in respect of any Obligor;
and/or (iv) if a specified insolvency event occurs in respect of the Platform Provider which directly results in the
Platform Provider not continuing its business as contemplated under the Framework Assignment Agreement. If,
following the receipt of a Requested Purchase Price Amount on a Value Date, the Platform Provider has acquired
(or determines that it will on such Value Date acquire) insufficient VFZ Accounts Receivable to apply the whole of
the Requested Purchase Price Amount received on such Value Date, the Platform Provider will either (i) serve, on
such Value Date, one or more notices (substantially in the form set out in the Framework Assignment Agreement,
each, a “Purchase Price Return Notice”) to the Issuer and, on the Business Day following the date of such
Purchase Price Return Notice (a “Settlement Date”), pay to the Issuer Collection Account, the excess Requested
Purchase Price Amount not applied towards the purchase of VFZ Accounts Receivable (such excess, the “Excess
**Requested Purchase Price Amount”); or (ii) retain such Excess Requested Purchase Price Amount for a period of**
up to four Business Days following such Value Date (an “Excess Retention Period”, and the final day thereof
(which, at the Platform Provider’s discretion, may occur prior to the fourth Business Day following such Value
Date), the “Excess Retention Period End Date”) to be applied towards the purchase of any VFZ Accounts
Receivable arising during such Excess Retention Period. If the Platform Provider chooses to retain such Excess
Requested Purchase Price Amount, it further agrees that (i) if the Platform Provider acquires any VFZ Accounts
Receivable during such Excess Retention Period, it will sell and assign such VFZ Accounts Receivables to the
Issuer (and the Platform Provider will be deemed to have served an Assignment Notice in respect of such Assigned
Receivables); and (ii) on the Business Day prior to the Excess Retention Period End Date, the Platform Provider
will serve a Purchase Price Return Notice in respect of any remaining Excess Requested Purchase Price Amount to
the Issuer, and subsequently pay such remaining Excess Requested Purchase Price Amount to the Issuer Collection
Account on such Excess Retention Period End Date, together with all Excess Requested Purchase Price Interest (as
defined below) due in respect thereof. “Excess Requested Purchase Price Interest” shall accrue daily at the
Funding Rate, calculated on any Excess Requested Purchase Price Amount retained by the Platform Provider (and
not applied towards the purchase of VFZ Accounts Receivable), from (and including) the first day of the relevant
Excess Retention Period to (and including) the relevant Excess Retention Period End Date, or such later date on
which the Issuer receives such Excess Requested Purchase Price Amount together with all interest due in respect
thereof. As used herein, “Funding Rate” means a rate equal to the per annum margin specified in Clause 13.1 of
the APMSA (less the Platform Provider Processing Fee) over 1-month EURIBOR; provided that if 1-month
EURIBOR is less than zero, 1-month EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero.

Additionally, if on any Business Day the aggregate Requested Purchase Price Amounts held by the Platform
Provider (and not applied towards the purchase of VFZ Accounts Receivable) exceeds the Requested Purchase
Price Amount Aggregate Limit (such excess, an “Aggregate Amount Excess”), the Platform Provider will
immediately serve a Purchase Price Return Notice in respect of such Aggregate Amount Excess, and pay such
Aggregate Amount Excess to the Issuer Collection Account on the relevant Settlement Date. Any Aggregate
Amount Excess not returned to the Issuer by the relevant Settlement Date (such amount, a “Delayed Aggregate
**Amount”) shall accrue interest daily at the Funding Rate, calculated from (and including) such Settlement Date**
to (and including) such later date on which the Issuer receives the Delayed Aggregate Amount, together with all
interest due in respect thereof (the “Delayed Aggregate Amount Interest”).

_Collections on Assigned Receivables and Further Purchases of VFZ Accounts Receivable with Collected_
_Principal Amounts_

Prior to the service of an Obligor Enforcement Notification (as defined and further described below), the
Platform Provider will act as collection agent for the Issuer in respect of any Collected Amounts received or
recovered relating to Assigned Receivables, in accordance with the SCF Platform Documents. Except in
circumstances where certain Collected Principal Amounts are applied towards the purchase of new VFZ
Accounts Receivable (as further described below), the Platform Provider will apply any Collected Amount,
within one Business Day of receipt or recovery thereof (such scheduled date of application, a “Collected
**Amount Forwarding Date”), in or towards the repayment to the Issuer of an amount equal to the Outstanding**
Amount of the relevant Assigned Receivables (to the extent that such Assigned Receivables remain outstanding
and has not been settled or otherwise paid to the Issuer).

147


-----

From time to time, the Platform Provider may serve an Assignment Notice (a “Primary Assignment
**Notice”) which states that any Collected Principal Amounts in respect of Assigned Receivables relating to such**
Primary Assignment Notice are to be treated as further payments of Requested Purchase Price Amounts. So long
as (i) no Non-Compliance Event has occurred and is continuing (and in respect of which the Issuer has notified
the Platform Provider that the purchase mechanics described in this paragraph will not apply), (ii) the Requested
Purchase Price Amount Aggregate Limit will not be exceeded upon the deemed payment of the Requested
Purchase Price Amount in the New Assignment Notice (as defined below), upon receipt by the Platform Provider
of any Collected Amount on an Assigned Receivable relating to such Primary Assignment Notice, or (iii) no
notice of termination has been served (as further described below), then (a) the Platform Provider will be deemed
to have served an Assignment Notice on exactly the same terms as the Primary Assignment Notice, except for the
Requested Purchase Price Amount (which will be equal to the Collected Principal Amount that would otherwise
be due and payable to the Issuer) (such notice, the “New Assignment Notice”); and (b) the Platform Provider’s
obligation to pay such Collected Principal Amount to the Issuer will be set off against the Issuer’s obligation to
pay the Requested Purchase Price Amount under the New Assignment Notice. For the avoidance of doubt, the
purchase mechanics described in this paragraph will not affect the Platform Provider’s obligation to pay to the
Issuer any Premium on the relevant Collected Amount Forwarding Date. If, three Business Days following the
service of a New Assignment Notice, the Platform Provider still holds any Collected Amounts which have not
been utilised for the purchase of new VFZ Accounts Receivable (such amounts, “Unutilised Collected
**Amounts”), the Platform Provider will immediately serve a Purchase Price Return Notice to the Issuer in respect**
of such Unutilised Collected Amounts, and will pay such Unutilised Collected Amounts to the Issuer Collection
Account on the relevant Settlement Date. The Platform Provider will pay the Issuer interest on any “Retained
**Collected Amounts” (being any Collected Amount which has not been paid to the Issuer towards satisfaction of**
the relevant Outstanding Amount and not been used to purchase further VFZ Accounts Receivable as described
above). Interest on Retained Collected Amounts shall accrue daily at the Funding Rate, calculated from (and
including) the relevant scheduled Collected Amount Forwarding Date to (and including) the relevant Settlement
Date or such later date on which the Issuer receives the Retained Collected Amount, together with all interest due
in respect thereof, as the case may be (the “Retained Collected Amount Interest”), and will be paid to the
Issuer Collection Account on the relevant Settlement Date or such later date, as applicable.

_Obligor Events of Default and Obligor Enforcement Notification_

The Issuer may not serve (or cause or permit to be served) a notice to the Obligors informing them of an
Assignment (an “Obligor Enforcement Notification”) prior to the occurrence of (i) a failure by any Obligor to
pay any Payment Obligation in full to the Platform Provider on the date such payment was due (taking into
account any applicable grace period under the APMSA), (ii) a specified insolvency event in respect of any
Obligor, (iii) a breach of the representations and warranties of the Buyer Parent with respect to the eligibility of
the VFZ Accounts Receivable, which is not capable of remedy (or if such breach is capable of remedy, is not
remedied within five Business Days of notice) (each such event in (i) to (iii), an “Obligor Event of Default”), or
(iv) a specified insolvency event in respect of the Platform Provider. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to the
_Receivables and the SCF Platform—The transfer of VFZ Accounts Receivable under the Framework Assignment_
_Agreement takes place only under equity until an Obligor Enforcement Notification is given to the Obligors”._
Following the occurrence of any of the foregoing events, the Issuer may serve or direct the Platform Provider to
serve an Obligor Enforcement Notification (provided that the Platform Provider may, but is not obliged to, serve
an Obligor Enforcement Notification at any time as it sees fit and pursuant to the circumstances described in the
paragraph below).

As soon as reasonably practicable after the occurrence of an Obligor Event of Default, the Platform Provider
will, among other things, (i) provide the Issuer with notice of such Obligor Event of Default and the details
thereof, as well as regular status updates with respect to the affected Assigned Receivables; (ii) turn over to the
Issuer any Purchase Price Return Amount in accordance with the terms of the Framework Assignment
Agreement; and (iii) in consultation with the Issuer and the Buyer Parent (provided such consultation is permitted
by the terms of the Framework Assignment Agreement), take (or refrain from taking) any steps that the Platform
Provider sees fit to recover all amounts payable, as well as default interest and other costs and expenses, each as
permitted under the APMSA and the relevant Discounted Payments Purchase Agreement(s).

Following service of an Obligor Enforcement Notification, the Platform Provider will cease to act as the
Issuer’s collection agent in respect of the relevant Assigned Receivables. For a further description of the
provisions relating to Obligor Events of Default and Obligor Enforcement Notifications, see “Summary of
_Principal Documents—Framework Assignment Agreement” included elsewhere in this Offering Circular._

_Assignment and Termination_

The Issuer may assign or transfer its rights under the Framework Assignment Agreement and the
Assignment Framework Notes (including its rights to Assigned Receivables), without the consent of the other
parties only in certain specified circumstances and in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Framework
Assignment Agreement, as further described under “Summary of Principal Documents—Framework Assignment
_Agreement” included elsewhere in this Offering Circular. Similarly, the Platform Provider may assign or transfer_
its rights under the Framework Assignment Agreement in the same such specified circumstances; provided,
_however, that the Platform Provider may assign or transfer any of its rights in Assigned Receivables to an_
affiliate without the consent of any other party, and may also assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations
under the Framework Assignment Agreement, as the provider and administrator of the SCF Platform, with the
prior written consent of the Issuer (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

The Framework Assignment Agreement and/or any Assignment Framework Note issued thereunder may be
terminated by the Issuer or the Platform Provider upon 10 Business Days’ prior notice to the other parties thereto;
_provided that with respect to a termination by the Platform Provider, the effective date of the termination shall_
not be earlier than the effective date of termination of the APMSA (as further described below). Additionally, the
Platform Provider and/or the Issuer may terminate the Framework Assignment Agreement and/or any
Assignment Framework Note with immediate effect upon the occurrence of certain events, including a breach of
material obligations of the Buyer Parent (subject to a 30 days grace period), a material breach of the
representation and warranties of the Buyer Parent (subject to a 30 days grace period), or if a specified insolvency
event has occurred in respect of the Buyer Parent. For a further description of termination events, see “Summary
_of Principal Documents—Framework Assignment Agreement” included elsewhere in this Offering Circular._

The terms of the related SCF Platform documents are more fully described below under “SCF Platform
_Documents”._

**_New VFZ Facilities_**

On any Business Day which is not a Value Date, and on any Value Date (in this case, to the extent that there
are any Committed Principal Proceeds that cannot be invested in VFZ Accounts Receivable due to a shortage of
VFZ Accounts Receivable available for purchase through the SCF Platform), the Issuer will utilize any Excess
Cash to make interest-bearing Excess Cash Loans to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower under the New VFZ
Facilities Agreement, as further described below. This use of Excess Cash, together with the interest earned on
the Issue Date Facility Loans, will provide the Issuer with the same rate of return in respect of the Committed
Principal Proceeds not invested in VFZ Accounts Receivable (including any Retained Collected Amounts) as
Noteholders will receive in respect of the Notes, instead of leaving the same funds (represented by the Excess
Cash) uninvested in the Principal Proceeds Account pending their application for the purchase of VFZ Accounts
Receivable. In addition, since the Issuer was formed solely for the purpose of facilitating the Transactions and
issuing the Notes, and is not expected to engage in any business activities other than those related to its formation
and the Transactions (including the offering of the Notes and the funding of loans under the New VFZ Facilities
Agreement), the Issuer intends to lend any Interest Proceeds that it collects from time to time to the New VFZ
Facilities Borrower, in the form of non-interest bearing Interest Facility Loans under the New VFZ Facilities
Agreement, as further described below. The Issuer will also fund interest-bearing Issue Date Facility Loans under
the Issue Date Facility, as further described below. Proceeds of any loans made by the Issuer to the New VFZ
Facilities Borrower under the New VFZ Facilities Agreement may be used by the New VFZ Facilities Borrower
for general corporate purposes.

On the Issue Date, the Issuer, as lender, will enter into a senior unsecured facilities agreement (the “New
**VFZ Facilities Agreement”) with the New VFZ Facilities Borrower, as borrower, the New VFZ Facilities**
Obligors, as guarantors, and The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch as administrator for the Issuer
(together with any successor thereto approved or appointed by the Issuer, the “Administrator”), pursuant to
which the Issuer will make available to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower revolving and term credit facilities,
consisting of the Interest Facility, the Excess Cash Facility and the Issue Date Facility, as described below.

_Interest Facility_

The New VFZ Facilities Agreement will provide for a revolving credit facility (the “Interest Facility”)
under which the Issuer will from time to time fund non-interest-bearing Interest Facility Loans to the New VFZ
Facilities Borrower.

149


-----

Following the Issue Date, on any Business Day other than the Business Day prior to an Interest Payment
Date, if the Interest Proceeds deposited in the Interest Proceeds Account are greater than zero, the Issuer will
apply such Interest Proceeds to fund a new Interest Facility Loan to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower.

_Excess Cash Facility_

The New VFZ Facilities Agreement will also provide for a revolving credit facility (the “Excess Cash
**Facility”), in an aggregate principal amount up to the Committed Principal Proceeds, under which the Issuer will**
from time to time fund Excess Cash Loans to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower. Interest on Excess Cash Loans
will be payable semi-annually in arrears on the earlier of (i) each 15 April and 15 October, commencing 15 April
2020 (each, an “Excess Cash Interest Period Date”) and (ii) upon repayment of a Weekly Excess Cash
Repayment Amount (as defined below). Interest will accrue from the funding date of any Excess Cash Loan at a
rate of % per annum, and will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day
months. Payment of interest in respect of any interest period ending on any Excess Cash Interest Period Date will
occur no less than one Business Day prior to such Excess Cash Interest Period Date.

On or following the Issue Date, the Issuer will use the Committed Principal Proceeds, firstly, to purchase
available VFZ Accounts Receivable pursuant to the Framework Assignment Agreement and, secondly, to fund
an initial Excess Cash Loan.

Following the Issue Date, as the Platform Provider (on a weekly basis) serves or is deemed to serve an
Assignment Notice to the Issuer instructing the Issuer to pay a Requested Purchase Price Amount (as may be
adjusted or off set pursuant to the terms of the Framework Assignment Agreement) as consideration for the sale
and assignment of the relevant VFZ Accounts Receivable on the relevant Value Date, the Issuer will, upon not
less than five Business Days’ prior notice, demand repayment by the New VFZ Facilities Borrower of such
portion of principal of any outstanding Excess Cash Loans as is equal to (i) such Requested Purchase Price
Amount to be paid for VFZ Accounts Receivable that the Issuer expects to purchase on such Value Date, less
(ii) any Interim Platform Amounts credited on such Value Date (such amount demanded, a “Weekly Excess
**Cash Repayment Amount”). The New VFZ Facilities Borrower will be obligated to pay into the Issuer**
Collection Account (for immediate onwards crediting to the Principal Proceeds Account) the Weekly Excess
Cash Repayment Amount on the fifth Business Day following receipt of such notice. The interest accrued on
such Weekly Excess Cash Repayment Amount will not be repaid but will, on that date, be deemed loaned to the
New VFZ Facilities Borrower under a new Interest Facility Loan. On the relevant Value Date, the Issuer will
apply the Weekly Excess Cash Repayment Amount so received, together with any Interim Platform Amounts
credited on the same day, towards its purchase of VFZ Accounts Receivable.

On any Business Day (other than the date on which the Notes are redeemed or repaid, in whole or in part (or
on which corresponding payment by the New VFZ Facilities Borrower is required to be made to the Issuer in
relation to any such redemption or repayment)), if the balance of funds deposited into the Principal Proceeds
Account is greater than zero, the Issuer will apply such funds, firstly, towards the purchase of available VFZ
Accounts Receivable in accordance with the Framework Assignment Agreement (if such Business Day is also a
Value Date) and, secondly, to fund an Excess Cash Loan to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower.

_Issue Date Facility_

The New VFZ Facilities Agreement will further provide for a term loan facility (the “Issue Date Facility”
and, together with the Interest Facility and the Excess Cash Facility, the “New VFZ Facilities”), under which the
Issuer will fund interest-bearing loans to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower (the “Issue Date Facility Loans”).
Interest on the Issue Date Facility Loans will be payable semi-annually in arrears on each 15 April and
15 October (each, an “Issue Date Facility Interest Period Date”). Interest will accrue from the Issue Date at a
rate of % per annum, and will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprising twelve 30-day
months. Payment of interest in respect of any interest period ending on any Issue Date Facility Interest Period
Date will occur no less than one Business Day prior to such Issue Date Facility Interest Period Date.

On or prior to the Issue Date, the New VFZ Facilities Borrower, the Issuer and Stichting Trade Finance (in
its capacity as the sole shareholder of the Issuer, the “Foundation”) will enter into an agreement pursuant to
which the New VFZ Facilities Borrower will agree to pay the Foundation an amount representing the
Subscription Proceeds and the Subscriber Profit in return for the Foundation procuring that the Issuer enters into
certain Transaction Documents in connection with the offering of the Notes. Such payment will be conditional on
the Foundation subscribing for an amount of the Issuer’s ordinary shares equal to the Minimum Issuer

150


-----

Capitalization Amount (the “Issue Date Shares”), which the Issuer will allot and issue to the Foundation. The
Issuer will lend the Subscription Proceeds from the Issue Date Shares, if any, to the New VFZ Facilities
Borrower as an Issue Date Facility Loan under the Issue Date Facility. In practice, the process will be almost
cashless, as nearly all of the payment by the New VFZ Facilities Borrower to the Foundation will ultimately be
loaned back to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower as an Issue Date Facility Loan.

Principal and accrued interest (if applicable) on the New VFZ Facilities will become due and payable in full on
the earlier of (i) the Maturity Date of the Notes or (ii) the date of early redemption of the Notes in accordance
with the Conditions.

The New VFZ Facilities Agreement will also provide for certain payments to the Issuer by the New VFZ
Facilities Borrower and certain payments to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower by the Issuer. On the Issue Date,
pursuant to the New VFZ Facilities Agreement, the New VFZ Facilities Borrower will pay to the Issuer an
upfront payment in an amount equal to any underwriting fees, commissions and/ or certain expenses incurred or
paid by the Issuer in relation to the issuance of the Notes (if any). In addition, the New VFZ Facilities Agreement
will provide for the periodic payment of Shortfall Payments or Excess Arrangement Payments, as described
below under “ —Payment of Interest on the Notes.”

**_Payment of Interest on the Notes_**

Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrear on each 15 April and 15 October (each, an
“Interest Payment Date”), commencing in the case of the Notes offered hereby, 15 April 2020. Interest on the
Notes will accrue from the Issue Date at a rate of % per annum, and will be computed on the basis of a
360-day year comprising of twelve 30-day months. Pursuant to the terms of the New VFZ Facilities Agreement
and the Expenses Agreement, and in consideration of the Issuer providing the New VFZ Facilities to the New
VFZ Facilities Borrower, the New VFZ Facilities Borrower will make certain payments to the Issuer to the extent
necessary to enable the Issuer to make interest payments when due under the Notes. The Issuer will fund the
payment of scheduled interest on the Notes on each Interest Payment Date from the Interest Proceeds Account as
follows:

1. firstly, to the extent that there are amounts in the Interest Proceeds Account on the Business Day prior
to such Interest Payment Date, the Issuer will utilize such amounts, towards the payment of scheduled
interest on the Notes;

2. secondly, the Issuer will demand, upon no less than six Business Days’ notice prior to such Interest
Payment Date, that the New VFZ Facilities Borrower prepay Interest Facility Loans under the Interest
Facility (and the New VFZ Facilities Borrower will repay such Interest Facility Loans on or prior to the
fifth Business Day following receipt of such demand), in a principal amount equal to the lesser of:

a. an amount equal to the interest due and payable on the Notes on such Interest Payment Date less
any amounts in the Interest Proceeds Account referred to in paragraph (1) above; and

b. the total amount of Interest Facility Loans outstanding on the Business Day prior to such Interest
Payment Date.

The Issuer will deposit the proceeds of any Interest Facility Loans so prepaid into the Interest Proceeds
Account;

3. thirdly, on or prior to the Business Day immediately preceding each Interest Payment Date (other than
the Maturity Date of the Notes or at early redemption of the Notes in accordance with the Conditions),
the New VFZ Facilities Borrower will make a payment to the Issuer (each, as calculated in accordance
with the Agency and Account Bank Agreement, a “Term Shortfall Payment”) in an amount equal to
the positive difference, if any, between (i) the amount of interest due on the Notes on such Interest
Payment Date, less (ii) the sum of (x) the amount of any Interest Facility Loans to be repaid pursuant to
paragraph (2) above and (y) amounts in the Interest Proceeds Account referred to in paragraph
(1) above.

4. By contrast to the Term Shortfall Payment, to the extent that on any Interest Payment Date (other than
the Maturity Date of the Notes or at early redemption of the Notes in accordance with the Conditions)
there is any balance on the Interest Facility Loans not repaid by the New VFZ Facilities Borrower to
the Issuer pursuant to paragraph (2) above, the Issuer will make a payment to the New VFZ Facilities
Borrower (each, as calculated in accordance with the Agency and Account Bank Agreement, a “Term
**Excess Arrangement Payment”) in an amount equal to such balance of the Interest Facility Loans**

151


-----

outstanding on such Interest Payment Date. Any Term Excess Arrangement Payment will be paid as a
rebate of previously paid interest (on a cashless basis, by offsetting such Term Excess Arrangement
Payment against the amounts due by the New VFZ Facilities Borrower under the Interest Facility
Loans).

5. fourthly, on or prior to the Business Day immediately preceding the final Interest Payment Date (being
the Maturity Date of the Notes or at early redemption of the Notes in accordance with the Conditions),
the New VFZ Facilities Borrower will make a payment to the Issuer (as calculated in accordance with
the Agency and Account Bank Agreement, a “Maturity Shortfall Payment” and, together with the
Term Shortfall Payments, the “Shortfall Payments” and each a “Shortfall Payment”) in an amount
equal to the positive difference, if any, between (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be
repaid together with the amount of interest due on the Notes on such final Interest Payment Date, less
(ii) the sum of:

a. all Collected Amounts on all Assigned Receivables to be repaid or prepaid to the Issuer on or prior
to two Business Days prior to the final Interest Payment Date;

b. any other amounts (including any accrued interest) due to be paid by the Platform Provider to the
Issuer pursuant to the Framework Assignment Agreement on or prior to two Business Days prior
to the final Interest Payment Date;

c. the principal amount of and interest due on all of the New VFZ Facilities Loans to be paid to the
Issuer on maturity of the New VFZ Facilities Loans; and

d. all other amounts in the Issuer Transaction Accounts (to the extent not included in any of the
above).

6. By contrast to the Maturity Shortfall Payment, to the extent that any calculation in paragraph (5) above
results in a negative value, the Issuer will pay or transfer to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower (as
calculated in accordance with the Agency and Account Bank Agreement, a “Maturity Excess
**Payment” and, together with the Term Excess Arrangement Payments, the “Excess Arrangement**
**Payments” and each an “Excess Arrangement Payment”) (as a rebate of previously paid interest) in**
an amount which would return such negative value to zero; provided, however, that such payment will
only be made after all amounts due and payable to Noteholders under the Notes have been settled.

**_Approved Exchange Offer_**

In order to extend the availability of the committed financing for the purchase of VFZ Accounts Receivable
represented by the Committed Principal Proceeds beyond the Maturity Date of the Notes, the New VFZ Facilities
Borrower may, at any time, enter into an exchange offer and payables financing plan agreement (a “Plan
**Agreement”) with a new entity (a “New Issuer”). Pursuant to any such Plan Agreement, the New Issuer will**
procure from the New VFZ Facilities Borrower a commitment to cancel amounts of the New VFZ Facilities as
set forth below, and will enter into agreements with the New VFZ Facilities Borrower, VodafoneZiggo, the
Platform Provider, the Notes Trustee and other relevant counterparties providing for the New Issuer’s purchase
of VFZ Accounts Receivable on terms and conditions substantially similar to the Transaction Documents.

Promptly after entering into the Plan Agreement, the New Issuer will launch an exchange offer (the
“Approved Exchange Offer”) designed to allow Noteholders to exchange up to a specified principal amount of
Notes for a principal amount of new notes (the “New Notes”) to be set out in the Approved Exchange Offer.
Upon consummation of the Approved Exchange Offer, subject to the terms of the Trust Deed:

(i) The New Issuer will issue a specified amount of New Notes to the Noteholders validly tendered into
the Approved Exchange Offer and not withdrawn. If, upon the expiration of the Approved Exchange
Offer, Noteholders have validly tendered more Notes than the New Issuer is able to accept pursuant to
the Approved Exchange Offer, the New Issuer will accept for exchange Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn on a pro rata basis, based on the proportion that the aggregate principal amount of Notes to
be accepted bears to the aggregate principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn; and

(ii) The Issuer will purchase from the New Issuer any Notes accepted by the New Issuer pursuant to the
Approved Exchange Offer and will cancel such purchased Notes. As consideration for such purchase,
the Issuer will simultaneously pay, assign and transfer to the New Issuer:

(A) Assigned Receivables such that (a) minus (b) is equal to or less than (c) plus (d); where (a) is the
Committed Principal Proceeds multiplied by the Relevant Percentage, where “Relevant Percentage”

152


-----

means the proportion that the aggregate principal amount of Notes accepted into the Approved
Exchange Offer bears to the aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding as of the date of
consummation of the Approved Exchange Offer (the “Determination Date”), (b) is the aggregate
historical Purchase Price Amount of such Assigned Receivables assigned to the New Issuer pursuant to
this clause (A), (c) is the balance of Excess Cash Loans outstanding on the Determination Date, and
(d) is any Interim Platform Amounts to be credited to the Issuer on the Determination Date. The
Assigned Receivables to be assigned to the New Issuer pursuant to this clause (A) will be selected by
an independent financial, banking, accounting or other similar advisor designated by VodafoneZiggo,
the Issuer or the Administrator with a mandate to maximise the aggregate Purchase Price Amount of
the transferred Assigned Receivables whilst ensuring that they have the shortest maturities possible.
Assigned Receivables will only be assigned and transferred to the New Issuer pursuant to this clause
(A) in whole, and not in part;

(B) The cash proceeds from the repayment of Interest Facility Loans (to be demanded by the Issuer or
the Administrator) in an amount equal to (a) minus (b); where (a) is the accrued and unpaid
Premium that remained outstanding on the Assigned Receivables assigned pursuant to clause
(A) above as of the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date, and (b) is any accrued and
unpaid Retained Amount Interest that remained outstanding as of the Determination Date in
respect of the “Retained Amounts” (being collectively, Retained Collected Amounts, Delayed
Aggregate Amounts and/or Excess Requested Purchase Price Amounts) (as determined in
accordance with the Agency and Account Bank Agreement described elsewhere in this Offering
Circular) to be transferred to the New Issuer pursuant to clause (D) below, as applicable;

(C) The cash proceeds from the repayment of Excess Cash Loans (to be demanded by the Issuer or the
Administrator) in an amount equal to (a) minus (b) minus (c), where (a) is the Committed
Principal Proceeds multiplied by the Relevant Percentage, (b) is the aggregate Purchase Price
Amounts of Assigned Receivables assigned to the New Issuer pursuant to clause (A) above, and
(c) is any Interim Platform Amounts to be credited to the Issuer on the Determination Date;

(D) The cash proceeds from the payment by the Platform Provider to the Issuer on the Determination
Date of any Retained Amounts and any other Interim Platform Amounts; and

(E) An “Accrued Facility Interest and Shortfall Amount” equal to (a) minus (b) minus (c) minus
(d) minus (e), where (a) is the aggregate principal amount of Notes tendered into the Approved
Exchange Offer, (b) is the aggregate Purchase Price Amounts of the Assigned Receivables
assigned pursuant to clause (A) above plus accrued and unpaid Premium thereon through the
Determination Date, (c) is the amount of cash proceeds set out in clause (B) above, (d) is the
amount of cash proceeds set out in clause (C) above and (e) is the amount of cash proceeds set out
in clause (D) above. The Issuer will demand repayment of Excess Cash Loans in an amount equal
to any Accrued Facility Interest and Shortfall Amount in order to make such payment.

**_SCF Platform Documents_**

VFZ Accounts Receivable purchased by the Issuer pursuant to the Framework Assignment Agreement are
uploaded by the Buyer Entities to the SCF Platform (as defined in Condition 1 (Definitions and Principles of
_Construction)) managed by the Platform Provider to facilitate receivables financing provided by the Platform_
Provider and other participating funding providers, including the Issuer. The SCF Platform is made available to
VodafoneZiggo and certain of its subsidiaries, and is administered under the terms of the Accounts Payable
Management Services Agreement and the Discounted Payments Purchase Agreements described below.

_Accounts Payable Management Services Agreement_

On 23 February 2015, the Platform Provider and VodafoneZiggo, among others, entered into the Accounts
Payable Management Services Agreement (as defined in Condition 1 (Definitions and Principles of
_Construction)). Under the terms of the APMSA, the Obligors, together with certain other subsidiaries of_
VodafoneZiggo that may accede to the APMSA from time to time as further described below (collectively, the
“Buyer Entities” and each a “Buyer Entity”) may upload Electronic Data Files containing details of
Receivables on to the SCF Platform to enable the purchase by the Platform Provider of such Receivables (and the
Parent Payment Obligations arising in respect thereof) from the relevant Supplier. On the Issue Date, the eligible
Buyer Entities will be Ziggo B.V., Ziggo Services B.V. (collectively, the “Non-Obligor Buyer Subsidiaries”
and each a “Non-Obligor Buyer Subsidiary”, together with VZ Financing I B.V. and VZ Financing II B.V.
(collectively, the “Obligor Subsidiaries”), the “Buyer Subsidiaries” and each a “Buyer Subsidiary”), the

153


-----

Obligor Subsidiaries, and the Buyer Parent. Additional Buyer Subsidiaries may accede to the APMSA by
entering into an accession letter (substantially in form set out in the APMSA) with the Platform Provider and the
Buyer Parent, and an existing Buyer Subsidiary may cease to be a “Buyer Entity” for the purposes of the
APMSA if the Platform Provider or Buyer Parent provides written notice to such effect. Additional Obligor
Subsidiaries may become party to the APMSA either by acceding as a “Designated Buyer Subsidiary” (provided
they are specified as such in the relevant accession letter) or, with respect to an existing Non-Obligor Buyer
Subsidiary, if such Non-Obligor Buyer Subsidiary is specified in writing by the Buyer Parent to be a “Designated
Buyer Subsidiary” for purposes of the APMSA. Pursuant to the Agency and Account Bank Agreement, the Buyer
Parent will undertake to the Issuer that the Buyer Parent may notify the Platform Provider of a resignation of an
Obligor Subsidiary only if all Outstanding Amounts owed by such Obligor Subsidiary (as principal obligor) in
respect of its Assigned Receivables have been settled in accordance with the APMSA on or prior to the date of its
resignation, and the Buyer Parent will agree to promptly provide written notification of the same to the Issuer (or
the Administrator on its behalf).

From time to time, a Buyer Entity may execute an Upload and designate such uploaded Receivables as
“approved”. Each Approved Platform Receivable will initially give rise to a Parent Payment Obligation, being an
independent and primary obligation by VodafoneZiggo (on the basis described in the sections entitled
“Description of the Receivables” and “Summary of Principal Documents—Accounts Payable Management
_Services Agreement” included elsewhere in this Offering Circular) to make payment or cause payment of the_
Certified Amount (as defined below) to be made to the relevant recipient on the Confirmed Payment Date in
respect thereof. Upon each Initial Transfer (being the sale and assignment of a Parent Payment Obligation and
the applicable Receivable related thereto from the Supplier to the Platform Provider through the SCF Platform),
the relevant Parent Payment Obligation will become a Payment Obligation, pursuant to which each Obligor will
become jointly and severally liable with each other Obligor to make payment or cause payment to be made to the
relevant recipient on the Confirmed Payment Date in respect thereof. The Non-Obligor Buyer Subsidiaries will
not be liable for any Payment Obligations. The Buyer Parent has notified the Platform Provider in writing that
eligible Receivables (as further described in “Summary of Principal Documents—Accounts Payable Management
_Services Agreement” included elsewhere in this Offering Circular) may include those with a Confirmed Payment_
Date of up to 360 days from the issuance date of the relevant invoice. In respect of Initial Transfers of such
Receivables a margin of 2.20% per annum calculated on the basis of the relevant Outstanding Amounts (which
includes the Platform Provider Processing Fee) over the base rate (the “Margin”) shall be applied from the date
of the relevant Initial Transfer until the Confirmed Payment Date in respect of such Payment Obligation (and the
Receivable related thereto, solely to the extent that such Receivable has been acquired by the Platform Provider).
The base rate (being, in this case, Euribor with a floor of zero) is determined by the remaining tenor between the
date of the relevant transfer and the Confirmed Payment Date (i.e. between 1 and 30 days, 1 month base rate will
apply; between 31 and 60 days, 2 months base rate will apply). The applicable base rate plus the applicable
Margin are used to calculate the Applied Discount that the Platform Provider will deduct from the Certified
Amount in the case of transfer by the Platform Provider of the VFZ Account Receivable prior to the Confirmed
Payment Date, and accordingly is used in the calculation of the Purchase Price Amount for each VFZ Account
Receivable. The Margin under the APMSA may not be amended without the written consent of the Issuer, and
pursuant to the terms of the other Transaction Documents, the Issuer will agree to provide its written consent to
any amendment of the Margin (without being required to seek the consent of the Noteholders) so long as the
obligations of the New VFZ Facilities Borrower in favour of the Issuer under Clause 11.2 (“Facility Fees”) of the
New VFZ Facilities Agreement remain in full force and effect.

Pursuant to the APMSA, the Buyer Parent and, as applicable, each Obligor Subsidiary appoints the Platform
Provider as paying agent with respect to the settlement of any VFZ Account Receivable. Settlement requires the
Buyer Parent (or, at its option, an Obligor Subsidiary) to make an electronic transfer of the Certified Amount (as
defined below) to the Platform Provider’s designated bank account on the Confirmed Payment Date, and the
Platform Provider will, in turn, transfer such Certified Amount (or part thereof as received by the Platform
Provider) to the relevant recipient (which shall be the Issuer in respect of Assigned Receivables) on the same
Confirmed Payment Date. As used herein, “Certified Amount” means, with respect to a Payment Obligation, the
Outstanding Amount of such Payment Obligation on the “Certified Amount Fixed Date”, being earliest to
occur of (i) the date of the Initial Transfer, and (ii) the date falling three Business Days prior to the Confirmed
Payment Date of that Payment Obligation. Failure by any Obligor to pay all or any part of the Certified Amount
by the Confirmed Payment Date will cause default interest to accrue on the unpaid sum at a rate of 1-month
Euribor (floored at zero) plus 7% per annum, until the Certified Amount has been discharged in full.

If a Buyer Entity wishes to reduce the amount of any Approved Platform Receivable for any reason
(including as a result of any lien, right of set-off, defence, claim, counterclaim, or other certain adverse claim), it

154


-----

may post the amount to be deducted from such Approved Platform Receivable (each, a “Credit Note”) as an
entry in an Electronic Data File to the SCF Platform Website and such Credit Note will be allocated to the
corresponding Payment Obligation on the following Business Day. No Credit Notes may be allocated to a
Payment Obligation following the relevant Certified Amount Fixed Date. Additionally, each Buyer Entity agrees
to be responsible for the accuracy of all information submitted by them onto the SCF Platform Website in respect
of VFZ Accounts Receivable and the Buyer Parent agrees to comply with certain reporting requirements set out
in the APMSA.

Under the APMSA, each Buyer Entity represents, warrants and covenants to the Platform Provider at the
date of an Upload resulting in any Payment Obligation arising and at the date of any transfer via the SCF
Platform of a Payment Obligation and the Receivable related thereto (solely to the extent that such Receivable
has been acquired by the Platform Provider) (including each Assignment Date), as applicable, among other
things: (i) that the Approved Platform Receivable relating to each Payment Obligation meets certain criteria
under the APMSA, including (but not limited to) having a Confirmed Payment Date of no more than 360 days
from the issuance date of the relevant invoice and being denominated in an agreed currency; (ii) that the
Approved Platform Receivable is not subject to any mortgage, charge, pledge, lien, other encumbrance or other
personal right or right in rem of any third party and has, to the best of the relevant Buyer Entity’s knowledge, not
been transferred or transferred in advance; (iii) that each Payment Obligation and the Receivable related thereto
(solely to the extent that such Receivable has been acquired by the Platform Provider) is free of any adverse
claims, including any lien, right of set-off, netting, abatement, reduction, claim, defence or counterclaim; (iv) that
each Payment Obligation and Receivable related thereto (solely to the extent that such Receivable has been
acquired by the Platform Provider) can be validly transferred in accordance with the terms of the APMSA; and
(v) that each Payment Obligation will be settled by an Obligor by the payment of the relevant Certified Amount
on the relevant Confirmed Payment Date without withholding, deduction or set-off.

The APMSA also provides that the following occurrences, among others, constitute events of default,
whereupon the Platform Provider shall have the right (but not the obligation) to suspend the provision of
accounts payable management services and prohibit the creation of any further Payment Obligations (each, an
“APMSA Event of Default”): (i) breach by any Buyer Entity of any obligation or certain representations,
warranties or covenants in the APMSA, if not remedied for a period of ten days (which grace period shall not
apply if such breach relates to a financial interest of an amount in excess of €5.0 million); (ii) non-payment of
any amount due under the APMSA, including all or any part of any Certified Amount (subject to a grace period
of one Business Day in the case of principal, and three Business Days in the case of any other amount); (iii) if
any Buyer Entity is unable, deemed unable, or admits inability to pay its debts as they fall due; and (iv) any
corporate action, legal proceedings or other procedure is taken in relation to the suspension of payments,
winding-up, or dissolution of any Buyer Entity, or any composition, compromise, assignment or arrangement
with any creditor of any Buyer Entity, or the appointment of a liquidator, receiver, or other similar officer in
respect of any Buyer Entity.

The Buyer Parent has also agreed to provide certain indemnities to the Platform Provider under the APMSA,
including (but not limited to) indemnities against any losses directly suffered for or on account of tax, reasonable
losses incurred as a direct result of any APMSA Event of Default or failure by any Buyer Entity to pay any
amount due under the APMSA, and any costs, expenses, claims or losses incurred as a result of the incorrect
calculation by any Buyer Entity of the amount of any Receivable uploaded in an Electronic Data File.

The Platform Provider may assign, transfer or deal in any other manner with any VFZ Account Receivable
that has been transferred to it, and/or all of its rights against any Buyer Entity or under the APMSA, in part or in
whole, to any third party. No Buyer Entity may so assign or transfer its respective rights and obligations under
the APMSA without the written consent of the Platform Provider, and such consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

Each of the Platform Provider and the Buyer Parent may unilaterally terminate the APMSA upon notice to
the other party, if such other party breaches a material provision of the APMSA and fails to cure such breach
within 10 days following written notice from the other party requiring them to remedy such breach. The Platform
Provider may also terminate the APMSA: (i) for any reason upon 12 months’ prior written notice to the Buyer
Parent; and (ii) immediately, upon written notice, if it becomes unlawful for the Platform Provider in any
applicable jurisdiction to perform any of its obligations thereunder. The Buyer Parent may terminate the APMSA
for any reason upon 20 Business Days’ prior written notice to the Platform Provider. Following termination of
the APMSA, the Buyer Entities will no longer be permitted to use to the SCF Platform. All rights, duties and
obligations of the parties to the APMSA with respect to the Payment Obligations posted to the SCF Platform
prior to the effective date of any termination shall survive the termination of the APMSA.

_Discounted Payments Purchase Agreements_

In conjunction with the SCF Platform, each Supplier has entered into, or will enter into, a Discounted
Payments Purchase Agreement (each based on a standard form and as defined in Condition 1 (Definitions and
_Principles of Construction)) with the Platform Provider. Upon an Upload by a Buyer Entity and the designation_
of such uploaded Receivable as “approved”, (i) the price of such Receivable is increased (in accordance with the
relevant supply contract) by adding to the initial face value of such Receivable the Applied Discount (as defined
in the context of the APMSA) (as displayed on the SCF Platform on the relevant day) calculated for the period
between the date of the Upload and the Confirmed Payment Date; and (ii) the Supplier to which such Approved
Platform Receivable relates will automatically and irrevocably offer to sell to the Platform Provider the relevant
Parent Payment Obligation and the Receivable related thereto at a discounted price (as determined by deducting
from the grossed-up amount of the relevant invoice (calculated in accordance with the relevant supply contract as
described above), such Applied Discount (as defined in the context of the APMSA) (as displayed on the SCF
Platform on the relevant day), such that the Platform Provider pays an amount equal to the original face value of
such invoice owed to the Supplier). Each such offer accepted by the Platform Provider pursuant to a Discounted
Payments Purchase Agreement will result in the sale, assignment and transfer to the Platform Provider of all of
such Supplier’s rights, title and interest in and to the relevant Parent Payment Obligation and the Receivable
related thereto.

The Supplier is deemed to represent and warrant to the Platform Provider upon the date of each offer (and
the date of the relevant Initial Transfer) that, with respect to each Parent Payment Obligation (and any Receivable
related thereto, where applicable), among other things: (i) the Supplier (solely) holds the full legal and beneficial
right, title and interest in and to the relevant Parent Payment Obligation and the Receivable related thereto;
(ii) the Supplier is entitled to sell and transfer the relevant Parent Payment Obligation and the Receivable related
thereto to the Platform Provider pursuant to the terms of the relevant Discounted Payments Purchase Agreement,
and the relevant Parent Payment Obligation and the Receivable related thereto is transferred to the Platform
Provider following acceptance of the offer; (iii) no mortgage, charge, pledge, lien, other encumbrance or other
personal right or right in rem exists in relation to the relevant Parent Payment Obligation or Receivable related
thereto, and the relevant Parent Payment Obligation has not been transferred nor made subject to any mortgage,
charge, pledge, lien, or other encumbrance in advance; and (iv) the Parent Payment Obligation and the
Receivable related thereto is free of any adverse claims, including any lien, right of set-off, netting, abatement,
reduction, claim, defence or counterclaim. Following each Initial Transfer, the Platform Provider, in its capacity
as agent for the relevant Supplier, shall provide notice of such transfer to the Buyer Parent and the relevant Buyer
Subsidiary.

Additionally, pursuant to the relevant Discounted Payments Purchase Agreement, any tax applicable to the
transfer from the Supplier to the Platform Provider of a Parent Payment Obligation and any Receivable related
thereto shall be solely payable by that Supplier. The Supplier also represents and warrants that upon payment by
the Platform Provider of the outstanding amount owing under any Parent Payment Obligation to the relevant
bank account established in such Supplier’s own name on the Confirmed Payment Date, the applicable Parent
Payment Obligation shall be satisfied and the relevant Buyer Entity’s obligation to pay the Supplier for the
corresponding Receivable shall be extinguished in an amount equal to such amount paid.

Subject to the agreement of the relevant Suppliers to the standard form, each Discounted Payments Purchase
Agreement gives the Platform Provider the right, without the consent of or notice to the Supplier, to assign,
transfer, mortgage, charge or otherwise deal in any other manner with any or all of its rights and obligations
under the relevant Discounted Payments Purchase Agreement, in whole or in part (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any of the Parent Payment Obligations and Receivables related thereto purchased by the Platform Provider
thereunder). In turn, pursuant to the Framework Assignment Agreement (as described above), the Platform
Provider’s right, title and interest in and to the whole of each VFZ Account Receivable are assigned to the Issuer.
For a further description of the Discounted Payments Purchase Agreements, see “Summary of Principal
_Documents—Discounted Payments Purchase Agreements”._

**_SCF Platform Addition_**

At any time, VodafoneZiggo and the Buyer Subsidiaries may, at their option, elect to participate in an
additional online system established and administered by another Platform Provider (an “SCF Platform
**Addition”). In connection with any SCF Platform Addition, VodafoneZiggo and the Buyer Subsidiaries may**
enter into additional accounts payable management services agreements (or equivalent) and the Issuer may (and
upon request by VodafoneZiggo, shall) enter into one or more additional receivables assignment agreements (or

156


-----

equivalent), pursuant to which the Issuer will purchase eligible VFZ Accounts Receivable from such additional
Platform Provider. The consent of the Noteholders will not be required for VodafoneZiggo, the Buyer
Subsidiaries and the Issuer to give effect to any SCF Platform Addition (including the modification of any
Transaction Documents to implement such SCF Platform Addition), and the Administrator will enter into any
SCF Platform Addition Documentation if the Administrator receives written confirmation (with a copy to the
Notes Trustee) from VodafoneZiggo that, in VodafoneZiggo’s determination, the entry into such SCF Platform
Addition Documentation is reasonably required to implement such SCF Platform Addition and does not
materially and adversely affect the interests of the Noteholders.

**_Other Transaction Documents_**

The Transfer Agent, Registrar, Paying Agent, Account Bank and Administrator are herein referred to collectively
as the “Agents”.

The Notes are senior obligations of the Issuer and will be secured by the Notes Collateral for, inter alia, the
Notes created by the Trust Deed and the other Notes Security Documents.

The Conditions include summaries of, and are subject to, the detailed provisions of the Trust Deed, the
Agency and Account Bank Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. If there is any conflict between the
Conditions and the Trust Deed, the Conditions shall prevail.

form required by the Trust Deed to the effect, among other things, that such transferee is (x) a QIB and
(y) also a Qualified Purchaser. In accordance with the applicable procedures of the Clearing Systems,
upon expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note
may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Regulation S Global
Note only upon receipt by the Transfer Agent of a written certification from the transferor in the form
required by the Trust Deed to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation
S and a written certification from the transferee in the form required by the Trust Deed to the effect,
inter alia, that such transferee is a non-U.S. person purchasing such beneficial interest in such
Regulation S Global Note in an offshore transaction pursuant to Regulation S. Any beneficial interest
in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in
another Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Note, and become an

167


-----

interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions
and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Notes for as long as it
remains such an interest.

(f) The registered owner of the relevant Global Note will be the only person entitled to receive payments
in respect of the Notes represented thereby, and the Issuer will be discharged by payment to the
registered owner of such Global Note or in respect of each amount so paid. No person other than the
registered owner of the relevant Global Note will have any claim against the Issuer in respect of any
payment due on that Global Note.

(g) Except in the limited circumstances described below, owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes
will not be entitled to have Notes registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive
definitive physical Notes, and will not be considered “holders” of Notes under the Trust Deed or the
Notes. If Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as
depository for Global Notes and a successor depository or custodian is not appointed by the Issuer
within 120 days after receiving such notice, the Issuer will issue or cause to be issued, Notes in the
form of definitive physical certificates in exchange for the applicable Global Notes to the beneficial
owners of such Global Notes in the manner set forth in the Trust Deed. In addition, the owner of a
beneficial interest in a Global Note will be entitled to receive a definitive physical Note in exchange for
such interest if Euroclear and/or Clearstream so request following an Issuer Event of Default which is
continuing, or if the holder of a beneficial interest in a Global Note requests such exchange in writing
delivered through Euroclear and/or Clearstream or to the Issuer following an Issuer Event of Default
which is continuing. Additionally, the Issuer, may, at its option, notify the Notes Trustee in writing that
it elects to exchange in whole, but not in part, the Global Note for a definitive physical Note. In the
event that definitive physical certificates are not so issued by the Issuer to such beneficial owners of
interests in Global Notes, the Issuer expressly acknowledges that such beneficial owners shall be
entitled to pursue any remedy that the holders of a Global Note would be entitled to pursue in
accordance with the Trust Deed (but only to the extent of such beneficial owner’s interest in the Global
Note) as if definitive physical Notes had been issued; provided that the Notes Trustee shall be entitled
to rely, absolutely and without further enquiry, upon any certificate of ownership provided by such
beneficial owners and/or other forms of reasonable evidence of such ownership. In the event that
definitive physical Notes are issued in exchange for Global Notes as described above, the applicable
Global Note will be surrendered to the Registrar by Euroclear or Clearstream and the Issuer will
execute and the Registrar will authenticate and deliver an equal aggregate outstanding principal amount
of definitive physical Notes.

(h) The Notes will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer set forth therein and in the Trust Deed and
the Notes will bear the restrictive legend set forth under “Transfer Restrictions”.

3. **Status, Priority and Security**

_Status and Relationship between the Notes_

(a) The Notes constitute direct and, upon issue, unconditional obligations of the Issuer subject to the Trust
Deed and these Conditions and are secured by the Issuer Security over the Notes Collateral. The Notes

themselves. Certain other obligations of the Issuer rank in priority to the Notes in accordance with the
Priorities of Payments set out in this Condition 3 (Status, Priority and Security).

regard to the circumstances of individual Noteholders (and in particular the place where they are
domiciled or resident for any purpose) and no Noteholder shall have any right to be compensated by
the Issuer or any other person for the tax or other consequences for it individually of any such exercise
or performance.

(c) The Trust Deed and other Notes Security Documents contain provisions requiring the Security Trustee
to have regard solely to the interests of the Secured Parties as regards the exercise and performance of

under applicable law, the Issuer has created the following security pursuant to the Notes Security
Documents:

Receivables;

(ii) an assignment by way of security over its rights under all contracts, agreements, deeds and
documents to which it is or may become a party or in respect of which it has or may have any
right, title, benefit or interest (including, without limitation, the New VFZ Facilities Agreement,
the Expenses Agreement, the Framework Assignment Agreement and the Issue Date
Arrangements Agreement);

(iii) a first fixed charge over its rights to all amounts at any time standing to the credit of the Issuer
Transaction Accounts; and

(iv) a first floating charge over all the present and future property, assets and undertaking of the Issuer
not subject to the fixed charges or assignments by way of security described above,

the assets in (i) through (iv) above collectively, the “Notes Collateral”.

_Pre-Enforcement Priority of Payments_

(e) Until the Security Trustee serves an Enforcement Notice on the Issuer, the Administrator shall, on
behalf of the Issuer, apply Issuer Available Funds in accordance with the Agency and Account Bank
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.

the Security Trustee in or towards satisfaction of the Notes Secured Obligations in each case with
interest and any value added tax payable thereon (if applicable) as provided for in the relevant
Transaction Document in the following order of priority (the “Post-Enforcement Priority of
**Payments”) (and in each case only if and to the extent that payments or provisions of a higher priority,**

indemnity payments (if any) payable to the Security Trustee and any Appointee of the Security
Trustee and any costs, charges, liabilities and expenses incurred by it for which it is entitled to be

date of such redemption, or to the extent there are or will be Remaining Assigned
Receivables prior to the date of redemption, the Issuer shall have completed or agreed to
complete a Redemption Block Assignment of its right, title and interest in the Remaining
Assigned Receivables to any person (which, for the avoidance of doubt, can be a special
purpose vehicle) and the Issuer shall have received payment for the Redemption Block
Assignment of the Remaining Assigned Receivables prior to the date of such redemption;

(C) all amounts lent to the New VFZ Facilities Borrower under the New VFZ Facilities
Agreement are repaid to the Issuer prior to the date of such redemption; and

(D) before giving the notice referred to in paragraph (A) above, the Issuer has delivered to the
Notes Trustee an Officer’s Certificate (upon which the Notes Trustee shall be entitled to
absolutely rely without further enquiry) to the effect that it will have available, not subject to
the interest of any other person, the funds required (the “Callable Period Sufficient Funds”)
to discharge in full all amounts payable to the Noteholders on redemption of the Notes. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Callable Period Sufficient Funds may include amounts to be
repaid or prepaid under (B) and (C) above as well as any amounts due to the Issuer under the
New VFZ Facilities Agreement and the Expenses Agreement.

_Accelerated Maturity Event_

(g) Within 15 days of receiving a VFZ Change of Control Prepayment Offer from the New VFZ Facilities
Borrower under the New VFZ Facilities Agreement, the Issuer shall notify the Noteholders in
accordance with Condition 19 (Notices and Information) that a VFZ Change of Control Event has
occurred or will occur under the New VFZ Facilities Agreement, and solicit the consent of the
Noteholders (the “Maturity Consent Solicitation”) to set (i) the Maturity Date of the Notes as the
New Maturity Date and (ii) the redemption price of the Notes on the New Maturity Date at 101% of the
principal amount of the Notes (the “Accelerated Redemption Price”), plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts (if any), to the New Maturity Date.

(h) If Noteholders of more than 50% in the aggregate principal amount of the Notes consent to the terms
set out in the Maturity Consent Solicitation (an “Accelerated Maturity Event”), the Issuer shall:

(i) promptly notify the New VFZ Facilities Borrower that the Issuer accepts the VFZ Change of
Control Prepayment Offer;

(ii) amend the Transaction Documents and the Notes Trustee shall concur (without seeking further
consent of the Noteholders and subject to receiving an Officer’s Certificate or Opinion of Counsel
in accordance with the Trust Deed, upon which Officer’s Certificate or Opinion of Counsel the
Notes Trustee may rely absolutely and without further enquiry), as necessary, to reflect the New
Maturity Date and the Accelerated Redemption Price; and

(iii) redeem all of the Notes on the New Maturity Date at the Accelerated Redemption Price, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts (if any) to the New Maturity Date;

_provided that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the consent of the Noteholders shall be_
validly given if made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Maturity Consent Solicitation,
and need not comply with Schedule D (Provisions for Meetings of the Noteholders) of the Trust Deed
or any other provisions of the Trust Deed and these Conditions relating to an Extraordinary Resolution.

(i) If the Issuer does not receive the consent of more than 50% in the aggregate principal amount of the
Notes to the terms set out in the Maturity Consent Solicitation, the Issuer will promptly notify the New
VFZ Facilities Borrower that it rejects the VFZ Change of Control Prepayment Offer.

_Notice of Redemption Irrevocable_

(j) Once a notice of redemption is mailed or delivered, Notes called for redemption become irrevocably
due and payable on the specified redemption date at the redemption price; provided, however, that a
notice of redemption may be conditional.

_Approved Exchange Offer_

(k) In order to extend the availability of the committed financing for the purchase of VFZ Accounts
Receivable represented by the Committed Principal Proceeds beyond the Maturity Date of the Notes,
VFZG may, at any time, enter into an exchange offer and payables financing plan agreement (a “Plan
**Agreement”) with a new entity (a “New Issuer”). Pursuant to any such Plan Agreement, the New**
Issuer will procure from VFZG a commitment to cancel amounts of the New VFZ Facilities as set forth
below, and will enter into agreements with VFZG, the Platform Provider, the Notes Trustee and other
relevant counterparties providing for the New Issuer’s purchase of VFZ Accounts Receivable on terms
and conditions substantially similar to the Transaction Documents. Defined terms used in paragraphs
(j) and (k) of this Condition 6 (Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation; Approved Exchange Offer)
and not defined in Condition 1 (Definitions and Principles of Construction—General Interpretation)
are defined and further described above under Overview of the Structure of the Offering of the Notes.

(l) Promptly after entering into the Plan Agreement, the New Issuer will launch an exchange offer (the
“Approved Exchange Offer”) designed to allow Noteholders to exchange up to a specified principal
amount of Notes for a principal amount of new notes (the “New Notes”) to be set out in the Approved
Exchange Offer. Upon consummation of the Approved Exchange Offer, subject to the terms of the
Trust Deed:

(i) The New Issuer will issue a specified amount of New Notes to the Noteholders validly tendered
into the Approved Exchange Offer and not withdrawn. If, upon the expiration of the Approved
Exchange Offer, Noteholders have validly tendered more Notes than the New Issuer is able to
accept pursuant to the Approved Exchange Offer, the New Issuer will accept for exchange Notes
validly tendered and not withdrawn on a pro rata basis, based on the proportion that the aggregate
principal amount of Notes to be accepted bears to the aggregate principal amount of Notes validly
tendered and not withdrawn; and

(ii) The Issuer will purchase from the New Issuer any Notes accepted by the New Issuer pursuant to
the Approved Exchange Offer and will cancel such purchased Notes. As consideration for such
purchase, the Issuer will simultaneously pay, assign and transfer to the New Issuer:

(A) Assigned Receivables such that (a) minus (b) is equal to or less than (c) plus (d); where (a) is
the Committed Principal Proceeds multiplied by the Relevant Percentage, where “Relevant
**Percentage” means the proportion that the aggregate principal amount of Notes accepted**
into the Approved Exchange Offer bears to the aggregate principal amount of Notes
outstanding as of the date of consummation of the Approved Exchange Offer (the
“Determination Date”), (b) is the aggregate historical Purchase Price Amount of such
Assigned Receivables assigned to the New Issuer pursuant to this clause (A), (c) is the
balance of Excess Cash Loans outstanding on the Determination Date, and (d) is any Interim
Platform Amounts to be credited to the Issuer on the Determination Date. The Assigned
Receivables to be assigned to the New Issuer pursuant to this clause (A) will be selected by
an independent financial, banking, accounting or other similar advisor designated by VFZG,
the Issuer or the Administrator on behalf of the Issuer with a mandate to maximise the
aggregate Purchase Price Amount of the transferred Assigned Receivables whilst ensuring
that they have the shortest maturities possible. Assigned Receivables will only be assigned
and transferred to the New Issuer pursuant to this clause (A) in whole, and not in part;

(B) The cash proceeds from the repayment of Interest Facility Loans (to be demanded by the
Issuer or the Administrator on behalf of the Issuer) in an amount equal to (a) minus (b);
where (a) is the accrued and unpaid interest that remained outstanding on the Assigned
Receivables assigned pursuant to clause (A) above as of the immediately preceding Interest
Payment Date, and (b) is any accrued and unpaid Retained Amount Interest that remained
outstanding as of the Determination Date in respect of the Retained Amounts to be
transferred to the New Issuer pursuant to clause (D) below, as applicable;

(C) The cash proceeds from the repayment of Excess Cash Loans (to be demanded by the Issuer
or the Administrator on behalf of the Issuer) in an amount equal to (a) minus (b) minus (c),

177


-----

where (a) is the Committed Principal Proceeds multiplied by the Relevant Percentage, (b) is
the aggregate Purchase Price Amounts of Assigned Receivables assigned to the New Issuer
pursuant to clause (A) above, and (c) is any Interim Platform Amounts to be credited to the
Issuer on the Determination Date;

(D) The cash proceeds from the payment by the Platform Provider to the Issuer on the
Determination Date of any Retained Amounts and any other Interim Platform Amounts; and

(E) An “Accrued Facility Interest and Shortfall Amount” equal to (a) minus (b) minus
(c) minus (d) minus (e), where (a) is the aggregate principal amount of Notes tendered into
the Approved Exchange Offer, (b) is the aggregate Purchase Price Amounts of the Assigned
Receivables assigned pursuant to clause (A) above plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon
through the Determination Date, (c) is the amount of cash proceeds set out in clause
(B) above, (d) is the amount of cash proceeds set out in clause (C) above and (e) is the
amount of cash proceeds set out in clause (D) above. The Issuer will demand repayment of
Excess Cash Loans in an amount equal to any Accrued Facility Interest and Shortfall Amount
in order to make such payment.

_Cancellation_

(m) All Notes redeemed under this Condition 6 (Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation; Approved
_Exchange Offer) or otherwise surrendered under Condition 18 (Replacement of Notes) will be cancelled_
upon redemption or surrender and may not be resold or re-issued.

_Limited Recourse_

(n) Notwithstanding any other provision of these Conditions or the other Transaction Documents:

(i) the Noteholders will only have recourse in respect of any amount, claim or obligation due or
owing under the Notes by the Issuer (the “Claims”) to the extent of available funds pursuant to
Condition 3(f) (Status, Priority and Security—Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments) and subject
to the provisos in such Conditions, which shall be applied by the Security Trustee subject to and in
accordance with the terms thereof and after all other prior ranking claims in respect thereof have
been satisfied and discharged in full;

(ii) following the application of funds following enforcement of the security interests created under
the Trust Deed and any other Notes Security Documents, subject to and in accordance with
Condition 3(f) (Status, Priority and Security—Post-Enforcement Priority of Payments), the Issuer
will have no assets available for payment of its obligations under the Notes, the Trust Deed and
the other Transaction Documents other than as provided for pursuant to the Trust Deed, and that
the Claims of the Noteholders will accordingly be extinguished to the extent of any shortfall (and
the Notes shall be surrendered in accordance with Condition 7 (Payments) and cancelled in
accordance with Condition 6 (m) (Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation; Approved Exchange
_Offer—Cancellation); and_

(iii) the respective obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Trust Deed, and the other Transaction
Documents will not be obligations or responsibilities of, or guaranteed by, any other person or
entity.

7. **Payments**

_Payment of Principal, Interest and Other Amounts_

(a) Payments to Noteholders shall be made ratably among the Noteholders in the proportion that the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes registered in the name of each such Noteholder on the
applicable Record Date bears to the aggregate principal amount outstanding of all Notes on such
Record Date.

(b) All reductions in the principal amount of a Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) effected by
payments of instalments of principal made on any Interest Payment Date on which a Note is redeemed
shall be binding upon all future holders of such Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of
transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof, whether or not such payment is noted on such
Note.

178


-----

(c) Subject to the foregoing, each Note delivered under the Trust Deed, and upon registration of transfer of
or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Note, shall carry the rights to unpaid interest and principal (or
other applicable amount) that were carried by such other Note.

_Currency of Payment_

(d) Payments in respect of the Notes will be made in euro.

_Payments subject to the Trust Deed and all Fiscal Laws_

(e) Payments of principal, interest and other amounts (if any) in respect of the Notes are subject in all
cases to the Priorities of Payments and the Trust Deed and to any fiscal or other laws and regulations
applicable thereto.

_Payment of Interest on Withheld Amounts_

(f) If payment of principal on or in respect of any Note or part thereof is not made when due or is
otherwise improperly withheld or refused, the interest which continues to accrue in respect of such
Note in accordance with Condition 5(a) (Interest—Period of Accrual) will become due and payable on
the date on which the payment of such principal is paid.

_Paying Agents_

(g) The initial Paying Agent and its specified office is set out at the end of these Conditions. The Issuer
reserves the right, subject to the prior written approval of the Notes Trustee, at any time to vary or
terminate the appointment of the Paying Agent and to appoint additional or other paying agents. Upon
being notified of the same by the relevant Agent, the Issuer shall promptly give notice of any change in
an Agent’s specified office to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 19 (Notices and
_Information)._

_Payments on Business Days_

(h) If any Note is presented for payment on a day which is not a Business Day in the place of presentation,
then the holder shall not be entitled to payment in such place until the next succeeding Business Day in
such place and no further payment or additional amount by way of interest, principal or otherwise shall
be due in respect of such Note.

_Entitlement to Payments_

(i) Payments on the Notes will be made to the person in whose name the Note is registered on the Record
Date. Payments on interests in notes not in global form will be made in euro by wire transfer, in
accordance with the information on the Register, in immediately available funds to the Noteholder,
_provided that wiring instructions have been provided to the Paying Agent on or before the related_
Record Date. Final payments in respect of principal on the Notes will be made only against surrender
of the Notes at the office of the Paying Agent.

(j) Payments on any Global Notes will be made by the Issuer to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent will,
in turn, make such payments to the common depository for Euroclear and/or Clearstream which will
distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their respective procedures. None of the
Issuer, the Notes Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar or the Transfer Agent will have any
responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of
beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records
relating to the beneficial ownership interests. The Issuer also expects that payments by participants to
owners of beneficial interests in a Global Note held through the participants will be governed by
standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts
of customers registered in the names of nominees for the customers. The payments will be the
responsibility of the participants.

179


-----

8. **Prescription**

_General_

(a) After the date on which a Note becomes void in its entirety, no claim may be made in respect of it.

_Principal_

(b) Claims for payment of principal or Additional Amounts, if any, in respect of Notes shall become void
unless the relevant Note(s) are presented or surrendered for payment within ten years of the Relevant
Date. Any funds deposited with the Notes Trustee or the Paying Agent for the payment of principal
remaining unclaimed for ten years after such principal has become due and payable shall be paid to the
Issuer pursuant to the Trust Deed; and the Noteholder shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor,
look only to the Issuer for payment of such amounts and all liability of the Notes Trustee and the
Paying Agent with respect to such trust funds shall thereupon cease.

As used herein, “Relevant Date” means whichever is the later of (i) the date on which such payment
first becomes due and (ii) if the full amount payable has not been received by the Paying Agent or the
Notes Trustee on or prior to such due date, the date on which, the full amount plus any accrued interest
having been so received, notice to that effect shall have been given to the Noteholders in accordance
with Condition 19 (Notices and Information).

_Interest_

(c) Claims for interest in respect of Notes shall become void unless the relevant Note(s) is presented or
surrendered for payment within five years of the Relevant Date. Any funds deposited with the Notes
Trustee or the Paying Agent for the payment of interest remaining unclaimed for five years after such
principal or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Issuer pursuant to the Trust Deed;
and the Noteholder shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Issuer for
payment of such amounts and all liability of the Notes Trustee and the Paying Agent with respect to
such trust funds shall thereupon cease.

9. **Taxation**

_Gross Up for Deduction or Withholding_

(a) Subject to the proviso below, all payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest in respect of the
Notes shall be made free and clear of, and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, taxes
unless such withholding or deduction is required by law or by the official interpretation or
administration thereof. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any taxes imposed or
levied by or on behalf of:

(i) the government of the Netherlands or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof
or therein having power to tax;

(ii) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on the Notes is made, or any political subdivision
or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax; or

(iii) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor (as defined below) is organized or otherwise considered to
be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or
therein having the power to tax (each of clause (i), (ii) and (iii), a “Relevant Taxing
**Jurisdiction”),**

the Issuer or any successor thereto (a “Payor”) shall pay such additional amounts (the “Additional
**Amounts”) as will result in the receipt by the Noteholders of such amounts as would have been**
received by them if no such withholding or deduction had been required but only to the extent and only
at such time as the Issuer receives an equivalent amount from VFZG under the Expenses Agreement.
To the extent that the Issuer receives a lesser amount from VFZG, the Issuer will account to each
Noteholder for an additional amount equivalent to a pro rata proportion of such amount (if any) as is
actually received (after deduction or withholding of such taxes or duties as may be required to be made
by the Issuer by law in respect of the Notes) by, or for the account of, the Issuer pursuant to the
Expenses Agreement on the date of the payment of such amount to the Issuer, provided that no such
Additional Amount will be payable in respect of:

(i) any taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant Noteholder or beneficial owner and the Relevant Taxing

180


-----

Jurisdiction imposing such taxes (other than the mere ownership or holding of such Note or
enforcement of rights thereunder or under the Trust Deed or the receipt of payments in respect
thereof);

(ii) any taxes that would not have been so imposed if the Noteholder had made a declaration of
non-residence or any other claim or filing for exemption to which it is entitled (provided that
(i) such declaration of non-residence or other claim or filing for exemption is required by the
applicable law of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from the
requirement to deduct or withhold all or a part of any such taxes and (ii) at least 30 days prior to
the first payment date with respect to which such declaration of non-residence or other claim or
filing for exemption is required under the applicable law of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, the
relevant holder at that time has been notified (in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
Trust Deed) by the Payor or any other person through whom payment may be made that a
declaration of non-residence or other claim or filing for exemption is required to be made, but
only to the extent the holder is legally entitled to provide such declaration, claim or filing);

(iii) any Note presented for payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the
relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Noteholder (except to the extent that
the holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented during
such 30-day period);

(iv) any taxes that are payable otherwise than by withholding from a payment of the principal of,
premium, if any, or interest on the Notes;

(v) any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other
governmental charge;

(vi) all United States backup withholding;

(vii) any withholding or deduction imposed pursuant to (i) Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended), as of the Issue Date (or any amended or successor
version that is substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with) and any
current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof, (ii) any treaty, law, regulation or
other official guidance enacted in any other jurisdiction, or relating to an intergovernmental
agreement between the United States and any other jurisdiction, which (in either case) facilitates
the implementation of (i) above, or (iii) any agreement pursuant to the implementation of (i) or (ii)
above with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. government or any governmental or
taxation authority in any other jurisdiction; or

(viii) any combination of items (i) through (vii) above.

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable where, had the beneficial owner of the Note been
the holder, it would not have been entitled to payment of Additional Amounts by reason of any of
clauses (i) to (viii) inclusive above.

(b) The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted
or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use
all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any taxes so
deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such taxes and will provide
such certified copies (or, if certified copies are not available despite reasonable efforts of the Payor,
other evidence of payment reasonably satisfactory to the Notes Trustee) to each Noteholder. The Payor
will attach to each certified copy (or other evidence) a certificate stating (a) that the amount of
withholding taxes evidenced by the certified copy was paid in connection with payments in respect of
the principal amount of Notes then outstanding and (b) the amount of such withholding taxes paid per
£1,000 principal amount of the Notes, as the case may be. Copies of such documentation will be
available for inspection during ordinary business hours at the office of the Paying Agent by the
Noteholders upon request.

(c) At least 30 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes is due and
payable (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises on or after the 30th day prior to such
date, in which case it shall be promptly thereafter), if the Payor will be obligated to pay Additional
Amounts with respect to such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Notes Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate (upon which the Notes Trustee shall be entitled to absolutely rely without further enquiry)
stating the fact that such Additional Amounts will be payable, the amounts so payable and will set forth
such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay such Additional Amounts to

181


-----

Noteholders on the payment date. Each such Officer’s Certificate shall be relied upon until receipt of a
further Officer’s Certificate addressing such matters. The Notes Trustee shall be entitled to rely
absolutely and without further enquiry on each such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such
payments are necessary.

(d) Wherever mentioned in the Trust Deed, the Notes or these Conditions, in any context: (i) the payment
of principal, (ii) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes, (iii) interest, or (iv) any other
amount payable on or with respect to the Notes, such reference shall be deemed to include payment of
Additional Amounts as described under this heading to the extent that, in such context, Additional
Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

(e) The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes or any other excise or
property taxes, charges or similar levies (including interest and penalties to the extent resulting from a
failure by the Issuer to timely pay amounts due) which arise in any jurisdiction from the execution,
delivery or registration of any Notes or any other document or instrument referred to therein (other than
a transfer of the Notes), or the receipt of any payments with respect to the Notes, excluding any such
taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by any jurisdiction that is not a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction or
any jurisdiction in which a Paying Agent is located, other than those resulting from, or required to be
paid in connection with, the enforcement of the Notes, the Notes Collateral or any other such document
or instrument following the delivery of an Enforcement Notice with respect to the Notes.

(f) The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Trust Deed and
the Notes and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is
organized or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

_Tax Characterisation_

(g) The Issuer intends to treat, and the Trust Deed will provide that the Issuer and the Notes Trustee agree
and each Noteholder and beneficial owner of Notes, by accepting a Note, agrees, to the extent
permitted by law, to treat the Notes as debt instruments of the Issuer for U.S. federal, state and local
income and franchise tax purposes. The Trust Deed will provide that each Noteholder, by accepting a
Note, agrees to report all income (or loss) in accordance with such treatment and to take no action
inconsistent with such treatment unless otherwise required by a law or relevant taxing authority.

10. Issuer Events of Default

_Determination of an Issuer Event of Default_

(a) The Notes Trustee:

(i) may in its absolute discretion; and

(ii) shall if it has been directed to do so:

(A) in writing by the holders of not less than 30 per cent. in aggregate of the principal amount
outstanding of the Notes; or

(B) by an Extraordinary Resolution of the Noteholders,

subject in each case to being indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction, give a notice (a “Note
**Acceleration Notice”) to the Issuer declaring the Notes to be immediately due and payable at any**
time after the occurrence and during the continuation of any of the events specified in Condition
10(b) (Issuer Events of Default— Events).

_Events_

(b) The occurrence of any of the following events shall be an “Issuer Event of Default”:

(i) default being made for a period of 30 days or more in the payment of any interest or Additional
Amounts (if any) on any Notes (other than principal, for the avoidance of doubt) when due; or

(ii) default being made for a period of three Business Days or more in the payment of any principal of
any Notes when due (at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise); or

(iii) the Issuer failing duly to perform or observe any other obligation binding upon it under the Notes,
the Trust Deed or any of the other Transaction Documents and such failure (A) being in the

182


-----

opinion of the Notes Trustee (or, in the case of any Notes Security Document, the Security
Trustee) incapable of remedy or (B) being a failure which is, in the opinion of the Notes Trustee
(or, in the case of any Notes Security Document, the Security Trustee), capable of remedy, but
which remains unremedied for a period of 60 days following the giving by the Notes Trustee (or
the Security Trustee, as applicable), to the Issuer of notice requiring the same to be remedied and,
in either case, provided that, in each case, the Notes Trustee shall have determined that such event
is, in its opinion, materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders; or

(iv) the Issuer ceasing or, through an official action of the Board of Directors of the Issuer, threatening
to cease to carry on business; or

(v) any of the following occurs with respect to the Issuer:

(A) it is, or is deemed for the purposes of any law to be, unable to pay its debts as they fall due or
insolvent; or

(B) it admits its inability to pay its debts as they fall due; or it suspends making payments on any
of its debts or announces an intention to do so; or

(C) proceedings are initiated against the Issuer under any applicable liquidation, insolvency,
bankruptcy, composition, reorganisation or other similar laws (together, “Insolvency Law”), or
a receiver, administrative receiver, trustee, administrator, examiner, custodian, conservator,
liquidator, curator or other similar official appointed in connection with any Insolvency Law or
a security enforcement or related proceedings (a “Receiver”) is appointed in relation to the
Issuer or in relation to the whole or any substantial part of the undertaking or assets of the
Issuer and in any of the foregoing cases, except in relation to the appointment of a Receiver, is
not discharged within 30 calendar days; or the Issuer is subject to, or initiates or consents to
judicial proceedings relating to itself under any applicable Insolvency Law, or seeks the
appointment of a Receiver, or makes a conveyance or assignment for the benefit of its creditors
generally or otherwise becomes subject to any reorganisation or amalgamation; or

(D) the passing of an effective resolution or the making of an order by a court of competent
jurisdiction for the winding up, liquidation or dissolution of the Issuer;

(vii) the Issuer Security (or any material part thereof) is repudiated or is or becomes void, illegal,
invalid or unenforceable; or

(viii) the occurrence of a VFZ Event of Default that is continuing.

For so long as any Issuer Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, no further purchases of VFZ
Accounts Receivable shall be made by or for the account of the Issuer. In addition, pursuant to Clause
4.2 of the New VFZ Facilities Agreement, an Issuer Event of Default would result in New VFZ
Facilities Borrower no longer satisfying the conditions precedent to further utilisations of the facilities
made available thereunder.

_Acceleration_

(c) Upon delivery of a Note Acceleration Notice, the Notes shall immediately become due and payable at
their principal amount outstanding together with accrued interest up to (but excluding) the earlier of
(i) the date on which the full amount (together with accrued interest) is paid to the Noteholders and
(ii) the seventh day after notice has been given to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 19
(Notices and Information) that the full amount (together with accrued interest) has been received by the
Paying Agent or the Notes Trustee; provided that upon the occurrence of an Issuer Event of Default
described in clause (v) or (vi) of the definition thereof, the Note Acceleration Notice shall be deemed to
have been given and all the Notes shall become immediately due and payable.

11. Enforcement

(a) At any time:

(i) after a Note Acceleration Notice has been given (or deemed to have been given) to the Issuer, the
Notes Trustee:

(A) may in its absolute discretion; and

183


-----

(B) shall if it has been directed to do so:

Extraordinary Resolution of the Noteholders or by the holders of not less than 30 per cent. in aggregate
of the principal amount outstanding of the Notes (in accordance with Condition 12(c) (Noteholder

Trustee, as applicable; provided that the Notes Trustee and/or Security Trustee, as applicable, shall not
be obliged to agree to any modification which, in the opinion of the Notes Trustee and/or Security

-----

**FORM OF THE NOTES**

**General**

**_Denominations_**

(a) The Notes will have a minimum authorized denomination of €100,000 principal amount and integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

**_Form and Registration_**

(b) The Notes will be sold only to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S and
will be issued in the form of one or more permanent global notes in fully registered form without interest
coupons (each a “Regulation S Global Note”, and together with the global notes representing the
Rule 144A Global Notes (as defined below), the “Global Notes”)

(c) Each initial investor in the Notes and subsequent transferee of an interest in a Global Note (except, in the
case of an Initial Purchaser, as may be expressly agreed in writing between such Initial Purchaser and the
Issuer) will be deemed to represent, among other matters, as to its status under the U.S. Securities Act and
the Investment Company Act and ERISA, as applicable.

(d) As used herein, “U.S. person” shall have the meanings assigned to such term in each of Regulation S and
the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. The term “offshore transaction” shall have the meaning assigned to such
term in Regulation S.

(e) The Global Notes will be deposited with and registered in the name of a common depository for the
respective accounts of Euroclear and/or Clearstream. The Common Codes and ISIN for the Notes are as
follows:

**Rule 144A Global Note**

Common Code:

ISIN:

**Regulation S Global Note**

Common Code:

ISIN:

(f) A beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of an interest in the corresponding global notes representing the Notes sold pursuant to Rule 144A (the
“Rule 144A Global Notes”) only upon, in accordance with the applicable procedures of the Clearing
Systems, expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period and receipt by the Transfer Agent of (i) a written
certification from the transferor in the form required by the Trust Deed to the effect that such transfer is
being made to a person whom the transferor reasonably believes is both a QIB and a Qualified Purchaser (or
a transferee thereof that is identified in Rules 3c-5 or 3c-6 under the Investment Company Act) in a
transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A and Section 3(c)(7) under the Investment Company Act,
respectively, in compliance with certain restrictions imposed during the 40-day period prescribed by
Regulation S commencing on the later of (a) the date upon which Notes are first offered to persons other
than the Initial Purchasers and any other distributor (as such term is defined in Regulation S) of the Notes
and (b) the Issue Date (the “Distribution Compliance Period”), if applicable, and in accordance with any
applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction and (ii) a written
certification from the transferee in the form required by the Trust Deed to the effect, among other things,
that such transferee is both (x) a QIB and (y) a Qualified Purchaser (or a transferee thereof that is identified
in Rules 3c-5 or 3c-6 under the Investment Company Act). Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note
may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Regulation S Global Note
only upon receipt by the Transfer Agent of a written certification from the transferor in the form required by
the Trust Deed to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S and a written
certification from the transferee in the form required by the Trust Deed to the effect, inter alia, that such
transferee is a non-U.S. person purchasing such beneficial interest in such Regulation S Global Note in an
offshore transaction pursuant to Regulation S. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in another Global Note will, upon
transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Note, and become an interest in such other Global Note, and
accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to
beneficial interests in such other Global Notes for as long as it remains such an interest.

192


-----

(g) No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes but the Issuer, the
Registrar or the Transfer Agent may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer, tax or other
governmental charge payable in connection therewith. The Registrar or the Transfer Agent will be permitted
to request such evidence reasonably satisfactory to it documenting the identity and/or signatures of the
transferor and transferee.

(h) The registered owner of the relevant Global Note will be the only person entitled to receive payments in
respect of the Notes represented thereby, and the Issuer will be discharged by payment to the registered
owner of such Global Note or in respect of each amount so paid. No person other than the registered owner
of the relevant Global Note will have any claim against the Issuer in respect of any payment due on that
Global Note. Account holders or participants in Euroclear and/or Clearstream shall have no rights under the
Trust Deed with respect to Global Notes held on their behalf by Euroclear and/or Clearstream, and
Euroclear and/or Clearstream may be treated by the Issuer, the Notes Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or
the Notes Trustee as the holder of Global Notes for all purposes whatsoever.

(i) Global Notes will be exchangeable by the Issuer for Definitive Notes if: (i) Euroclear and/or Clearstream
notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depository for the Global Notes and a
successor depository is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days after receiving such notice; (ii) the
Issuer, at its option, notifies the Notes Trustee in writing that it elects to exchange in whole, but not in part,
the Global Note for Definitive Notes; (iii) Euroclear and/or Clearstream so request following an Issuer
Event of Default which is continuing; or (iv) the holder of a beneficial interest in a Global Note requests
such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear and/or Clearstream or to the Issuer following an
Issuer Event of Default which is continuing.

Upon the occurrence of any of the preceding events in clauses (i) through (iv) above, the Issuer shall issue
or cause to be issued Definitive Notes in such name or names and issued in any approved denominations as
Euroclear or Clearstream shall instruct the Issuer based on the instructions received by Euroclear or
Clearstream from the holders of beneficial interests in such Global Notes.

In the event that Definitive Notes are not so issued by the Issuer to such beneficial owners of interests in
Global Notes, the Issuer expressly acknowledges that such beneficial owners shall be entitled to pursue any
remedy that the holders of a Global Note would be entitled to pursue in accordance with the Trust Deed (but
only to the extent of such beneficial owner’s interest in the Global Note) as if Definitive Notes had been
issued; provided, that the Notes Trustee shall be entitled to rely upon any certificate of ownership provided
by such beneficial owners and/or other forms of reasonable evidence of such ownership. In the event that
Definitive Notes are issued in exchange for Global Notes as described above, the applicable Global Note
will be surrendered to the Registrar by Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and the Issuer will
execute and the Registrar will authenticate and deliver an equal aggregate outstanding principal amount of
Definitive Notes.

(j) The Notes will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer set forth therein and in the Trust Deed and the
Notes will bear the restrictive legend set forth in “Transfer Restrictions”.

**_Bloomberg Screens, Etc._**

(k) The Issuer will from time to time request all third-party vendors to include on screens maintained by such
vendors appropriate legends regarding restrictions on the Global Notes under Section 3(c)(7) of the
Investment Company Act and Rule 144A, if applicable.

Purchasers or any Agent party to the Agency and Account Bank Agreement (or any affiliate of any of the above,
or any person by whom any of the above is controlled for the purposes of the U.S. Securities Act), will have any
responsibility for the performance by the Clearing Systems or their respective direct or indirect participants or
accountholders of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations or for
the sufficiency for any purpose of the arrangements described below.

**Euroclear and Clearstream**

Custodial and depository links have been established between Euroclear and Clearstream to facilitate the
initial issue of the Notes and cross–market transfers of the Notes associated with secondary market trading (see
“Settlement and Transfer of Notes” below). The Issuer provides the following summary of those operations and
procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are
controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers
are responsible for those operations or procedures.

Euroclear and Clearstream each hold securities for their customers and facilitate the clearance and
settlement of securities transactions through electronic book-entry transfer between their respective
accountholders. Indirect access to Euroclear and/or Clearstream is available to other institutions which clear
through or maintain a custodial relationship with an accountholder of either system. Euroclear and Clearstream
provide various services including safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally traded
securities and securities lending and borrowing. Euroclear and Clearstream also deal with domestic securities
markets in several countries through established depository and custodial relationships. Euroclear and
Clearstream have established an electronic bridge between their two systems across which their respective
customers may settle trades with each other. Their customers are worldwide financial institutions including
underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations. Investors may
hold their interests in such Global Notes directly through Euroclear and/or Clearstream if they are accountholders
(“Direct Participants”) or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”, and together with Direct Participants,
“Participants”) through organizations which are accountholders therein.

**Book-Entry Ownership**

**_Euroclear and Clearstream_**

The Regulation S Global Note and the Rule 144A Global Note will each have an ISIN and a Common Code and
will be registered in the name of, and deposited with, a common depository on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

**_Relationship of Participants with Clearing Systems_**

Each of the persons shown in the records of Euroclear and/or Clearstream as a Noteholder represented by a
Global Note must look solely to Euroclear and/or Clearstream (as the case may be) for his share of each payment
made by the Issuer to the holder of such Global Note and in relation to all other rights arising under the Global
Note, subject to and in accordance with the respective rules and procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream. The
Issuer expects that, upon receipt of any payment in respect of Notes represented by a Global Note, the common
depository by whom such Note is held, or nominee in whose name it is registered, will immediately credit the
relevant Participants’ or accountholders’ accounts in the relevant Clearing System with payments in amounts
proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the relevant Global Note as shown
on the records of the relevant Clearing System or its nominee. The Issuer also expects that payments by Direct
Participants in any Clearing System to owners of beneficial interests in any Global Note held through such Direct
Participants in any Clearing System will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices. Save as
aforesaid, such persons shall have no claim directly against the Issuer in respect of payments due on the Notes for
so long as the Notes are represented by such Global Note and the obligations of the Issuer will be discharged by
payment to the registered holder, as the case may be, of such Global Note in respect of each amount so paid.
None of the Issuer, the Notes Trustee or any Agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the
records relating to or payments made on account of ownership interests in any Global Note or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing any records relating to such ownership interests.

194


-----

**_Settlement and Transfer of Notes_**

Subject to the rules and procedures of each applicable Clearing System, purchases of Notes held within a
Clearing System must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for such Notes on
the Clearing System’s records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each such Note (the
“Beneficial Owner”) will in turn be recorded on the Direct Participant and Indirect Participant’s records.
Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from any Clearing System of their purchase, but
Beneficial Owners are expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as
periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct Participant or Indirect Participant through which such
Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in Notes held within the Clearing
System will be effected by entries made on the books of Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners.
Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in such Notes, unless and
until interests in any Global Note held within a Clearing System are exchanged for Definitive Notes.

No Clearing System has knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Notes held within such Clearing
System and their records will reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such Notes are
credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Participants will remain responsible for keeping
account of their holdings on behalf of their customers. Conveyance of notices and other communications by the
Clearing Systems to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants
and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any
statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time.

**_Trading between Euroclear and/or Clearstream Participants_**

Secondary market sales of book-entry interests in the Notes held through Euroclear and/or Clearstream to
purchasers of book-entry interests in the Notes held through Euroclear and/or Clearstream will be conducted in
accordance with the normal rules and operating procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and will be settled
using the procedures applicable to conventional Eurobonds.

**_Redemption of Global Notes_**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the Beneficial
Owner of book-entry interests in such Global Note, subject to any applicable withholding taxes. The redemption
price payable in connection with the redemption of such book-entry interests will be equal to the amount
received by Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note
(or any portion thereof), subject to any applicable withholding taxes. The Issuer understands that under existing
practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear
and/or Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments
to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that
no book-entry interest of less than €100,000 in principal amount at maturity, or less, may be redeemed in part.

**_Payments on Global Notes_**

Payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest,
additional interest and additional amounts) will be made by the Issuer to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent
will, in turn, make such payments to Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to
participants in accordance with their respective procedures.

Under the terms of the Trust Deed, the Issuer, the Trustee the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and the Paying
Agent will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (for example Euroclear or Clearstream) as the owner
thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the
Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent nor the Paying Agents or any of their respective agents has or will have
any responsibility or liability for:

    - any aspects of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to
or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments made by Euroclear or
Clearstream, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear or Clearstream, or
payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, or

    - payments made by Euroclear or Clearstream, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records
of Euroclear or Clearstream or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest, or

195


-----

    - Euroclear or Clearstream; or

    - the records of the common depositary or the custodian.

Payments made by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers
registered in “street name”.

**_Currency and Payment for the Global Notes_**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of the Global
Notes will be paid to holders of interest in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro.

**_Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests_**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a
Noteholder only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account book-entry interests in the Global
Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes as to which
such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any
discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes.
However, if there is an Issuer Event of Default under the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the
right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Notes in certificated form, and to distribute such Definitive
Notes to their respective participants.

**TAXATION**

**THE NETHERLANDS**

This summary solely addresses the principal Dutch tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and
disposal of Notes and does not purport to describe every aspect of taxation that may be relevant to a particular
Noteholder. Tax matters are complex, and the tax consequences of the issuance of the Notes to a particular holder
of Notes will depend in part on such holder’s circumstances. Accordingly, a holder is urged to consult their own
tax advisor for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the issuance of the Notes to them, including the
applicability and effect of Dutch tax laws.

Where in this summary English terms and expressions are used to refer to Dutch concepts, the meaning to
be attributed to such terms and expressions shall be the meaning to be attributed to the equivalent Dutch concepts
under Dutch tax law. Where in this summary the terms “the Netherlands” and “Dutch” are used, these refer
solely to the European part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. This summary assumes that the Issuer is
organized, and that its business will be conducted, in the manner outlined in this Offering Circular. A change to
such organizational structure or to the manner in which the Issuer conducts its business may invalidate the
contents of this summary, which will not be updated to reflect any such change.

This summary is based on the tax law of the Netherlands (unpublished case law not included) as it stands at
the date of this Offering Circular. The tax law upon which this summary is based, is subject to changes, possibly
with retroactive effect. Any such change may invalidate the contents of this summary, which will not be updated
to reflect such change.

The summary in this “the Netherlands” taxation paragraph does not address the Dutch tax consequences for
a holder of Notes who:

(i) is a person who may be deemed an owner of Notes for Dutch tax purposes pursuant to specific
statutory attribution rules in Dutch tax law;

(ii) is, although in principle subject to Dutch corporate income tax, in whole or in part, specifically exempt
from that tax in connection with income from Notes;

(iii) is an investment institution as defined in the Dutch Corporation Tax Act 1969 and other entities that are
exempt from Dutch corporate income tax;

(iv) owns Notes in connection with a membership of a management board or a supervisory board, an
employment relationship, a deemed employment relationship or management role;

(v) has a substantial interest in the Issuer or a deemed substantial interest in the Issuer for Dutch tax
purposes. Generally, a person holds a substantial interest if (a) such person—either alone or, in the case
of an individual, together with his partner or any of his relatives by blood or by marriage in the direct
line (including foster-children) or of those of his partner for Dutch tax purposes—owns or is deemed to
own, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the shares or of any class of shares of the Issuer, or rights to
acquire, directly or indirectly, such an interest in the shares of the Issuer or profit participating
certificates relating to 5% or more of the annual profits or to 5% or more of the liquidation proceeds of
the Issuer, or (b) such person’s shares, rights to acquire shares or profit participating certificates in the
Issuer are held by him following the application of a non-recognition provision; or

(vi) is a corporate entity or taxable as a corporate entity and who is resident or deemed to be resident of
Aruba, Curaçao or Sint Maarten for tax purposes.

**_Withholding tax_**

All payments under the Notes may be made free from withholding or deduction of or for any taxes of
whatever nature imposed, levied, withheld or assessed by the Netherlands or any political subdivision or taxing
authority of or in the Netherlands.

**_Taxes on income and capital gains_**

**Resident holders of Notes**

A holder of Notes who is resident or deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for Dutch tax purposes is
fully subject to Dutch income tax if they are an individual, or fully subject to Dutch corporation tax if it is a
corporate entity, or an entity, including an association, a partnership and a mutual fund, taxable as a corporate
entity, as described in the summary below.

197


-----

_Individuals deriving profits or deemed to be deriving profits from an enterprise_

Any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from or in connection with Notes that are attributable to an
enterprise from which an individual derives profits, whether as an entrepreneur or pursuant to a co-entitlement to
the net value of an enterprise, other than as a shareholder, are generally subject to Dutch income tax at
progressive rates up to 51.75%.

_Individuals deriving benefits from miscellaneous activities_

Any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from or in connection with Notes that constitute benefits from
miscellaneous activities by an individual are generally subject to Dutch income tax at progressive rates up to
51.75%.

An individual may, inter alia, derive or be deemed to derive benefits from or in connection with Notes that
are taxable as benefits from miscellaneous activities if his investment activities go beyond regular active
portfolio management.

_Other individuals_

If a holder of Notes is an individual whose situation has not been discussed before in this section “Taxation—
_The Netherlands—Taxes on income and capital gains—Resident holders of Notes”, the value of their Notes forms_
part of the yield basis for purposes of tax on benefits from savings and investments. A deemed benefit, which is
determined on the basis of progressive rates starting from 1.94% up to 5.60% per annum (2019 rates) of this yield
basis, is taxed at the rate of 30% insofar as the individual’s yield basis exceeds a statutory threshold (heffingvrij
_vermogen). Actual benefits derived from or in connection with their Notes are not subject to Dutch income tax._

_Corporate entities_

Any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from or in connection with Notes that are held by a corporate
entity, or an entity, including an association, a partnership and a mutual fund, taxable as a corporate entity, are
generally subject to Dutch corporate income tax.

_General_

A holder of Notes will not be deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for Dutch tax purposes by reason
only of the execution and/or enforcement of the documents relating to the issue of Notes or the performance by
the Issuer of its obligations under such documents or under the Notes.

**Non-resident holders of Notes**

_Individuals_

If a holder of Notes is an individual who is neither resident nor deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for
purposes of Dutch income tax, they will not be subject to Dutch income tax in respect of any benefits derived or
deemed to be derived from or in connection with Notes, except if:

(i) they derive profits from an enterprise, whether as an entrepreneur or pursuant to a co-entitlement to the
net value of such enterprise, other than as a shareholder, and such enterprise is carried on, in whole or
in part, through a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in the Netherlands, and their
Notes are attributable to such permanent establishment or permanent representative; or

(ii) they derive benefits or are deemed to derive benefits from or in connection with Notes that are taxable
as benefits from miscellaneous activities performed in the Netherlands.

_Corporate entities_

If a holder of Notes is a corporate entity, or an entity, including an association, a partnership and a mutual
fund, taxable as a corporate entity, which is neither resident nor deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for
purposes of Dutch corporate income tax, it will not be subject to Dutch corporate income tax in respect of any
benefits derived or deemed to be derived from or in connection with Notes, except if:

(i) it derives profits from an enterprise directly which is carried on, in whole or in part, through a
permanent establishment or a permanent representative in the Netherlands, and to which permanent
establishment or permanent representative its Notes are attributable; or

198


-----

(ii) it derives profits pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net value of an enterprise which is managed in the
Netherlands, other than as a holder of securities, and to which enterprise its Notes are attributable.

_General_

If a holder of Notes is neither resident nor deemed to be resident in the Netherlands, such holder will for
Dutch tax purposes not carry on or be deemed to carry on an enterprise, in whole or in part, through a permanent
establishment or a permanent representative in the Netherlands by reason only of the execution and/or
enforcement of the documents relating to the issue of Notes or the performance by the Issuer of its obligations
under such documents or under the Notes.

**_Gift and inheritance taxes_**

No Dutch gift tax or Dutch inheritance tax will arise with respect to an acquisition or deemed acquisition of
Notes by way of gift by, or upon the death of, a holder of Notes who is neither resident nor deemed to be resident
in the Netherlands for purposes of Dutch gift tax or Dutch inheritance tax except if, in the event of a gift whilst
not being a resident nor being a deemed resident in the Netherlands for purposes of Dutch gift tax or Dutch
inheritance tax, the holder of Notes becomes a resident or a deemed resident in the Netherlands and dies within
180 days after the date of the gift.

For purposes of Dutch gift tax and Dutch inheritance tax, a gift of Notes made under a condition precedent
is deemed to be made at the time the condition precedent is satisfied.

**_Registration taxes and duties_**

No Dutch registration tax, transfer tax, stamp duty or any other similar documentary tax or duty, other than
court fees, is payable in the Netherlands in respect of or in connection with the execution and/or enforcement
(including by legal proceedings and including the enforcement of any foreign judgment in the courts of the
Netherlands) of the documents relating to the issue of Notes, the performance by the Issuer of its obligations
under such documents or under Notes, or the transfer of Notes, except that Dutch real property transfer tax may
be due upon an acquisition, in connection with Notes, of real property situated in the Netherlands, (an interest in)
an asset that qualifies as real property situated in the Netherlands, or (an interest in) a right over real property
situated in the Netherlands, for the purposes of Dutch real property transfer tax.

**_Information Exchange Regimes_**

On 9 December 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted a Directive (EC Council Directive
2014/107/EU amending EU Council Directive 2011/16/EU) which effectively implemented the OECD’s
common reporting standard on automatic exchange of financial account information in tax matters (the “CRS”).
EU member states were required to implement this Directive in respect of taxable periods from 1 January 2016
and exchange information pursuant to such Directive no later than 30 September 2017 (subject to deferral under
transitional rules in the case of Austria). The CRS is generally broader than the European Union Council
Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income (the “EU Savings Directive”), although it does not
impose withholding taxes.

The Netherlands has implemented the CRS into Dutch law. To comply with its obligations under the CRS
(or similar information sharing arrangements), the Issuer may require additional information and documentation
from Noteholders. The Issuer may disclose the information, certifications or other documentation that they
receive from or in relation to Noteholders to the Dutch tax authorities who may in turn exchange this information
with tax authorities in other territories. Each prospective investor should consult their own tax advisor on the
requirements.

On 10 November 2015, the Council of the European Union adopted EU Council Directive 2015/2060/EU
repealing the EU Savings Directive with effect from 1 January 2016 (or 1 January 2017 in the case of Austria),
subject to ongoing requirements to fulfil administrative obligations such as the reporting and exchange of
information relating to, and accounting for withholding taxes on, payments made before those dates. The repeal
of the EU Savings Directive is intended to prevent overlap between the EU Savings Directive and EC Council
Directive 2014/107/EU.

199


-----

**FATCA**

Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the U.S. Treasury and IRS guidance issued thereunder
(commonly referred to as “FATCA”) impose a 30% withholding tax on “withholdable payments”, including
“foreign passthru payments” made by a foreign financial institution, unless the foreign financial institution
complies with certain reporting rules under FATCA or otherwise qualifies for an exemption. Currently, the term
“foreign passthru payment” is not defined and it is unclear whether or to what extent payments on the Note
would be considered foreign passthru payments, assuming the issuer would be considered a foreign financial
institution. If and when such regulations are issued, the Notes will be considered grandfathered, and FATCA
should not apply to the Notes to the extent otherwise applicable. If, however, the Notes are modified more than
six months after the date final regulations defining a foreign passthru payment are published FATCA withholding
may apply (effective beginning two years from such date of publication) and holders and beneficial owners of the
Notes will not be entitled to receive any Additional Amounts to compensate for any such withholding. In
addition, if Further Notes are issued after the expiration of the grandfathering period and have the same ISIN as
the Notes issued hereby, then withholding agents may treat all notes bearing the same ISIN, including any Notes
issued hereby, as subject to withholding under FATCA. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the
availability of a refund in such circumstances. The intergovernmental agreement between the Netherlands and
the United States modified the requirements in this paragraph and an intergovernmental agreement between the
United States and another foreign country where a holder or intermediary is located may also modify the
requirements. Prospective holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of
FATCA on their investment in the Notes.

**THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX**

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

**The Notes are not eligible for purchase by or using the assets of a Benefit Plan Investor or any other**
**employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) which is subject to Similar Laws.**

Under ERISA and a regulation issued by the U.S. Department of Labor at 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as
modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA (the “Plan Asset Regulation”), the assets of an entity that is neither a
publicly-offered security nor a security issued by an investment company registered under the Investment
Company Act will be deemed to constitute “plan assets” for the purposes of ERISA and the Code if a Benefit
Plan Investor acquires an “equity interest” in the entity and none of the exceptions contained in the Plan Asset
Regulation is applicable. An equity interest is defined under the Plan Asset Regulation as an interest other than
an instrument which is treated as indebtedness under applicable local law and which has no substantial equity
features. Under the exceptions in the Plan Asset Regulation, an entity will not be deemed to hold plan assets if
(i) participation in the entity by Benefit Plan Investors is not “significant” (e.g., Benefit Plan Investors hold less
than 25% of each class of equity interest in the entity), or (ii) the entity is an operating company, including a
“venture capital operating company” or “real estate operating company”.

Although there is little guidance on the subject, at the time of their issuance, the Notes may be treated as
equity interests of the Issuer for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation. The Notes are not a publicly-offered
security and the Issuer is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act.
Furthermore, it is not expected that the Issuer will be an operating company for purposes of the Plan Asset
Regulations, and the Issuer will not be able to monitor the level of Benefit Plan Investor participation in the
Notes in order to maintain such participation below the 25% threshold. Therefore, there can be no guarantee that
the assets of the Issuer will not be deemed to include plan assets if the Notes were to be treated as equity interests
of the Issuer. Certain transactions involving the Issuer might be deemed to constitute prohibited transactions
under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or Similar Laws if the assets of the Issuer are deemed
to include plan assets under ERISA, the Code, or such Similar Laws. As a result, the Notes will not be made
available for purchase by Benefit Plan Investors or employee benefit plans (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of
ERISA) subject to Similar Laws, and any purchase of a Note by such a Benefit Plan Investor or employee benefit
plan will be null and void.

Each acquirer and each transferee of a Note or any interest therein will be deemed to have represented,
warranted and agreed at the time of its acquisition and throughout the period that it holds such Note or any
interest therein that it is not, and is not acting on behalf of (and for so long as such acquirer or transferee holds
such Notes or any interest therein will not be, and will not be acting on behalf of) a Benefit Plan Investor or an
employee benefit plan which is subject to Similar Laws, and no part of the assets used by it to acquire or hold any
Note or any interest therein constitutes the assets of any Benefit Plan Investor or any such employee benefit plan.

**Legal investment considerations**

If your investment activities are subject to regulation by federal, state or local law or governmental
authorities you should review the applicable laws and/or rules, policies and guidelines adopted from time to time
by such authorities before purchasing any Notes. No representation is made as to the proper characterisation of
the Notes for legal investment or other purposes or as to the ability of particular investors to purchase any Notes
under applicable law or other legal investment restrictions. Accordingly, if your investment activities are subject
to such laws and/or regulations, regulatory capital requirements or review by regulatory authorities you should
consult your own legal advisers in determining whether and to what extent the Notes constitute a legal
investment or are subject to investment, capital or other restrictions.

None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, VodafoneZiggo, VodafoneZiggo Group Holding B.V., Liberty
Global Europe Holding II B.V., Liberty Global, Vodafone, Vodafone International or any person who controls
them or any director, officer, employee or agent of any of theirs or affiliate of any such person make any
representation as to the proper characterisation of the Notes for legal investment or other purposes, as to the
ability of particular investors to purchase the Notes for legal investment or other purposes or as to the ability of
particular investors to purchase the Notes under applicable investment restrictions. All institutions whose
activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, regulatory capital requirements or review by
regulatory authorities should consult their own legal advisers in determining whether and to what extent the
Notes are subject to investment, capital or other restrictions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, VodafoneZiggo, VodafoneZiggo Group Holding B.V., Liberty Global
Europe Holding II B.V., Liberty Global, Vodafone, Vodafone International or any person who controls them or

201


-----

any director, officer, employee or agent of any of theirs or affiliate of any such person makes any representation
as to the characterisation of the Notes as a U.S.-domestic or foreign (non-U.S.) investment under any state
insurance code or related regulations, and they are not aware of any published precedent that addresses such
characterisation. The uncertainties described above (and any unfavorable future determinations concerning legal
investment or financial institution regulatory characteristics of the Notes) may affect the liquidity of the Notes.

the Initial Purchasers are entitled in certain circumstances to be released and discharged from their obligations
under the Subscription Agreement prior to the closing of the issuance of the Notes. In the Subscription
Agreement, VodafoneZiggo and the Issuer each agree to indemnify each of the Initial Purchasers against certain
liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, or to contribute to payments each Initial
Purchaser may be required to make in respect thereof.

**Selling Restrictions**

**_European Economic Area_**

In relation to each member state of the EEA (each, a “Member State”), each Initial Purchaser has
represented and agreed that it has not made and will not make an offer of Notes which are the subject of the
offering contemplated by this offering circular to the public in that Member State other than:

(a) to any legal entity which is a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation;

(b) to fewer than 150 natural or legal persons (other than qualified investors as defined in the Prospectus
Regulation), as permitted under the Prospectus Regulation, subject to obtaining the prior consent of the
relevant Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers nominated by the Issuer for any such offer; or

(c) in any other circumstances falling within Article 1(4) of the Prospectus Regulation; provided that no
such offer of the Notes shall require the publication by the Issuer or any Initial Purchaser of a
prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Regulation or supplement a prospectus pursuant to
Article 23 of the Prospectus Regulation. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any
offer within the EEA of the Notes should only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for
the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus, pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus
Regulation or supplement a prospectus pursuant to Article 23 of the Prospectus Regulation, in each
case, in relation to such offer. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do the
Issuer or any Initial Purchaser authorize, the making of any offer of Notes through any financial
intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial Purchasers, which constitute the final placement of
the Notes contemplated in this offering circular.

For the purposes of this provision, the expression an “offer of notes to the public” in relation to any Notes in
any Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the
terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe the
Notes and the expression “Prospectus Regulation” means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 and includes any relevant
implementing measure in any Member State.

Each subscriber for or purchaser of the Notes in the offering located within a Member State will be deemed
to have represented, acknowledged and agreed that it is a “qualified investor” within the meaning of the
Prospectus Regulation. The Issuer, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates, and others will rely upon the trust
and accuracy of the foregoing representation, acknowledgement and agreement. Notwithstanding the above, a
person who is not a qualified investor and who has notified the Initial Purchasers of such fact in writing may,
with the consent of the Initial Purchasers, be permitted to subscribe for or purchase the Notes in the offering.

_Prohibition of Offers to EEA Retail Investors_

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a
person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU
(as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (the “IDD”), where
that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or
(iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document
required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the
Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering
or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under
the PRIIPs Regulation.

_Professional Investors and ECPS Only Target Market_

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of each Initial Purchaser (each, a “manufacturer”),
the target market assessment in respect of the Notes described in this Offering Circular has led to the conclusion
that: (i) the target market for such Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined
in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of such Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients
are appropriate. The target market and distribution channel(s) may vary in relation to sales outside the EEA in
light of local regulatory regimes in force in the relevant jurisdiction. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending such Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market
assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of such Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment)
and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**_United States of America_**

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the “U.S. Securities Act”) or the state securities laws of any state of the United States of America and
may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except in
transactions pursuant to an exemption from, or not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities
Act. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S.

No action has been taken or is being contemplated by the Issuer that would permit a public offering of the
Notes or possession or distribution of this Offering Circular or any amendment thereof, or supplement thereto or
any other offering material relating to the Notes in any jurisdiction where, or in any other circumstances in
which, action for those purposes is required. No offers, sales or deliveries of any Notes, or distribution of this
Offering Circular or any other offering material relating to the Notes, may be made in or from any jurisdiction
except in circumstances that will result in compliance with any applicable laws and regulations and will not
impose any obligations on the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers. Because of the restrictions contained in the front of
this Offering Circular, you are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or
transfer of the Notes.

Each of the Initial Purchasers agrees that it or one or more of its affiliates will sell or arrange for the sale (as
applicable) of Notes only to or with Eligible Non-U.S. Persons. Each of the Initial Purchasers also agrees that it
will send to each other dealer to which it sells Notes pursuant to Regulation S during the Distribution
Compliance Period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes in
non-offshore transactions or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Prior to the expiration of the
Distribution Compliance Period, no offer or resale of Notes will be permitted other than in an offshore
transaction pursuant to Regulation S. Resales of the Notes in a transaction exempt from the registration
requirements under the U.S. Securities Act, as the case may be, are restricted as described under “Transfer
_Restrictions”. Beneficial interests in a Global Note may not be held by a U.S. person at any time, and resales of_
the Notes offered in offshore transactions to Eligible Non-U.S. Persons in reliance on Regulation S may be
effected only in accordance with the transfer restrictions described herein. As used in this paragraph, the terms
“United States” and “U.S.” have the meanings given to them by Regulation S.

**_United Kingdom_**

Each of the Initial Purchasers has represented and agreed that:

(a) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of

204


-----

Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”)) received by it in connection
with the issue or sale of the Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply
to the Issuer; and

(b) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything
done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the U.K..

**Miscellaneous**

This document does not constitute, and may not be used for the purpose of, an offer or solicitation in or
from any jurisdiction where such an offer or solicitation is not authorized.

Attention is drawn to the information set out on the inside front cover of this document in respect of
restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes and on distribution of documents.

You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp taxes
and other charges in connection with the purchases of securities.

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date
specified on the cover page of this Offering Circular, which will be business days (as such term is used for
purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement
cycle is being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary
market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree
otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Circular or the next
business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent
a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors.

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there is currently no market.

The Issuer will apply to list the Notes to be listed on the Official List of Euronext Dublin and to be admitted
for trading on the Global Exchange Market thereof, which is not a regulated market (pursuant to the provisions of
Directive 2004/39/EC) as soon as practicable after the Issue Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may
at its sole option at any time, without the consent of the holders of the Notes or the Trustee, de-list the Notes
from any stock exchange for the purposes of moving the listing of such Notes to the Official List of the
International Stock Exchange. The Initial Purchasers are not under an obligation to make a market in the Notes
and any market making activity, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. In addition, such market
making activities will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a secondary market for the Notes will develop, or if one does
develop, that it will continue. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of or trading market for
the Notes.

No action has been taken or is being contemplated by the Issuer that would permit a public offering of the
Notes or possession or distribution of this Offering Circular or any amendment thereof, or supplement thereto or
any other offering material relating to the Notes in any jurisdiction (other than Ireland) where, or in any other
circumstances in which, action for those purposes is required. No offers, sales or deliveries of any Notes, or
distribution of this Offering Circular or any other offering material relating to the Notes, may be made in or from
any jurisdiction except in circumstances that will result in compliance with any applicable laws and regulations
and will not impose any obligations on the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers. Because of the restrictions contained
in the front of this Offering Circular, you are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale,
pledge or transfer of the Notes.

The Notes are offered when, as and if issued, subject to prior sale or withdrawal, cancellation or
modification of the offer without notice and subject to approval of certain legal matters by counsel and certain
other conditions.

Persons into whose hands this Offering Circular comes are required by the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers
to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in each country or jurisdiction in which they purchase, offer,
sell or deliver Notes or have in their possession, distribute or publish this Offering Circular or any other offering
material relating to the Notes, in all cases at their own expense.

205


-----

In connection with the offering of the Notes, the Stabilizing Manager may engage in overallotment,
stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the
offering size, which creates a syndicate short position. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes
in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate covering
transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order
to cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may cause the price of the
Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If the Stabilizing Manager
engages in stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions, it may discontinue them at any time.

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, including securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment
management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of
the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future
perform, various consulting, financial advisory, investment banking, commercial lending, cash management and
capital markets services for VodafoneZiggo and Liberty Global, for which they received or will receive
customary fees and expenses. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates have arranged and
made loans to subsidiaries of Liberty Global or VodafoneZiggo in the past. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/
or their respective affiliates that have a lending relationship with, and/or own outstanding debt securities of,
VodafoneZiggo and/or its affiliates have hedged, and are likely to hedge in the future, their credit exposure to
VodafoneZiggo and/or its affiliates consistent with their risk management policies. Typically, the Initial
Purchasers and their respective affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist
of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including
potentially the Notes. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading
prices of the Notes. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates provide
VodafoneZiggo and/or its affiliates, from time to time, with hedging services, and may act as counterparties to
certain hedging agreements entered into by VodafoneZiggo and/or its affiliates and such parties will receive
customary fees and commissions for their services in such capacities.

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates
may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative
securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their
customers and such investment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer.
The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish
or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or
recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

Certain Initial Purchasers are lenders under facilities of the Existing Credit Facility, and certain of the Initial
Purchasers and/or affiliates are parties to certain hedging arrangements with VodafoneZiggo and/or its
subsidiaries. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates are party to certain hedging
arrangements and may be counterparties to certain cross-currency swap contracts that we may enter into with
respect to the Notes.

The overall exposure of certain Initial Purchasers to the VodafoneZiggo group could be indirectly reduced
as a result of the Excess Cash Loans under the Excess Cash Facility.

Certain Initial Purchasers are not broker-dealers registered with the SEC and, therefore, may not make sales
of any Notes in the United States or to U.S. persons, except in compliance with applicable U.S. laws and
regulations. To the extent that such Initial Purchasers intend to effect sales of the Notes in the United States, they
will do so only through one or more U.S. registered broker-dealers or otherwise as permitted by applicable U.S.
law.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

Because of the following restrictions, you are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale,
or transfer of the Notes. The Notes have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any state securities
or “Blue Sky” laws or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and, accordingly, may not be reoffered, resold,
pledged or otherwise transferred except in accordance with the restrictions described herein and set forth in the
Trust Deed.

Prospective investors should note that, although the definition of “U.S. person” in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules
is similar to the definition of “U.S. person” in Regulation S, the definitions are not identical and persons who are
not “U.S. persons” under Regulation S may be “U.S. persons” under the U.S. Risk Retention Rules.

(a) Each holder of a Note or a beneficial interest therein acquired on the Issue Date, by its acquisition of a Note
or a beneficial interest in a Note, will be deemed by, and in certain circumstances will be required to
represent to, VodafoneZiggo, the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers that it (1) is not a Risk Retention U.S.
Person (as defined below), (2) is acquiring such Note or a beneficial interest therein for its own account and
not with a view to distribute such Note and (3) is not acquiring such Note or a beneficial interest therein as
part of a scheme to evade the requirements of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules (including acquiring such Note
through a non-Risk Retention U.S. Person, rather than a Risk Retention U.S. Person, as part of a scheme to
evade the 10 percent Risk Retention U.S. Person limitation in the exemption provided for in Section 20 of
the U.S. Risk Retention Rules described herein). Prospective investors should note that the definition of
U.S. person in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules is substantially similar to, but not identical to, the definition of
U.S. person under Regulation S, and that persons who are not “U.S. persons” under Regulation S may be
U.S. persons under the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. VodafoneZiggo and the Issuer will presume that any
person that is a U.S. Person under Regulation S will also be a U.S. person under the U.S. Risk Retention
Rules. The definition of U.S. person in the U.S. Risk Retention Rules is excerpted below. Particular
attention should be paid to clauses (ii) and (viii)(y), which are different than comparable provisions from
Regulation S.

Under the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, and subject to limited exceptions, “U.S. person” (and “Risk Retention
U.S. Person” as used in this Offering Circular) means any of the following:

(i) any natural person resident in the United States;

(ii) any partnership, corporation, limited liability company, or other organisation or entity organised or
incorporated under the laws of any State or of the United States (the comparable provision from
Regulation S is “any partnership or corporation organised or incorporated under the laws of the United
States.”);

(iii) any estate of which any executor or administrator is a U.S. person (as defined under any other clause of
this definition);

(iv) any trust of which any trustee is a U.S. person (as defined under any other clause of this definition);

(v) any agency or branch of a foreign entity located in the United States;

(vi) any non-discretionary account or similar account (other than an estate or trust) held by a dealer or other
fiduciary for the benefit or account of a U.S. person (as defined under any other clause of this
definition);

(vii) any discretionary account or similar account (other than an estate or trust) held by a dealer or other
fiduciary organised, incorporated, or (if an individual) resident in the United States; and

(viii) any partnership, corporation, limited liability company, or other organisation or entity if:

(x) organised or incorporated under the laws of any foreign jurisdiction; and

(y) formed by a U.S. person (as defined under any other clause of this definition) principally for the
purpose of investing in securities not registered under the Securities Act (the comparable
provision from Regulation S is “formed by a U.S. person principally for the purpose of investing
in securities not registered under the Securities Act, unless it is organised or incorporated, and
owned, by accredited investors (as defined in 17 CFR 230.501(a)) who are not natural persons,
estates or trusts.”).

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, by holding a Note, you will acknowledge and agree, among other things,
that you understand that the Issuer is not registered as an investment company under the Investment

207


-----

Company Act and that, in connection with any subsequent resale or transfer of the Notes that are made in
reliance on Rule 144A after the Distribution Compliance Period, the Issuer will not be registered as an
investment company under the Investment Company Act, in reliance upon the exception contained in
Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act for companies (a) whose outstanding securities offered
within the U.S. are beneficially owned by U.S. residents that are “qualified purchasers” or “knowledgeable
employees” with respect to the Issuer at the time of acquisition of such securities and certain transferees
thereof identified in Rules 3c-5 or 3c-6 under the Investment Company Act and (b) which do not make, or
propose to make, a public offering of their securities in the United States. Section 2(a)(51) of the Investment
Company Act defines the term “qualified purchaser” and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the
“SEC”) has designated several additional classes of qualified purchasers, including companies beneficially
owned exclusively by one or more “qualified purchasers”. Each of the following would fall within the
definition of “qualified purchaser”:

(i) a natural person who owns not less than $5,000,000 in “investments,” as such term has been defined in
(and as the value of such investments are calculated pursuant to) the relevant rules promulgated by the
SEC as of the date hereof;

(ii) a company that owns not less than $5,000,000 in “investments” and that is owned directly or indirectly
by or for two or more natural persons who are related as siblings or spouse (including former spouses),
or direct lineal descendants by birth or adoption, spouses of such persons, the estates of such persons,
or foundations, charitable organizations, or trusts established by or for the benefit of such persons;

(iii) a trust that is not covered by clause (ii) and that was not formed for the specific purpose of acquiring
the securities offered, as to which the trustee or other person authorized to make decisions with respect
to the trust, and each settlor or other person who contributed assets to the trust, is a person described in
clause (i), (ii) or (iv); or

(iv) a person, acting for its own account or the accounts of other qualified purchasers, who in the aggregate
owns and invests on a discretionary basis, not less than $25,000,000 in “investments”;

_provided that, in the case of an entity that would be an investment company but for the exclusions from the_
Investment Company Act provided by Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) thereof (“excepted investment
company”), (i) all of the beneficial owners of its outstanding securities (other than short-term paper) that
acquired such securities on or before 30 April 1996 (“pre-amendment beneficial owners”) and (ii) all of the
pre-amendment beneficial owners of the outstanding securities (other than short-term paper) of an excepted
investment company that directly or indirectly own any of its outstanding securities, must have consented to
its treatment as a “qualified purchaser”.

**Regulation S Global Notes**

If you are either an Initial Purchaser or a transferee of Notes represented by an interest in a Regulation S
Global Note you will be deemed to have represented and agreed as follows (except as may be expressly agreed in
writing between you and the Issuer, if you are an Initial Purchaser):

(a) In connection with the purchase of such Notes: (A) none of (i) the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers,
VodafoneZiggo, VodafoneZiggo Group Holding B.V., Liberty Global Europe Holding II B.V., Liberty
Global, Vodafone, Vodafone International or any person who controls them or any director, officer,
employee or agent of any of theirs or affiliate of any such person, or (ii) the Notes Trustee, the Security
Trustee, the Transfer Agent, any other Agent or any other party to the transaction contemplated by this
Offering Circular or any of their respective affiliates, is acting as a fiduciary or financial or investment
adviser for such beneficial owner; (B) such beneficial owner is not relying (for purposes of making any
investment decision or otherwise) upon any advice, counsel or representations (whether written or oral)
of (i) the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, VodafoneZiggo, VodafoneZiggo Group Holding B.V., Liberty
Global Europe Holding II B.V., Liberty Global, Vodafone, Vodafone International or any person who
controls them or any director, officer, employee or agent of any of theirs or affiliate of any such person,
or (ii) the Notes Trustee, the Security Trustee, the Transfer Agent, any other Agent or any other party
to the transaction contemplated by this Offering Circular or any of their respective affiliates, other than
any statements in this Offering Circular, and such beneficial owner has read and understands this
Offering Circular; (C) such beneficial owner has consulted with its own legal, regulatory, tax, business,
investment, financial and accounting advisers to the extent it has deemed necessary and has made its
own investment decisions (including decisions regarding the suitability of any transaction pursuant to
the Trust Deed) based upon its own judgment and upon any advice from such advisers as it has deemed
necessary and not upon any view expressed by (i) the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, VodafoneZiggo,

208


-----

VodafoneZiggo Group Holding B.V., Liberty Global Europe Holding II B.V., Liberty Global,
Vodafone, Vodafone International or any person who controls them or any director, officer, employee
or agent of any of theirs or affiliate of any such person, or (ii) the Notes Trustee, the Security Trustee,
the Transfer Agent, any other Agent or any other party to the transaction contemplated by this Offering
Circular or any of their respective affiliates; (D) such beneficial owner is not a “U.S. person” (as
defined in Regulation S and the U.S. Risk Retention Rules) and is acquiring the Notes in an offshore
transaction (as defined in Regulation S) in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by
Regulation S; (E) such beneficial owner is acquiring its interest in such Notes for its own account;
(F) such beneficial owner was not formed for the purpose of investing in such Notes; (G) such
beneficial owner understands that the Issuer may receive a list of participants holding interests in the
Notes from one or more book-entry depositories; (H) such beneficial owner will hold and transfer at
least the minimum denomination of such Notes; (I) such beneficial owner will provide notice of the
relevant transfer restrictions to subsequent transferees; and (J) such beneficial owner is not acquiring
any Note as part of a plan to reduce, avoid or evade U.S. federal income tax.

(b) Each acquirer and each transferee of a Note or any interest therein will be deemed to have represented,
warranted and agreed at the time of its acquisition and throughout the period that it holds such Note or
any interest therein that it is not, and is not acting on behalf of (and for so long as such acquirer or
transferee holds such Notes or any interest therein will not be, and will not be acting on behalf of) a
Benefit Plan Investor or an employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) which is
subject to any Similar Laws, and no part of the assets to be used by such acquirer or transferee to
acquire or hold such Notes or any interest therein constitutes the assets of any Benefit Plan Investor or
any such employee benefit plan.

(c) Such beneficial owner understands that such Notes are being offered only in a transaction not involving
any public offering in the United States within the meaning of the U.S. Securities Act, such Notes have
not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act, and, if in the future such beneficial
owner decides to offer, resell, pledge or otherwise transfer such Notes, such Notes may be offered,
resold, pledged or otherwise transferred only in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Deed and
the legend on such Notes. Such beneficial owner acknowledges that no representation has been made
as to the availability of any exemption under the U.S. Securities Act or any state securities laws for
resale of such Notes. Such beneficial owner understands that the Issuer has not been registered under
the Investment Company Act, and, in connection with any subsequent resale or transfer of the Notes
that are made in reliance on Rule 144A after the Distribution Compliance period, that the Issuer intends
to comply with the exception under Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act in order to avoid
the adverse consequences of failing to register as an “investment company”. Such beneficial owner
understands that any transferee will be a Qualified Institutional Buyer that is also a Qualified
Purchaser.

(d) Such beneficial owner is aware that, except as otherwise provided in the Trust Deed, any Notes being
sold to it in reliance on Regulation S will be represented by one or more Regulation S Global Notes and
that in each case beneficial interests therein may be held only through a common depository for the
respective accounts of Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

(e) Such beneficial owner will provide notice to each person to whom it proposes to transfer any interest in
the Notes of the transfer restrictions and representations set forth in the Trust Deed.

**Non-Permitted Holder**

If any U.S. person that is not both a Qualified Institutional Buyer and a Qualified Purchaser becomes the
holder or beneficial owner of an interest in any Note (any such person a “Non-Permitted Holder”), the Issuer
shall, promptly after discovery that such person is a Non-Permitted Holder, send notice to such Non-Permitted
Holder demanding that such Non-Permitted Holder transfer its interest to a person that is not a Non-Permitted
Holder within 30 days after the date of such notice. If such Non-Permitted Holder fails to so transfer its Notes,
the Issuer shall have the right, without further notice to the Non-Permitted Holder, to sell such Notes or interest
in such Notes to a purchaser selected by the Issuer that is not a Non-Permitted Holder on such terms as the Issuer
may choose. The Issuer may select the purchaser by soliciting one or more bids from one or more brokers or
other market professionals that regularly deal in securities similar to the Notes and selling such Notes to the
highest such bidder. However, the Issuer may select a purchaser by any other means determined by it in its sole
discretion. Each Noteholder, as applicable, the Non-Permitted Holder and each other person in the chain of title
from the holder to the Non-Permitted Holder, by its acceptance of an interest in the Notes agrees to cooperate
with the Issuer and the Transfer Agent to effect such transfers. The proceeds of such sale, net of any

209


-----

commissions, expenses and taxes due in connection with such sale shall be remitted to the Non-Permitted Holder.
The terms and conditions of any sale shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Issuer, and the Issuer shall
not be liable to any person having an interest in the Notes sold as a result of any such sale or the exercise of such
discretion.

**Legends**

The Notes will bear a legend substantially to the following effect unless the Issuer determines otherwise in
compliance with applicable law:

**The Notes Trustee**

The Notes provide for the Notes Trustee to take action on behalf of the Noteholders in certain
circumstances, but only if the Notes Trustee is indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be
possible for the Notes Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and accordingly in such
circumstances, the Notes Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity or
security to it, and it will be for the Noteholders to take action directly. If the Notes Trustee resigns or is removed,
the Issuer will appoint a successor.

**Consents and Authorizations**

The Issuer has obtained all necessary consents, approvals and authorizations in connection with the issue
and performance of the Notes and the Transaction Documents. The issue of the Notes, the creation of the security

215


-----

The Trust Deed requires the Issuer to provide certification to the Notes Trustee on an annual basis and upon
request that no Issuer Event of Default, Potential Event of Default (as defined in Condition 1 (“Definitions and
_Principles of Construction—General Interpretation”)) or other breach of its obligations under the Trust Deed has_

**Documents Available**

Copies of the following documents may be inspected in electronic format at the registered offices of the
Issuer during usual business hours on any weekday (Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays excepted) for the
term of the Notes:

(a) the Articles of Association;

(b) the Trust Deed;

(c) the Agency and Account Bank Agreement;

(d) the Framework Assignment Agreement;

(e) the Accounts Payable Management Services Agreement;

(f) the standard form of Discounted Payments Purchase Agreement;

(g) the Issuer Management Agreement;

(h) the New VFZ Facilities Agreement;

(i) the Expenses Agreement; and

(j) the Issue Date Arrangements Agreement.

**Change of Control**

Dutch company law combined with the holding structure of the Issuer, covenants made by the Issuer in the
Transaction Documents and the role of the Security Trustee are together intended to prevent any abuse of control
of the Issuer. As far as the Issuer is aware, there are currently no arrangements in place which may at a
subsequent date result in a change of control of the issuer.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

The Issuer is a private limited liability company (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid)
incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands. None of the Directors and officers of the Issuer are residents of
the United States, and all or a substantial portion of the assets of the Issuer and such persons may be located
outside of the United States at any time. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of
process within the United States upon the Issuer or such persons or to enforce against any of them in the United
States courts judgments obtained in United States courts (or any non-Dutch courts), including judgments
predicated upon civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any State or territory within
the United States.

The Netherlands does not currently have a treaty with the United States providing for reciprocal recognition
and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final
judgment for the payment of money rendered by any court in any federal or state court in the United States based
on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be
recognized or enforceable in the Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in the
Netherlands, the claim must be relitigated before a competent Dutch court. A final judgment by a U.S. court,
however, may under current practice be given binding effect, if and to the extent that the Dutch court finds that
(i) the jurisdiction of the U.S. court has been based on grounds that are internationally acceptable, (ii) the
judgment by the U.S. court was rendered in legal proceedings that comply with the standards of the proper
administration of justice that includes sufficient safeguards (behoorlijke rechtspleging), (iii) the judgment by the
U.S. court is not incompatible with a decision rendered between the same parties by a Dutch court, or with a
previous decision rendered between the same parties by a foreign court in a dispute that concerns the same
subject and is based on the same cause, provided that the previous decision qualifies for acknowledgement in the
Netherlands and (iv) the final judgment does not contravene public policy (openbare orde) of the Netherlands.

216


-----

Subject to the foregoing and provided that service of process occurs in accordance with applicable treaties,
investors may be able to enforce in the Netherlands, judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from
U.S. federal or state courts. Moreover, a Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court
and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages.

Dutch civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. Insofar as the
production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law
provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may prior to trial compel the
production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this
manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process exists under
Dutch law.

Enforcement and recognition of judgments of U.S. courts in the Netherlands are governed by the provisions
of the Dutch Civil Procedure Code (Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering).

**Foreign Language**

The language of the Offering Circular is English. Certain legislative references and technical terms have been
cited in their original language in order that the correct meaning may be ascribed to them under applicable law.

**Legal Matters**

Certain legal matters in connection with this offering will be passed upon for VodafoneZiggo and the Issuer
by Ropes & Gray International LLP, London, England, as to matters of United States federal, New York law and
English law, and by Allen & Overy LLP, Amsterdam, as to matters of Dutch law.

Certain legal matters in connection with this offering will be passed upon for the Initial Purchasers by
Latham & Watkins (London) LLP, London, England, as to matters of United States federal, New York law and
English law, and by Clifford Chance LLP, as to matters of Dutch law.

(Initial Utilisations on the Issue Date).

Following a Change of Control Acceptance, the Borrower shall pay to the Lender on the Change of Control
Prepayment Date a fee in an amount equal to 1.0 per cent. of the amount equal to the difference between

**12.1 Definitions**

In this Agreement:

**Protected Party means a Lender which is or will be, for or on account of Tax, subject to any liability or**

purposes of Tax to be received or receivable) under a Finance Document.

**Tax Credit means a credit against, relief or remission for, or repayment of any Tax.**

**Tax Deduction means a deduction or withholding for or on account of Tax from a payment under a Finance**
Document, other than:

(a) a FATCA Deduction; or

(b) a deduction or withholding for or on account of any Bank Levy (or otherwise attributable to, or arising
as a consequence of, a Bank Levy).

**Treaty Lender means the Lender if it is (on the date a payment falls due), entitled to that payment under a**
double taxation agreement in force on the date (subject to the completion of any necessary procedural
formalities) without a Tax Deduction.

**Tax Payment means an increased payment made by an Obligor to a Finance Party under Clause 12.2 (Tax**
_gross-up) or a payment under Clause 12.4 (Tax Indemnity)._

In this Clause 12, a reference to determines or determined means a determination made in the absolute
discretion of the person making the determination acting reasonably and in good faith.

**12.2 Tax gross-up**

(a) Each Obligor shall make all payments to be made by it without any Tax Deduction, unless a Tax
Deduction is required by law.

(b) The Borrower shall promptly upon becoming aware that an Obligor must make a Tax Deduction (or
that there is any change in the rate or the basis of a Tax Deduction) notify the Administrator (on behalf
of the Lender) accordingly.

A-23


-----

(c) If a Tax Deduction is required by law to be made by an Obligor, the amount of the payment due from
that Obligor shall be increased to an amount which (after making any Tax Deduction) leaves an amount
equal to the payment which would have been due if no Tax Deduction had been required.

(d) If an Obligor is required to make a Tax Deduction, that Obligor shall make that Tax Deduction and any
payment required in connection with that Tax Deduction within the time allowed and in the minimum
amount required by law.

(e) Within 30 days of making either a Tax Deduction or any payment required in connection with that Tax
Deduction, the Obligor making that Tax Deduction shall deliver to the Administrator (on behalf of the
relevant Finance Party) evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Administrator (on behalf of the relevant
Finance Party) that the Tax Deduction has been made or (as applicable) any appropriate payment paid
to the relevant taxing authority.

(f) A Treaty Lender and each Obligor which makes a payment to which that Treaty Lender is entitled shall
co-operate and use its reasonable efforts to complete any procedural formalities and provide any
information, in each case on a timely basis, necessary for that Obligor to obtain authorisation to make
that payment without a Tax Deduction (or with a reduced rate of such Tax Deduction).

(g) Each party may make any FATCA Deduction it is required to make by FATCA, and any payment
required in connection with that FATCA Deduction. If a FATCA Deduction is required by law to be
made by an Obligor, the amount of the payment due from that Obligor shall be increased to an amount
which (after making any FATCA Deduction) leaves an amount equal to the payment which would have
been due if no FATCA Deduction had been required.

(h) If an Obligor is required to make a FATCA Deduction, that Obligor shall make that FATCA Deduction
and any payment required in connection with that FATCA Deduction within the time allowed and in
the minimum amount required by law.

(i) Within 30 days of making either a FATCA Deduction or any payment required in connection with that
FATCA Deduction, the Obligor making that FATCA Deduction shall deliver to the Administrator (on
behalf of the Lender) evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Administrator (on behalf of the Lender)
that the FATCA Deduction has been made or (as applicable) any appropriate payment paid to the
relevant taxing authority.

**12.3 Lender Tax Status**

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Clause 12 (Tax Gross-up and Indemnities):

(i) if the Lender is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to
payments made by the Borrower under any Finance Document, the Lender shall deliver to the
Borrower and the Administrator, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the
Administrator (and promptly after the occurrence of a change in the Lender’s circumstance
requiring a change in the most recent documentation previously delivered), such properly
completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the
Administrator as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate
of withholding; and

(ii) if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrator, the Lender shall deliver such other
documentation prescribed by an applicable requirement of law or reasonably requested by the
Borrower or the Administrator as will enable the Borrower or the Administrator to determine
whether or not the Lender is subject to withholding or information reporting requirements. In the
event that the Lender fails to comply with the foregoing requirement, the Borrower shall be
permitted to withhold and retain an amount in respect of the applicable withholding tax estimated
in good faith by the Borrower to be required to be withheld in respect of interest payable to the
Lender. The Borrower is not required to make a Tax Payment to the Lender under this Agreement
to the extent such Taxes are attributable to a failure by the Lender to provide the documentation
required to be delivered pursuant to the first sentence of this Clause 12.3(a).

(b) The Lender shall confirm whether it is a FATCA Exempt Party and shall provide any documentation,
forms and other information relating to its status under FATCA reasonably requested by the
Administrator or the Borrower sufficient for the Administrator or the Borrower to comply with their
obligations under FATCA and to determine whether the Lender has complied with such applicable
reporting requirements.

**12.4 Tax indemnity**

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, the Borrower shall (within ten Business Days of demand by the
Administrator (on behalf of the Lender or itself)) pay to a Protected Party an amount equal to the loss,
liability or cost which that Protected Party reasonably determines will be or has been (directly or
indirectly) suffered for or on account of Tax by that Protected Party. The Protected Party shall within
five Business Days’ of request by the Borrower provide to the Borrower reasonable written details
explaining the loss, liability or cost and the calculation of the amount claimed by the Protected Party.

(b) Paragraph (a) above shall not apply with respect to any Tax assessed on the Lender:

(i) under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Lender is incorporated or, if different, the
jurisdiction (or jurisdictions) in which the Lender is treated as resident for tax purposes; or

(ii) under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Lender’s Facility Office is located in respect of
amounts received or receivable in that jurisdiction,

if that Tax is imposed on or calculated by reference to the net income or net profits received or
receivable (but not any sum deemed to be received or receivable) by the Lender.

(c) A Protected Party making, or intending to make a claim pursuant to paragraph (a) above shall promptly
notify the Administrator (on behalf of the Lender) of the event which will give, or has given, rise to the
claim, including details of the nature of the Tax due or paid by that Protected Party, following which
the Administrator (on behalf of the Lender) shall promptly provide such information to the Borrower.

(d) A Protected Party shall, on receiving a payment from an Obligor under this Clause 12.4, notify the
Administrator (on behalf of the Lender).

**12.5 Tax Credit**

(a) If the Borrower makes a Tax Payment and the relevant Finance Party determines that:

(i) a Tax Credit is attributable to that Tax Payment; and

(ii) that Finance Party has obtained, utilised and retained that Tax Credit,

the Finance Party shall pay an amount to the Borrower which that Finance Party determines will leave
it (after that payment) in the same after-Tax position as it would have been in had the Tax Payment not
been made by the Borrower.

(b) No provision of this Agreement shall:

(i) interfere with the right of any Finance Party to arrange its tax or any other affairs in whatever
manner it thinks fit or oblige any Finance Party to claim any credit, relief, remission or repayment
in respect of any payment of Tax in priority to any other credit, relief, remission or repayment
available to it, except that the Finance Party’s sole reason (acting in good faith) for not claiming or
for deferring such credit, relief, remission or repayment shall not be its obligation to make a
payment under this Clause 12.5; or

(ii) oblige any Finance Party to disclose any information relating to its Tax or other affairs or any
computations in respect thereof.

**12.6 Value added tax**

(a) All consideration expressed to be payable under a Finance Document by any Party to a Finance Party
shall be deemed to be exclusive of any VAT and no Party shall exercise any potential option for
waiving a VAT exemption. Subject to paragraph (b), if VAT is chargeable on any supply made by a
Finance Party to any Party in connection with a Finance Document, that Party shall pay to the Finance
Party (in addition to and at the same time as paying the consideration) an amount equal to the amount
of the VAT, unless the VAT charge is caused by the Finance Party’s option to waive a VAT
exemption, and in either case concurrently against the issue of an appropriate invoice.

(b) If VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Finance Party (the “VAT Supplier”) to
any other Finance Party (the “Recipient”) in connection with a Finance Document, and any Party other
than the Recipient (the “Subject Party”) is required by the terms of any Finance Document to pay an
amount equal to the consideration for such supply to the VAT Supplier (rather than being required to
reimburse or indemnify the Recipient in respect of that consideration), (i) if the VAT Supplier is

A-25


-----

required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT, the Subject Party must also pay to the
VAT Supplier and, (ii) if the Recipient is required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT
the Subject Party must pay to the Recipient, (in addition to and at the same time as paying such
amount) an amount equal to the amount of such VAT. Where paragraph (i) applies, the Recipient must
promptly pay to the Subject Party an amount equal to any credit or repayment obtained by the
Recipient from the relevant tax authority which the Recipient reasonably determines is in respect of the
VAT chargeable on that supply. Where paragraph (ii) applies, the Subject Party must only pay to the
Recipient an amount equal to the amount of such VAT to the extent that the Recipient reasonably
determines that it is not entitled to a credit or repayment from the relevant tax authority in respect of
that VAT.

(c) Where a Finance Document requires any Party to reimburse a Finance Party for any costs or expenses,
that Party shall also at the same time pay and indemnify the Finance Party for the full amount of such
costs and expenses including such costs that represent VAT incurred by the Finance Party in respect of
the costs or expenses to the extent that the Finance Party reasonably determines that it is not entitled to
credit or repayment from the relevant tax authority in respect of the VAT.

(d) Any reference in this Clause 12.6 to any Party shall, at any time when such Party is treated as a
member of a group including but not limited to any fiscal unities for VAT purposes, include (where
appropriate and unless the context otherwise requires) a reference to the representative member of such
group at such time (the term “representative member” to have the same meaning as in the relevant
legislation of any jurisdiction having implemented Council Directive 2006/112/EC on the common
system of value added tax).

(e) If VAT is chargeable on any supply made by a Finance Party to any Party under a Finance Document
and if reasonably requested by such Finance Party, that Party must give the Finance Party details of its
VAT registration number and any other information as is reasonably requested in connection with the
Finance Party’s reporting requirements for the supply and at such time that the Finance Party may
reasonably request it.

(f) Where the Borrower is required to make a payment under paragraph (b) above, such amount shall not
become due until the Borrower has received a formal invoice detailing the amount to be paid.

**13.** **MITIGATION BY THE LENDER**

**13.1 Mitigation**

(a) The Lender shall, in consultation with the Borrower, take all reasonable steps to mitigate any
circumstances which arise and which would result in any amount becoming payable under or pursuant
to, or cancelled pursuant to, any of Clause 7.1 (Illegality) or Clause 12 (Tax Gross up and Indemnities).

(b) Paragraph (a) above does not in any way limit the obligations of any Obligor under the Finance
Documents.

**13.2 Limitation of liability**

(a) The Borrower shall indemnify the Lender for all costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the Lender
as a result of steps taken by it under Clause 13.1 (Mitigation).

(b) The Lender is not obliged to take any steps under Clause 13.1 (Mitigation) if, in the opinion of the
Lender (acting reasonably), to do so might be prejudicial to it.

**14.** **GUARANTEE AND INDEMNITY**

**14.1 Guarantee and Indemnity**

With effect from the Signing Date or if later, the date on which it accedes to this Agreement in such
capacity, each Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally jointly and severally:

(a) guarantees to the Lender punctual performance by each Obligor of its payment obligations under the
Finance Documents;

(b) undertakes with the Lender that whenever an Obligor does not pay any amount when due under or in
connection with any Finance Document, that Guarantor shall promptly on demand of the Administrator
(on behalf of the Lender) pay that amount as if it were the principal obligor provided that before any
such demand if made on a Guarantor, demand for payment of the relevant amount shall first have been
made on the Borrower; and

A-26


-----

(c) indemnifies the Lender immediately on demand against any cost, loss or liability suffered by the
Lender if any obligation of an Obligor guaranteed by it is or becomes unenforceable, invalid or illegal.
The amount of the cost, loss or liability shall be equal to the amount which the Lender would otherwise
have been entitled to recover.

Any demand issued to a Guarantor under this Clause 14.1 shall be copied to the Borrower at the same time
as it is issued to the relevant Guarantor, provided that failure to do so shall not affect the validity or
effectiveness of the demand or the obligations of the Guarantor under this Clause 14 (Guarantee and
_Indemnity)._

**14.2 Continuing Guarantee**

Each guarantee pursuant to this Clause 14 (Guarantee and Indemnity) is a continuing guarantee and will
extend to the ultimate balance of sums payable by any Obligor under the Finance Documents, regardless of
any intermediate payment or discharge in whole or in part.

**14.3 Reinstatement**

If any payment by an Obligor or any discharge given by the Lender (whether in respect of the obligations of
any Obligor or any security for those obligations or otherwise) is avoided or reduced as a result of
insolvency or any similar event:

(a) the liability of each Obligor shall continue as if the payment, discharge, avoidance or reduction had not
occurred; and

(b) the Lender shall be entitled to recover the value or amount of that security or payment from each
Obligor, as if the payment, discharge, avoidance or reduction had not occurred.

**14.4 Waiver of defences**

The obligations of each Guarantor under this Clause 14 will not be affected by an act, omission, matter or
thing which, but for this Clause 14 would reduce, release or prejudice any of its obligations under this
Clause 14 (without limitation and whether or not known to it or the Lender) including:

(a) any time, waiver or consent granted to, or composition with, any Obligor or other person;

(b) the release of any other Obligor or any other person under the terms of any composition or arrangement
with any creditor of any member of the Group;

(c) the taking, variation, compromise, exchange, renewal or release of, or refusal or neglect to perfect, take
up or enforce, any rights against, or security over assets of, any Obligor or other person or any
non-presentation or non-observance of any formality or other requirement in respect of any instrument
or any failure to realise the full value of any security;

(d) any incapacity or lack of power, authority or legal personality of or dissolution or change in the
members or status of an Obligor or any other person;

(e) any amendment, novation, supplement, extension, restatement (however fundamental and whether or
not more onerous) or replacement of any Finance Document or any other document or security
including without limitation any change in the purpose of, any extension of or any increase in any
facility or the addition of any new facility under any Finance Document or other document or security;

(f) any unenforceability, illegality or invalidity of any obligation of any person under any Finance
Document or any other document or security; or

(g) any insolvency or similar proceedings.

**14.5 Immediate recourse**

Each Guarantor waives any right it may have of first requiring the Lender (or any trustee or agent on its
behalf) to proceed against or enforce any other rights or security or claim payment from any person before
claiming from that Guarantor under this Clause 14 provided that no demand for any payment may be made
on a Guarantor unless such demand has first been made on the Borrower. This waiver applies irrespective of
any law or any provision of a Finance Document to the contrary.

A-27

**14.6 Appropriations**

Until all amounts then due and payable by the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance Documents
have been irrevocably paid in full, the Lender (or the Administrator or any trustee or agent on its behalf)
may:

(a) refrain from applying or enforcing any other moneys, security or rights held or received by the Lender
(or any trustee or agent on its behalf) in respect of those amounts, or apply and enforce the same in
such manner and order as it sees fit (whether against those amounts or otherwise) and no Guarantor
shall be entitled to the benefit of the same; and

(b) hold in an interest-bearing suspense account any moneys received from any Guarantor or on account of
any Guarantor’s liability under this Clause 14 provided that the Lender (or the Administrator or any
trustee or agent on its behalf) shall promptly upon receiving moneys sufficient to discharge all amounts
then due and payable by the Obligors under the Finance Documents, apply such moneys to so
discharge such amounts.

**14.7 Deferral of Guarantors’ rights**

Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Borrower under or in connection with the
Finance Documents have been irrevocably paid in full and unless the Administrator (on behalf of the
Lender) otherwise directs, no Guarantor will exercise any rights which it may have by reason of
performance by it of its obligations under the Finance Documents or by reason of any amount being
payable, or liability arising, under this Clause 14:

(a) to claim by way of contribution or indemnity in relation to any of the obligations of the Borrower under
any of the Finance Documents;

(b) to claim or prove as a creditor of the Borrower or any other person or its estate in competition with the
Lender of any of them;

the Lender under the Finance Documents or of any other guarantee or security taken pursuant to, or in
connection with, the Finance Documents by the Lender;

(d) to bring legal or other proceedings for an order requiring any Obligor to make any payment, or perform
any obligation, in respect of which any Guarantor has given a guarantee, undertaking or indemnity
under this Clause 14); and/or

(e) to exercise any right of set-off against any Obligor.

If a Guarantor receives any benefit, payment or distribution in relation to such rights it shall hold that
benefit, payment or distribution to the extent necessary to enable all amounts which may be or become
payable to the Lender by the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance Documents to be repaid in
full on trust for the Lender and shall promptly pay or transfer the same to the Administrator (on behalf of the
Lender) or as the Administrator (on behalf of the Lender) may direct for application in accordance with
Clause 19 (Payment Mechanics).

**14.8 Release of Guarantors’ right of contribution**

If any Guarantor (a Retiring Guarantor) ceases to be a Guarantor in accordance with the terms of the
Finance Documents for the purpose of any sale or other disposal of that Retiring Guarantor or resigns in
accordance with Clause 18.5 (Resignation of a Guarantor) then on the date such Retiring Guarantor ceases
to be a Guarantor:

(a) that Retiring Guarantor is released by each other Guarantor from any liability (whether past, present or
future and whether actual or contingent) to make a contribution to any other Guarantor arising by
reason of the performance by any other Guarantor of its obligations under the Finance Documents; and

(b) each other Guarantor waives any rights it may have by reason of the performance of its obligations
under the Finance Documents to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of
subrogation or otherwise) of any rights of the Lender under any Finance Document or of any other
security taken pursuant to, or in connection with, any Finance Document where such rights or security
are granted by or in relation to the assets of the Retiring Guarantor.

_provided that such guarantee will be released as a whole or in part to the extent it is necessary to_
achieve compliance with such prohibition or restriction;

(ii) other than in the case of a Guarantor which is a Receivables Obligor unless such Guarantor will

and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will, at the Company’s option, either (a) be determined on
the date of such revolving credit facility or such entry into or increase in commitments (assuming
that the full amount thereof has been borrowed as of such date) or other Indebtedness, and, if such
Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio test or other provision of this Section 4.09 is satisfied with
respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or re-borrowing thereunder (and the issuance and
creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this
covenant irrespective of the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio test or other provision of this this
Section 4.09 at the time of any borrowing or re-borrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of
credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount permitted to be borrowed or
re-borrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date
pursuant to the operation of this sub-clause (a) shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as
of such date for purposes of the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio and, to the extent of the usage of
clauses (1) through (21) under Section 4.09(b) (if any), shall be deemed to be Incurred and
outstanding under such clauses) or (b) be determined on the date such amount is borrowed
pursuant to any such facility or increased commitment, and in the case of subclause (a) of this
Section 4.09(d)(7), the Company may revoke any such determination at any time and from time to
time; and

(8) with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a Credit Facility, re-borrowings of amounts
previously repaid pursuant to “cash sweep” or “clean down” provisions or any similar provisions
under a Credit Facility that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to be repaid periodically shall
only be deemed for the purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such
Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent re-borrowing thereof.

(e) Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness,
Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock and increases in the amount of Indebtedness due to a change in
accounting principles will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this
Section 4.09. The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (i) the accreted value
thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (ii) the principal amount or
liquidation preference thereof, together with any interest thereon that is more than 30 days past due, in the
case of any other Indebtedness.

(f) If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date.

(g) For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall
be (1) calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was
Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower
Euro Equivalent), in the case of revolving credit Indebtedness; provided that if such Indebtedness is
Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would
cause the applicable euro-dominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency
exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-dominated restriction shall be deemed not
to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the
principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced; and (2) if and for so long as any such Indebtedness

A-58


-----

is subject to an agreement intended to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to
the currency in which such Indebtedness is denominated covering principal and interest on such
Indebtedness, the swapped rate of such Indebtedness as of the date of the applicable swap. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Section 4.09, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company,
VZ Financing II, an Affiliate Covenant Party and the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur pursuant to this
Section 4.09 shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of
currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred
in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency
exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in
effect on the date of such refinancing.

(h) The Company, VZ Financing II and any Affiliate Covenant Party will not Incur, and will not permit any
Guarantor to Incur, any Indebtedness that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other
Indebtedness of the Company, VZ Financing II, any Affiliate Covenant Party or any Guarantor unless such
Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Facilities and, if applicable, the
guarantee of the Facilities by the person Incurring such Indebtedness, on substantially identical terms (as
conclusively determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or senior management of the Company,
VZ Financing II or the Affiliate Covenant Party); provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed
to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Company,
VZ Financing II, any Affiliate Covenant Party, any Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary solely by
virtue of being unsecured or secured on a junior Lien basis or by virtue of not being guaranteed or by virtue
of the application of waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of
Indebtedness.

(i) For purposes of determining compliance with (1) Section 4.09(a) and (2) any other provision of the Finance
Documents which requires the calculation of any financial ratio or test, including the Consolidated Net
Leverage Ratio, the Euro Equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency (if
such Indebtedness has not been swapped into euros, or if such Indebtedness has been swapped into a
currency other than euros) shall be calculated by the Company using the same weighted average exchange
rates for the relevant period used in the consolidated financial statements of the Reporting Entity for
calculating the Euro Equivalent of Consolidated EBITDA denominated in the same currency as the currency
in which such Indebtedness is denominated or into which it has been swapped.

**_Section 4.10 Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

(a) The Company, VZ Financing II and an Affiliate Covenant Party will not, and will not permit any of the
Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition unless:

responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such
fair market value to be determined on the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as
conclusively +determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or senior management of the
Company, VZ Financing II or an Affiliate Covenant Party (including as to the value of all non-cash
consideration), of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition;

(2) unless the Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration from such
Asset Disposition (excluding any consideration by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming
responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, other than Indebtedness) received by the
Company, VZ Financing II, an Affiliate Covenant Party or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may
be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents; and

(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied by the
Company, VZ Financing II, an Affiliate Covenant Party or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may
be:

(A) to the extent the Company, VZ Financing II, an Affiliate Covenant Party or any Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is required by the terms of any Indebtedness), to prepay,
repay or purchase Senior Indebtedness of the Company (including the Facilities), VZ Financing II,
an Affiliate Covenant Party or any Guarantor, or Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is
not an Obligor (in each case other than Indebtedness owed to the Company, VZ Financing II, an
Affiliate Covenant Party or an Affiliate of the Company) within 365 days from the later of the
date of such Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that,

in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause
(A), the Company, VZ Financing II, an Affiliate Covenant Party or such Restricted Subsidiary

any revolving Indebtedness) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal
amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased; or

(B) to the extent the Company, VZ Financing II, an Affiliate Covenant Party or such Restricted
Subsidiary elects to invest in or commit to invest in Additional Assets within 365 days from the
later of the date of such Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided,
_however, that any such reinvestment in Additional Assets made pursuant to a definitive agreement_
or a commitment approved by the Board of Directors or senior management of the Company that
is executed or approved within such time will satisfy this requirement, so long as such investment
is consummated within 6 months of such 365th day;

_provided that pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with clause_
(A) or clause (B) of this Section 4.10(a)(3), the Company, VZ Financing II, an Affiliate Covenant Party
and the Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or otherwise invest such Net
Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by this Agreement.

(b) Any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to be applied
as provided in Section 4.10(a)(3) will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds”. Notwithstanding
Section 4.10(a), to the extent that the Company, VZ Financing II, an Affiliate Covenant Party or the
Restricted Subsidiaries comply with the requirements of the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures (or
any similar terms in an instrument or agreement governing Senior Indebtedness) with respect to the
requirement to make an Asset Disposition Offer (as defined in the Existing Senior Secured Notes
Indentures) with Excess Proceeds, then the Company, VZ Financing II, any Affiliate Covenant Party and the
Restricted Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be in compliance with this Section 4.10.

(c) For the purposes of this Section 4.10, the following will be deemed to be cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee (or extinguishment of debt or liabilities in connection with the
transactions relating to such Asset Dispositions) of Indebtedness and any other liabilities (as recorded
on the balance sheet of t the Company, VZ Financing II, an Affiliate Covenant Party or any Restricted
Subsidiary or in the footnotes thereto, or if Incurred or accrued subsequent to the date of such balance
sheet, such liabilities that would have been reflected on such balance sheet or in the footnotes thereof if
such Incurrence or accrual had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet, as determined
conclusively in good faith by the Company, VZ Financing II, an Affiliate Covenant Party) (other than
Subordinated Obligations of the Company, VZ Financing II, an Affiliate Covenant Party or any
Restricted Subsidiary that is Guarantor) of the Company, VZ Financing II, an Affiliate Covenant Party

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company, VZ Financing II, an Affiliate Covenant
Party or any Restricted Subsidiary from the transferee that are convertible by the Company,

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction are not materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to the

except (1) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (x) Permitted Liens and
(y) that the Company, VZ Financing II, an Affiliate Covenant Party or a Restricted Subsidiary may create,
Incur, or suffer to exist, a Lien upon any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral (such Lien, the

A-63


-----

to secure the Indebtedness due under this Agreement or, in respect of Liens on an Affiliate Covenant Party’s
property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, such Affiliate Covenant Party’s Guarantee, equally and
ratably with (or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Obligations of the Company,
VZ Financing II, an Affiliate Covenant Party or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) the
Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured.

(b) Any Lien created pursuant to the proviso described in Section 4.12(a)(1) of the preceding paragraph in
favour of the Facilities will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (1) the

(c) For purposes of determining compliance with this Section 4.12, (i) a Lien need not be Incurred solely by
reference to one category of Permitted Liens or Permitted Collateral Liens, as applicable, but may be
Incurred under any combination of such categories (including in part under one such category and in part

one or more of such categories of Permitted Liens or Permitted Collateral Liens, as applicable, the
Company, VZ Financing II or an Affiliate Covenant Party shall, in its sole discretion, divide, classify or may
subsequently reclassify at any time such Lien (or any portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this

(e) With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time
of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of
such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of
such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the
amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with
the same terms or in the form of common stock, the payment of dividends on Preferred Stock in the form of
additional shares of Preferred Stock of the same class, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation
preference, any fees, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, premiums and other costs and
expenses incurred in connection therewith and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as
a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing
Indebtedness.

If, during any period after the Signing Date, the Facilities or the corporate rating of the VodafoneZiggo Group
have achieved and continue to maintain Investment Grade Status and no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing (such period hereinafter referred to as an “Investment Grade Status Period”), then the Company,

Clause 14.1 (Change of Control), the Company, VZ Financing II, and an Affiliate Covenant Party). No action
taken during an Investment Grade Status Period or prior to an Investment Grade Status Period in compliance with
the covenants then applicable will require reversal or constitute a Default under this Agreement in the event that
suspended covenants are subsequently reinstated or suspended, as the case may be. An Investment Grade Status
Period will terminate immediately upon the failure of the Facilities or the corporate rating of the VodafoneZiggo

**_Section 4.26 Limited Condition Transaction_**

(a) In connection with any action being taken in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction, for purposes
of determining compliance with any provision of this Agreement which requires that no Default or Event of
Default, as applicable, has occurred, is continuing or would result from any such action, as applicable, such
condition shall, at the option of the Company, VZ Financing II or an Affiliate Covenant Party, be deemed
satisfied, so long as no Default or Event of Default, as applicable, exists on the date the definitive agreement
(or other relevant definitive documentation) for such Limited Condition Transaction is entered into. For the
avoidance of doubt, if the Company, VZ Financing II or an Affiliate Covenant Party has exercised its option
under the first sentence of this Section 4.26(a), and any Default or Event of Default occurs following the
date such definitive agreement for a Limited Condition Transaction is entered into and prior to the
consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any such Default or Event of Default shall be
deemed to not have occurred or be continuing for purposes of determining whether any action being taken in
connection with such Limited Condition Transaction is permitted hereunder.

(b) In connection with any action being taken in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction for purposes
of:

(1) determining compliance with any provision of this Agreement which requires the calculation of any
financial ratio or test, including the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio; or

(2) testing baskets set forth in this Agreement (including baskets measured as a percentage or multiple, as
applicable, of Total Assets or Pro forma EBITDA);

in each case, at the option of the Company, VZ Financing II or an Affiliate Covenant Party (the Company’s,
VZ Financing II ’s or an Affiliate Covenant Party’s election to exercise such option in connection with any
Limited Condition Transaction, an “LCT Election”), the date of determination of whether any such action is
permitted hereunder, shall be deemed to be the date the definitive agreement (or other relevant definitive
documentation) for such Limited Condition Transaction is entered into (the “LCT Test Date”); provided,
however, that the Company, VZ Financing II or an Affiliate Covenant Party shall be entitled to subsequently
elect, in its sole discretion, the date of consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction instead of the LCT
Test Date as the applicable date of determination, and if, after giving pro forma effect to the Limited Condition
Transaction and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any Incurrence of
Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof), as are appropriate and consistent with the pro forma adjustment
provisions set forth in the definition of “Pro forma EBITDA” and “Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio”, the
Company, VZ Financing II, an Affiliate Covenant Party or any Restricted Subsidiary could have taken such
action on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with such ratio, test or basket, such ratio, test or basket shall
be deemed to have been complied with.

(c) If the Company, VZ Financing II or an Affiliate Covenant Party has made an LCT Election and any of the
ratios, tests or baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date are exceeded
as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio, test or basket, including due to fluctuations in Pro forma
EBITDA or Total Assets, of the Company, VZ Financing II, an Affiliate Covenant Party and the Restricted
Subsidiaries or the Person or assets subject to the Limited Condition Transaction (as at each reference to the
“Company”, “VZ Financing II ”, or “Affiliate Covenant Party”, as applicable), in such definition was to
such Person or assets) at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction or action, such baskets or
ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations. If the Company,
VZ Financing II or an Affiliate Covenant Party has made an LCT Election for any Limited Condition
Transaction, then in connection with any subsequent calculation of any ratio, test or basket availability
under the Indenture (including with respect to the Incurrence of Indebtedness or Liens, or the making of
Asset Dispositions, acquisitions, mergers, the conveyance, lease or other transfer of all or substantially all of
the assets of the Company, VZ Financing II, an Affiliate Covenant Party, or any Restricted Subsidiary or the

designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary) on or following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the
earlier of the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or the definitive agreement
for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated or expires without consummation of such Limited
Condition Transaction, any such ratio, test or basket shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming such
Limited Condition Transaction and other transactions in connection therewith (including any Incurrence of
Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) have been consummated.

and be continuing; and

(2) either:

the Administrator (acting on behalf of the Lender); or

(B) the Net Cash Proceeds of such transaction are applied in accordance with the applicable

applicable) instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets
of the Company, VZ Financing II, or an Affiliate Covenant Party (as applicable) on a consolidated basis,
shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company,
VZ Financing II, or an Affiliate Covenant Party (as applicable).

Covenant Party or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists, or is

Covenant Party, a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of

(other than a solvent winding up or liquidation in connection with a transfer of assets among the
Company, VZ Financing II, any Affiliate Covenant Party and the Restricted Subsidiaries) and, in each
case, such proceeding shall remain unstayed and in effect for a period of 30 consecutive days; or

Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements delivered
pursuant to Section 4.03), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (i) commences a voluntary case
(including taking any action for the purpose of winding up) under any applicable Bankruptcy Law, or
consents to the entry of an order for relief in an involuntary case under any such law, (ii) consents to
the appointment of or taking possession by a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee,
examiner, administrator, sequestrator or similar official of the Company, VZ Financing II, any Affiliate
Covenant Party, a Significant Subsidiary, or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of
the latest audited consolidated financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 4.03), would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary, or for all or substantially all of the property and assets of the
Company, VZ Financing II, any Affiliate Covenant Party, a Significant Subsidiary or group of
Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements
delivered pursuant to Section 4.03), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, or (iii) effects any
general assignment for the benefit of creditors;

(6) failure by the Company, VZ Financing II, any Affiliate Covenant Party or any Significant Subsidiary to
pay final judgments aggregating in excess of €100.0 million (net of any amounts that a solvent
insurance company has acknowledged liability for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed
for a period of 60 days (the “judgment default provision”); or

(7) any guarantee of the Finance Documents (pursuant to Clause 14 of this Agreement) of a Significant
Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (except in accordance with the terms of this Agreement)
or is declared invalid or unenforceable in a judicial proceeding and such Default continues for 30 days
after notice specified in this Agreement.

However, a default under Section 6.01(a)(3) or Section 6.01(7) will not constitute an Event of Default until
the Administrator (acting on behalf of the Lender) notifies the Company of the default and the Company does not
cure such default within the time specified in Section 6.01(a)(3) or Section 6.01(7) after receipt of such notice.

With respect to any Default or Event of Default, the words “exists”, “is continuing” or similar expressions
with respect thereto shall mean that the Default or Event of Default has occurred and has not yet been cured or
waived. If any Default or Event of Default occurs due to (a) the failure by any person to take any action by a
specified time, such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to have been cured at the time, if any, that the
applicable person takes such action or (b) the taking of any action by any person that is not then permitted by the
terms of this Agreement or any other Finance Document, such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to be
cured on the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which such action would be permitted at such time to be taken
under this Agreement and the other Finance Documents and (ii) the date on which such action is unwound or
otherwise modified to the extent necessary for such revised action to be permitted at such time by this Agreement
and the other Finance Documents. If any Default or Event of Default occurs that is subsequently cured (a “Cured
**Default”), any other subsequent Default or Event of Default resulting from the taking or omitting to take any**
action by any person, which subsequent Default or Event of Default would not have arisen had the Cured Default
not occurred, shall be deemed to be cured automatically upon, and simultaneously with, the cure of the Cured
Default. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph, a Default or Event of Default (the “Initial
**Default”) may not be cured pursuant to this paragraph, in the case of an Initial Default described in clause (b) of**
the second sentence of this paragraph, if an Officer of the Company, VZ Financing II, any Affiliate Covenant
Party had Knowledge at the time of taking any such action that such Initial Default had occurred and was
continuing.

For purposes of the paragraph above, “Knowledge” shall mean, with respect to an Officer of the Company,
VZ Financing II or any Affiliate Covenant Party, (i) the actual knowledge of such individual or (ii) the
knowledge that such individual would have obtained if such individual had acted in good faith to discharge his or
her duties with the same level of diligence and care as would reasonably be expected from an officer in a
substantially similar position.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with an Initial Default then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a
failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without
any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods under
Section 4.03, or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of this Agreement
shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or
certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the
Agreement.
