# €850 million 3% Senior Notes due 2027 issued by

### Intrum AB (publ)

Intrum AB (publ) (formerly Intrum Justitia AB (publ)), a Swedish public limited liability company (the “Issuer”), is offering €850 million in aggregate
principal amount of its 3% Senior Notes due 2027 (the “Notes”).

The Notes will mature on September 15, 2027. The Issuer will pay interest on the Notes semi-annually on each March 15 and September 15,
commencing on March 15, 2020. Prior to September 15, 2022, the Issuer may, at its option, redeem all or a portion of the Notes by paying the
relevant “make-whole” premium. At any time and from time to time on or after September 15, 2022, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes
at the redemption prices set forth herein. In addition, prior to September 15, 2022, the Issuer may, at its option, redeem up to 40% of the Notes with
the net proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth herein.

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a defined change of control, or if the Issuer sells certain of its assets, the Issuer may be required
to make an offer to purchase the Notes. In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of
the Notes.

The Notes will be general, senior obligations of the Issuer, will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s existing and future indebtedness
that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, and will rank senior in right of payment to any and all of the existing and future indebtedness
of the Issuer that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes. The Notes will be unsecured and will be effectively subordinated to
any existing and future secured indebtedness of the Issuer, including any amounts owing under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Intrum Existing
Private Placement Notes, the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility (upon granting of security) (each as defined herein) and certain hedging
arrangements, to the extent of the value of assets securing such indebtedness. The Notes will not initially be guaranteed by any of the Issuer’s
subsidiaries and will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness of such subsidiaries, including such subsidiaries’ obligations
under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility (upon granting of guarantees).

The Notes will be listed on the Securities Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”). There can be no assurance that
such listing will be maintained.

The Notes will be issued in the form of one or more global notes in book-entry form. The Issuer expects that the Notes will be deposited and
registered in the name of a nominee for a common depositary for Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking S.A.
(“Clearstream”) on or about the Issue Date.

The Notes will initially be held in global registered form in minimum denominations of at least €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 thereof.

**See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 27 for a discussion of certain risks that you should consider in connection with an investment in**
**the Notes.**

Price for the Notes: 100.000% plus accrued interest, if any, from the Issue Date

The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “U.S. Securities Act”), or the securities
laws of any other jurisdiction. The Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account of, U.S. persons, except
pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. In the United States, this
offering is being made only to “qualified institutional buyers” (as defined under Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act (“Rule 144A”)) (a “QIB”).
Outside of the United States, this offering is being made to certain non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions within the meaning of and in reliance
on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act (“Regulation S”). You are hereby notified that sellers of the Notes may be relying on the exemption
from the provisions of Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. See “Important Information about this Offering Memorandum” for
further details about eligible offerees and “Transfer Restrictions” for transfer and resale restrictions.

_par les présentes qu’il(elle) a expressément exigé que tous les documents faisant foi ou se rapportant_

**_European Economic Area. This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that all offers_**
of the Notes will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the
requirement to produce a prospectus for offers of the Notes. The expression “Prospectus Regulation”

iii


-----

means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended), and includes any relevant implementing measure in
each member state (“EEA Member State”) of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”).

Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer within the EEA of the Notes should only
do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for us or the Initial Purchasers to produce a
prospectus for such offer. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do authorize, the
making of any offer of Notes through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial
Purchasers, which constitute the final placement of the Notes contemplated in this Offering
Memorandum.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a “retail investor”
means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive
2016/97/EU (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a “qualified
investor” as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document required
by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the
Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and
therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the
EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

For the purposes of this section, the expression an “offer of Notes to the public” in relation to any Notes
in any EEA Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient
information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide
to purchase or subscribe the Notes, as the same may be varied in that EEA Member State by any
measure implementing the Prospectus Regulation in that EEA Member State.

Professional investors and ECPs (as defined below) only target market: Solely for the purposes of the
product approval process of each of DNB Bank ASA, Goldman Sachs International, J.P. Morgan
Securities plc, Nykredit Bank A/S, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (publ), Swedbank AB (publ) and
UBS Europe SE as Joint Bookrunners of the Notes (each a “Manufacturer”), the target market
assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is
eligible counterparties (“ECPs”) and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all
channels for distribution of the Notes to ECPs and professional clients are appropriate. Any person
subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the Manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, and without prejudice to our
obligations in accordance with MiFID II, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking
its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the
Manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**_France. This Offering Memorandum has not been prepared and is not being distributed in the context_**
of an offer to the public of financial securities in France within the meaning of Article L.411 1 of the
French Code monétaire et financier and Title 1 of Book II of the Règlement Général de l’Autorité des
_Marchés Financiers, and has not been approved by, registered or filed with the Autorité des marchés_
_financiers_ (the “AMF”), nor any competent authority of another EEA Member State that would have
notified its approval to the AMF under the Prospectus Regulation as implemented in France and in any
relevant EEA Member State. Therefore, the Notes may not be, directly or indirectly, offered or caused
to be offered or sold to the public in France (offre au public de titres financiers) and this Offering
Memorandum and any other offering or marketing material or information relating to the Notes has not
been and will not be released, issued or distributed or caused to be released, issued or distributed to
the public in France or used in connection with any offer for subscription or sales of the Notes to the
public in France in any way that would constitute, directly or indirectly, an offer to the public in France.
Offers, sales and distributions have only been and shall only be made in France to qualified investors
(investisseurs qualifiés) acting solely for their own account (agissant pour compte propre) and/or to
providers of investment services relating to portfolio management for the account of third parties
(personnes fournissant le service d’investissement de gestion de portefeuille pour compte de tiers), all
as defined in and in accordance with Articles L.411 1, L.411 2, D.411 1, D.411 4, D.744 1, D.754 1 and
D.764 1 of the French Code monétaire et financier. Prospective investors are informed that (a) this
Offering Memorandum has not been and will not be submitted for clearance to the AMF, (b) in

other applicable German law. No application will be made under German law to permit a public offer of
the Notes in the Federal Republic of Germany. This Offering Memorandum has not been approved for
purposes of a public offer of the Notes and accordingly the Notes may not be, and are not being, offered
or advertised publicly or by public promotion in the Federal Republic of Germany. Therefore, this
Offering Memorandum is strictly for private use and the offer is only being made to recipients to whom
the document is personally addressed and does not constitute an offer or advertisement to the public.

relation to the Notes is directed only at, persons who are qualified investors (qualifizierte Anleger) within
the meaning of Section 2 No. 6 of the German Securities Prospectus Act. Any resale of the Notes in
the Federal Republic of Germany must be made only in accordance with the German Securities
Prospectus Act and other applicable laws. The Issuer has not, and does not intend to, file a securities
prospectus with the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt für
_Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht) (“BaFin”) or obtain a notification to the BaFin from another competent_
authority of an EEA Member State.

**_The Netherlands._** The Notes which are the subject of the offering contemplated by this Offering
Memorandum are not and may not be offered or sold in the Netherlands other than to persons or entities
which are qualified investors (gekwalificeerde beleggers) as defined in section 1:1 of the Dutch Financial
Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht or the “AFS”). Each purchaser of the Notes described
in this Offering Memorandum located in the Netherlands will be deemed to have represented,
acknowledged and agreed that it is a qualified investor (gekwalificeerde belegger) as defined in section
1:1 of the AFS. For the purposes of this provision, the expression “an offer of the Notes to the public”
in relation to any Notes in the Netherlands means to make a sufficiently specific offer addressed to more
than one person as referred to in section 217(1) of Book 6 of the Dutch Civil Code to conclude a contract
to purchase or otherwise acquire the Notes, or to issue an invitation to make an offer of the Notes.

**_Norway. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus and has not been prepared in accordance with_**

fact or present facts or circumstances. The words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “may,”
“plan,” “estimate,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “aim” or “might” and similar expressions or the negatives of
these expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Other forward-looking
statements can be identified in the context in which the statements are made. Forward-looking
statements occur in a number of places in this Offering Memorandum, including, without limitation, in
the sections entitled “Summary,” “Risk Factors,” “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations,” “Industry Overview” and “Business” and include, among other_

- the outcome of legal proceedings.

Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable,
we can provide no assurances that such expectations will prove to be correct and that such statements
are guarantees of future performance because they are based on numerous assumptions. Any forwardlooking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made and we undertake no obligation to
publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise. Important risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause these differences
include, but are not limited to:

- changes in the economic conditions or trends in the markets in which we operate;

vii


-----

- inability to compete with businesses that may offer more attractive prices or have greater financing
resources;

- insufficient supply of portfolios to purchase and willingness of clients to outsource their credit
management services to us;

- reliance on clients in the financial services industry and risk of material failures in banking systems;

- errors in our collection process or other operational matters, such as failure of third parties as part
of the supply chain to provide certain services;

- inability to maintain, manage, integrate and develop our IT or data analysis systems or anticipate,
manage or adopt technological advances within our industry;

- failure to maintain IT security or protect our data analysis system;

- failure to adequately protect our clients’ sensitive data;

- negative impact of litigations, investigations and other proceedings;

- the effect of recent or future tax changes in jurisdictions in which we operate or are otherwise tax
resident;

- inability to recoup our costs of investment upon the sale of our portfolios; and

- our substantial leverage and debt service obligations and ability to effectively operate our business
within the restrictions imposed by the terms of our existing or future indebtedness.

Additional factors that could cause our actual results or performance to differ materially, include, but are
not limited to, those discussed under “Risk Factors.”

These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. We
expressly undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether

as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, other than as required by law or regulation.
You should interpret all subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or to
persons acting on our behalf as being qualified by the cautionary statements in this Offering
Memorandum. Accordingly, prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any of
the forward-looking statements herein.

This Offering Memorandum contains certain synergy and operational efficiency improvements
estimates as well as costs related to implementing such measures. Such estimates are based on a
number of assumptions made in reliance on the information available to us and management’s
judgments based on such information. The assumptions used in estimating synergies, operational
efficiency improvements and related costs are inherently uncertain and are subject to a variety of
significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results
to differ materially from those contained in any synergy benefit or operational efficiency improvements
estimates. See “Risk Factors— Risks related to our industry and business—Acquisitions or carve-out
_transactions may prove unsuccessful or strain or divert our resources and we may not be able to_
_manage our growth effectively” and_ _“Risk Factors—Risks related to our industry and business—_
_Anticipated synergies from the Merger or operational efficiency improvements from continued efficiency_
_improvements programs may not materialize.”_

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**Financial information**

**_Issuer’s Financial Statements_**

This Offering Memorandum contains the following financial information of the Issuer:

- the audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto of the Issuer as
of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (including comparative information as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2016), which have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”) and
audited by the Issuer’s independent auditors, Ernst & Young AB, as set forth in their audit reports
included elsewhere herein (the “Issuer’s Audited Financial Statements”);

- the unaudited consolidated interim financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto of the
Issuer as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2019 (including comparative information as of
and for the six months ended June 30, 2018), which have been reviewed by the Issuer’s
independent auditors, Ernst & Young AB, and for the six months ended June 30 2018 (including
comparative information as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2017), each of which have
been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 (the “Issuer’s Interim Financial Statements” and,
together with the Issuer’s Audited Financial Statements, the “Issuer’s Financial Statements”).

_Factors impacting comparability_

_IFRS 5_

In November 2017, in connection with the Divestment, the Issuer agreed to divest certain subsidiaries
to a company in the Lowell Group. The Divestment completed on March 20, 2018. In the income
statement for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the six and twelve months ended
June 30, 2018, the subsidiaries being divested in accordance with the above have been reported as
discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued
Operations. In the balance sheet as of December 31, 2017, these subsidiaries are reported as assets
and liabilities in operations held for sale. For further information, see note 39 in the Issuer’s audited
financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 included elsewhere
in this Offering Memorandum.

_IFRS 9_

With effect from January 1, 2018, in accordance with the rules for loans and receivables under IFRS 9,
which replaced IAS 39 (or, for any annual periods prior to January 1, 2018, according to IAS 39),
portfolio investments are recognized at amortized cost according to the effective interest model. The
new rules for portfolio investments require that we continue to report these according to an EIR model,
with minor adjustments in application. The primary change is that, in accordance with IFRS 9, acquired
credit-impaired receivables can be reported at a higher recognized value than cost if our estimates of
future cash flows change, which differs from our application of the corresponding rules under IAS 39.

_IFRS 15 and IFRS 16_

We adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers from January 1, 2018 and IFRS 16
(Leases) from January 1, 2019. Our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2017 and unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the twelve
months ended June 30, 2018 have not been restated to reflect the retrospective adoption of IFRS 15.
None of the Issuer’s Audited Financial Statements, the Issuer’s unaudited consolidated financial
statements as of and for the six and twelve months ended June 30, 2018 or the Issuer’s unaudited
consolidated financial statements for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 have been restated to
reflect the retrospective adoption of IFRS 16. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information”,
“Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition—Significant factors affecting
_comparability—Significant accounting policies” and note 1 to the Issuer’s audited consolidated financial_
statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum.

_Lindorff’s income statement information and unaudited pro forma financial information_

On June 27, 2017, the Issuer completed the acquisition of the entire issued share capital of Lindorff
pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. The Issuer’s audited consolidated financial statements
for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 contain certain income statement information for
Lindorff for the period January 1, 2017 to June 27, 2017 and January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016,
respectively, and the Issuer’s audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December
31, 2018 and 2017 and the Issuer’s unaudited consolidated financial statements for the six months
ended June 30 2018 (including comparative information as of and for the six months ended June 30,
2017) contain certain pro forma information to give effect to the Merger. Such historical and pro forma
information (a) has not been prepared in relation to this Offering, (b) has not been audited or reviewed
by the Issuer’s independent auditors, (c) has not been prepared in accordance with SEC requirements,
IFRS or generally accepted accounting principles in use in any other jurisdiction, (d) does not include
all the information required for financial statements under IFRS or SEC requirements and (e) is based
on assumptions that were reasonable at the time of making such assumptions but which may have
changed as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. As a result, this information is inherently subject
to risks and uncertainties and may not give an accurate or complete picture of our future results of
operations or may not be comparable to the Issuer’s Financial Statements or the other financial
information included in this Offering Memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an
investment decision. In addition, our historical results may not be indicative of our future results.

**_Segments, service lines and geographic regions_**

The Issuer includes segmental results in their financial statements with the segments defined in
accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments in each case.

In the year ended December 31, 2017, the Issuer’s operating segments were comprised of four
geographical regions in which its clients are located: (i) Northern Europe (including Denmark, Estonia,
Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Norway and Sweden), (ii) Central and Eastern Europe (including Greece,
Poland, Romania, Switzerland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary and Austria), (iii)
Western and Southern Europe (including Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and
the United Kingdom and (iv) Spain. Effective September 1, 2018, the Iberian Peninsula and Latin
America geographical region was created, comprising operations in Spain, Portugal and Brazil.
Accordingly, the operations in Portugal are no longer included in the Western and Southern Europe
Region. Comparison figures for the year ended December 31, 2017 have been recalculated in
accordance with the new region structure. Central and common expenses are spread across the
geographical regions in proportion to their purchasing power parity-adjusted revenues.

In addition, the Issuer also reports certain results by service offering, which is divided into two service
lines: (i) Credit Management Services (“CMS”), which focus on late payments and collection, collection
services, credit information services and payment services; and (ii) portfolio investments, which
predominantly includes the acquisition of portfolios of overdue receivables at less than their nominal
value, after which Intrum collects the receivables on its own behalf, and real estate acquisitions,
primarily through the seizure of collateral for purchased covered receivables, other financing services
and payment guarantees. See Note 2 to the Issuer’s Audited Financial Statements presented elsewhere
herein.

**LTM financial information**

This Offering Memorandum includes certain unaudited financial information for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. This financial information has been calculated by adding the Issuer’s
historical results for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, to the Issuer’s
historical results for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and subtracting the
Issuer’s historical results for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 respectively (the “LTM
**Information”). The LTM Information has been prepared solely for the purposes of this Offering**
Memorandum, is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting, has not been audited or
reviewed and does not reflect the application of IFRS 15 or IFRS 16 over the entire period. See
“Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Significant
_factors affecting comparability—Significant Accounting Policies.” The LTM Information is for illustrative_
purposes only, to provide a comparable period on period discussion after the Merger, and is not

xi


-----

necessarily representative of the Issuer’s results of operations for any future period or the Issuer’s
financial condition at any future date.

**Unaudited pro forma financial information**

We present in this Offering Memorandum _Pro Forma_ Cash EBITDA, which is calculated as Cash
EBITDA further adjusted for the impact of (i) certain non-recurring items that are not included in our
normally recurring operations and that are not expected to recur on a regular basis, including costs
associated with implementing synergy programs in connection with the Merger, (ii) participations in
associated companies and joint ventures excluding dividend and (iii) significant acquisitions made
during the period under review. The pro forma and adjusted data has not been and cannot be audited,
reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm. This information is inherently subject to risks
and uncertainties and may not give an accurate or complete picture of our future results of operations
or may not be comparable to the Issuer’s Financial Statements or the other financial information
included in this Offering Memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an investment
decision. Our historical results may not be indicative of our future results. The unaudited _pro forma_
financial data has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S.
Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation or any generally accepted accounting standards. Neither the
assumptions underlying the _pro forma_ adjustments nor the resulting _pro forma_ financial information
have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted accounting standards.

**Non-IFRS financial measures**

In this Offering Memorandum, we present EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Cash EBITDA and _Pro Forma_
Cash EBITDA as we believe they are helpful to investors as measures of our operating performance
and ability to service our debt. These measures are not measures of financial performance under IFRS
and should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash
flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS, and they may not
accurately reflect our performance, liquidity or our ability to incur or service debt. EBITDA, EBITDA
Margin, Cash EBITDA and Pro Forma Cash EBITDA are used by management as indicators of our
operating performance.

- “EBIT” means profit and loss for the period before taxes and net financial items.

- “EBITDA” means profit and loss for the period before taxes, net financial items discontinued
operations and depreciation on fixed assets.

- “EBITDA Margin” represents EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.

- “Cash EBITDA” means EBITDA before amortization and revaluations of portfolio investments.
Cash EBITDA is calculated by adding back amortization and revaluation of portfolio investments to
EBITDA.

- _“Pro Forma Cash EBITDA” means Cash EBITDA further adjusted for the impact of (i) certain non-_
recurring items that are not included in our normally recurring operations and that are not expected
to recur on a regular basis, including costs associated with implementing synergy programs in
connection with the Merger, (ii) participations in associated companies and joint ventures excluding
dividend and (iii) the _pro forma_ effect of significant acquisitions made during the period under
review. See “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data—Other Financial
_Information and Operating Data.”_

For a reconciliation of EBITDA, Cash EBITDA and Pro Forma Cash EBITDA to profit and loss for the
period and/or cash flow from operating activities as presented in the Issuer’s Financial Statements see
“Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data.” Non-recurring items include certain costs
and other items that management views as not expected to return on a regular basis however there
can be no assurance that certain of these items will not recur in any given subsequent period.

The non-IFRS financial measures presented herein are not recognized measures of financial
performance under IFRS, but measures used by management to monitor the underlying performance
of our business and operations. In particular, the non-IFRS financial measures should not be viewed as
substitutes for revenue, other income, results from operating activities (EBIT), profit/(loss) for the period,

xii


-----

cash flows from operating activities at period end or other income statement or cash flow items
computed in accordance with IFRS. The non-IFRS financial measures do not necessarily indicate
whether cash flow will be sufficient or available to meet our cash requirements and may not be indicative
of our historical operating results, nor are such measures meant to be predictive of our future results.
EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Cash EBITDA and Pro Forma Cash EBITDA have limitations as analytical
tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for, an analysis of our results as
reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are:

- they do not reflect cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual
commitments;

- they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs;

- they do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service
interest or principal payments on debt; and

- although depreciation, amortization and impairment are non-cash charges, the assets being
depreciated and amortized will generally need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA, EBITDA
Margin, Cash EBITDA and _Pro Forma_ Cash EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements that
would be required for such replacements.

We have presented these non-IFRS measures in this Offering Memorandum because we consider them
to be important supplemental measures of our performance and believe that they are widely used by
investors comparing performance between companies. Since not all companies compute these or other
non-IFRS financial measures in the same way, the manner in which our management has chosen to
compute the non-IFRS financial measures presented herein may not be comparable with similarly
defined terms used by other companies.

This Offering Memorandum contains certain synergy and operational efficiency improvement estimates,
among others, relating to cost reductions and other benefits (including those expected to arise from the
Merger and our continued operational efficiency program) as well as costs related to implementing such
measures. Such estimates are based on a number of assumptions made in reliance on the information
available to us and management’s judgments based on such information. The assumptions used in
estimating the synergies, operational efficiency improvements and related costs are inherently
uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the synergy
benefit and operational efficiency improvement estimates. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to our
_industry and business—Acquisitions or carve-out transactions may prove unsuccessful or strain or_
_divert our resources and we may not be able to manage our growth effectively” and “Risk Factors—_
_Risks related to our industry and business—Anticipated synergies from the Merger or operational_
_efficiency improvements from continued efficiency improvements programs may not materialize.”_

The non-IFRS measures presented in this Offering Memorandum should not be considered as
alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measures of
performance derived in accordance with IFRS and have not been prepared in accordance with SEC
requirements, IFRS or the generally accepted accounting principles in use in any other jurisdiction. The
financial information included in this Offering Memorandum is not intended to comply with the reporting
requirements of the SEC and will not be subject to review by the SEC. In making an investment decision,
investors should rely upon their own examination of the terms of the Offering and the financial
information contained in this Offering Memorandum.

**Other**

The Issuer’s Financial Statements are presented in Swedish kronor (“SEK”). Amounts included in the
Issuer’s Financial Statements that were not originally denominated in SEK have been translated into
SEK using the average exchange rate for the financial period with respect to the income statement and
the period-end exchange rate with respect to statement of financial position items.

For informational purposes only, certain financial information of the Issuer presented in SEK (i) for the
twelve months ended June 30, 2019 has been converted to euro at an exchange rate of SEK 10.4471
to €1.00, which represents the average Sveriges Riksbank Daily Reference Rate (as defined herein)

xiii


-----

for the twelve month period ended June 30, 2019, (ii) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, has
been converted to euro at an exchange rate of SEK 9.9131 to 1.00, which represents the average of
the monthly exchange rates for the twelve month period ended June 30, 2018, published by Sveriges
Riksbank, and (iii) as of June 30, 2019, has been converted to euro at an exchange rate of SEK 10.5581
to 1.00, which represents the closing exchange rate as of June 30, 2019, published by Sveriges
Riksbank, which may differ from the exchange rate used in the Issuer’s Financial Statements as of
September 10, 2019 and the Issue Date. See “Exchange Rates.”

For presentational purposes only, certain amounts under “Capitalization” and “Use of Proceeds” and
any amounts derived therefrom) denominated in euro has been converted into SEK at a rate of SEK
10.5458 to €1.00 which is the exchange rate used by the Issuer for balance sheet purposes as of June
30, 2019, and which differs from the convenience exchange rate used elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum and may differ from the exchange rate as of September 10, 2019 and the Issue Date.

**Key operating metrics**

In this Offering Memorandum, we present various key operating metrics. We believe that these metrics
are helpful in understanding our performance from period to period and facilitate comparison with our
peers. These metrics are not measures of financial performance under IFRS and should not be
considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other
measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS. The key operating metrics included in this
Offering Memorandum are defined as follows:

- **Average collection of forecasts:** average collection of forecasts is the gross collections on
portfolio investments divided by the (latest) active forecast, on a rolling twelve-month basis.

- **Collection cost ratio:** collection cost ratio, in relation to debt purchasing, is the cost to collect
relative to gross collections.

- **Effective Interest Rate (“EIR”): under IFRS, EIR is the effective interest rate that exactly discounts**
estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or,
when appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial
liability. This means that the EIR is set based on the ERC (as defined below) at the date of purchase
and the portfolio’s purchase price.

- **Estimated Remaining Collections (“ERC”):** ERC is the nominal value of estimated remaining
collections on portfolio investments plus ERC contributions from each of the portfolios of loans and
other overdue receivables purchased through co-investor agreements in proportion to our relative
ownership interest in each such portfolio. ERC is calculated as of a point in time, assuming no
additional purchases are made thereafter. These expectations are based on historical and current
portfolio collection performance data, and trends and assumptions about future debt collection
rates. There can be no assurances that such collections will be achieved within the specified time
periods, or at all. ERC is a measure that is also often used by other companies in the credit
management industry. However, it may be calculated differently by other companies. ERC is
presented because it represents an estimate of the anticipated future cash collections on our
portfolio investments at any point in time, which is an important supplemental measure used by our
management to assess our performance, and underscores the cash generation capacity of the
assets backing our business. We use ERC as the business case forecast horizon when purchasing
portfolios. We also use it for accounting purposes and because it is used under the instruments or
agreements governing our indebtedness to monitor our performance when the lenders are
providing funding of portfolio purchases. In this Offering Memorandum we present ERC, which is
our estimated remaining debt collections on our portfolio investments over an 180 month period.
However, for the purpose of the covenants under the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, ERC will be measured over an 84 month period. See “Description of the Notes.”

- **Gross cash-on-cash multiple: gross cash-on-cash multiple is the actual gross collections to date,**
plus the ERC as of the same date divided by the total amount paid for the portfolio at the date of
purchase.

- **Gross collections on portfolio investments: gross collections on portfolio investments is the total**
principal, interest, collection fees and legal fees received on portfolios that we own or, in the case

xiv


-----

of debt purchased through co-investment agreements, a share of the aggregate gross collections
on portfolio investments equal to our relative ownership interest in such portfolio investments.

- **Portfolio investments: portfolio investments consists of portfolios of delinquent consumer debts,**
loans, overdue trade receivables (“OTR”) and other receivables purchased at prices below the
nominal receivable. As used in this Offering Memorandum, “portfolio investments” and “loans and
other overdue receivables” may be used interchangeably, as the context requires.

- **Portfolio investments book value: portfolio investments book value is the amount recognized in**
the balance sheet. The book value of each portfolio corresponds to the present value of estimated
future cash flows discounted by the applicable EIR. Portfolio investments book value represents
the aggregate book value of portfolios of purchased loans and receivables as of the dates
presented. With respect to co-investment portfolios that we do not exercise control over, only the
proportionate share of the portfolio corresponding to our investment is recorded on the balance
sheet.

- **Return on portfolio investments: return on portfolio investments is the earnings on the portfolio**
investments component of the business for the period, excluding factoring and payment
guarantees, recalculated on a full-year basis, as a percentage of the average carrying amount of
the balance-sheet item Portfolio Investments. The average carrying amount of the balance-sheet
item Portfolio Investments is calculated by adding together the opening and closing balance for the
last quarter and dividing by two.

- **Segment earnings: segment earnings is calculated on a segment basis and is the total operating**
revenue of the segment less the direct operating expenses attributable to the respective segment.

- **Segment earnings margin: segment earnings margin is calculated on a segment basis and is the**
segment earnings of the segment as a percentage of total operating revenue of the respective
segment.

- **Service line earnings: service line earnings is calculated on a service line basis and is the total**
operating revenue of the service line less the direct operating expenses attributable to the
respective service line. The Issuer includes depreciation and amortization of fixed assets among
operating expenses that are attributable to these service lines.

- **Service line earnings margin: service line earnings margin is calculated on a service line basis**
and is the service line earnings of the service line as a percentage of total operating revenue of the
respective service line.

- **Total collectible value on portfolio investment: total collectible value on portfolio investments is**
calculated as the total principal plus interest and fees added to the receivable on portfolio
investments.

- **Total collectible value on third-party debt: total collectible value on third-party debt is the total**
principal plus interest and fees added to the receivable on third-party debt.

**PRESENTATION OF INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

This Offering Memorandum contains statistics, data and other information relating to markets, market
sizes, market shares, market positions and other industry data pertaining to our business and markets.
Unless otherwise indicated, such information is based on our analysis of multiple sources. Such
information has been accurately reproduced, and, as far as we are aware from such information, no
facts have been omitted which would render the information provided inaccurate or misleading.

Industry publications or reports generally state that the information they contain has been obtained from
sources believed to be reliable, but the accuracy and completeness of such information is not
guaranteed. We have not independently verified and cannot give any assurance as to the accuracy of
market data contained in this Offering Memorandum that were extracted or derived from these industry
publications or reports. Market data and statistics are inherently predictive and subject to uncertainty
and not necessarily reflective of actual market conditions. Such statistics are based on market research,
which itself is based on sampling and subjective judgments by both the researchers and the
respondents, including judgments about what types of products and transactions should be included in
the relevant market.

This Offering Memorandum also contains estimates of market data and information derived therefrom
that cannot be gathered from publications by market research institutions or any other independent
sources. Such information is prepared by us based on third-party sources and our own internal
estimates, including studies of the market that we have commissioned. In many cases there is no
publicly available information on such market data, for example from industry associations, public
authorities or other organizations and institutions. We believe that our estimates of market data and
information derived therefrom are helpful in order to give investors a better understanding of the industry
in which we operate as well as our position within the industry. Although we believe that our internal
market observations are reliable, our own estimates are not reviewed or verified by any external
sources. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding the industry or similar data presented
herein, such data involves risks and uncertainties and is subject to change based on various factors,
including those discussed under the headings “Presentation of Financial and Other Information” and
“Risk Factors” in this Offering Memorandum.

Statements regarding the Company’s position as the leading credit management company in Europe
and the largest pan-European credit management company are based on reported information among
European peer companies for a number of metrics (such as revenue, EBITDA and portfolio investments
book value). However, in certain instances such metrics may be calculated differently by our
competitors and therefore may not be directly comparable. Statements regarding European bank nonperforming loan (“NPL”) stock are based on European Banking Authority (“EBA”) data. This figure (i)
does not include NPLs held by non-bank entities and therefore does not include large volumes of NPLs

sold over the years to credit funds or debt purchasers such as ourselves and (ii) includes NPLs relating
to the large corporate segment, which we compete in on an opportunistic basis, as well as corporate
debt (“B2B”) to SMEs, both of which are not part of our Core Addressable Market (as defined herein),
which comprises all consumer debt originated by financial institutions. As a result, the stock of the NPLs
in our Core Addressable Market is significantly smaller than our Addressable Market (as defined herein).

**Overview**

We are the largest European credit management company, providing a complete service offering, by
revenue, EBITDA and ERC, with operations in 24 European countries. Based on internal estimates, we
believe we hold a leading position in a majority of those countries. We provide our clients with a
balanced and integrated mix of services across the entire credit management value chain, including
credit management services and financial services, building upon our longstanding commitment to fair
collection. The economies of scale that we are able to leverage due to our size and our focus on
digitization and information analysis, combined with significant recent strategic transactions, has
allowed us to maintain our strategic focus on both growth and increased efficiency. Our entry in 2018
into a strategic partnership with Banca Intesa Sanpaolo established us as a leading player in late
payments in Italy, one of Europe’s most attractive markets, and our purchase of a real estate portfolio
from Ibercaja Banco SA (“Ibercaja”) along with our acquisition of Solvia Servicios Inmobiliaros
(“Solvia”), a leading supplier of real estate services in Spain, has cemented our leading position in
Spain in real estate servicing (“RES”), which involves servicing of loans related to properties and other
services related to the security/property owned by clients. In 2018, we also implemented our first minor
acquisition in Brazil, allowing us to further expand geographically and to explore the Brazilian market.

We provide two services to customers through our Credit Management Services (“CMS”) service line
and Portfolio Investments service line to ensure that companies that sell products, services or credit are
paid:

**_CMS service line. We employ tailored debt collection strategies and solutions to maximize cash flow_**
streams from loans and other overdue receivables for clients who have decided to outsource their debt
collection function. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, we generated net revenue of SEK
7,443 million (€712 million equivalent) from CMS, excluding revenue generated from portfolios of loans
and other overdue receivables that we own. We also provide leading capabilities in alternative solutions,
such as carve-outs, which involves taking over the in-house collection platform of financial institutions
clients and conducting debt collection on behalf of the financial institutions under a long-term contract
as well as RES.

In addition to, and generally in combination with, collection services, we provide clients with a wide
range of value-added services, prior to loans and receivables becoming overdue, including customer
and credit information and analysis on individuals and companies across Europe to help our clients
assess their potential customers’ payment capacity, data extraction and modelling, selection and
scoring of potential customers, and a full suite of services relating to accounts receivable, including
invoicing, reminders and account ledger services.

**_Portfolio Investments service line._** We offer a range of portfolio investment financial services,
including relating to real estate acquisitions and debt servicing. In particular, we purchase portfolios of
secured and unsecured loans and other overdue receivables from our clients for a portion of the nominal
value, which we then service using our in-house debt collection function, with a few exceptions.
Following the purchase of the defaulted receivables, our long-term debt collection measures
commence, aimed at helping consumers become debt-free as we help them reduce their debt in a
respectful manner, for example through instalment plans that take account of each consumer’s payment
capacity. We also, either in the course of recovery activities for secured loans (or, infrequently, in
relation to unsecured loans with personal guarantees) or as a standalone investment strategy, directly
or indirectly and independently or alongside co-investors, hold title to real estate that we expect to
eventually resell. We arrange for the sale of such real estate using internal and external resources and
networks. Our real estate exposure is concentrated in Spain, Italy, Portugal and Hungary and, together

1


-----

with properties held by joint ventures in which we participate along with our co-investors, totals
approximately 6,000 properties with a book value of €259 million as of June 30, 2019. For the twelve
months ended June 30, 2019, we generated revenue of SEK 6,790 million (€650 million equivalent)
from our Portfolio Investments service line. As of June 30, 2019, the ERC of our portfolios of loans and
overdue receivables was SEK 60,896 million (€5,768 million equivalent). As part of our Portfolio
Investments service line, we also provide factoring, payment guarantees and e-commerce services.

We believe that the combination of portfolio investments and debt collection has been and will continue
to be key to our success. Our range of services helps attract and retain clients and increases the breadth
and depth of collectible data, in turn supporting the creation of tailored collection strategies and
development of analytical capabilities to enable more accurate pricing of portfolios. Operating across
Europe and with a balanced business model also gives us investment optionality as we can allocate
resources across our platform and jurisdictions to the opportunities that we find most attractive. For the
twelve months ended June 30, 2019, our revenue was SEK 14,233 million (€1,362 million equivalent)
and _Pro Forma_ Cash EBITDA was SEK 10,370 million (€993 million equivalent). See “Summary
_Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data.”_

**Our Strengths**

We believe that our business benefits from a number of key strengths, including:

**_Europe’s leading credit management company_**

_The largest credit management company in Europe_

We are the largest European credit management company, providing a complete service offering, by
revenue, EBITDA and ERC. We are significantly larger than the second largest such credit management
company in Europe. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, our Cash EBITDA was SEK 9,655
million (€924 million equivalent) and our Pro Forma Cash EBITDA was SEK 10,370 million (€993 million
equivalent). We believe our size gives us several benefits. In particular, our broad and in-depth
experience favorably impacts our ability to develop optimal collection strategies and competitively price
portfolios in our portfolio investment activities, which we believe has a positive impact on our revenue
and efficiency. Additionally, our size allows us to better absorb fixed costs, compared to smaller
companies, including those related to regulatory and legal compliance and information technology (“IT”),
which further benefits our margins. We also believe that our scale, leading positions, full scope of
services across the CMS value chain and broad geographic footprint make us increasingly relevant for
our largest clients, provides us with increasing sources of opportunities across Europe and enables us
to efficiently allocate capital to opportunities with the best risk/reward profiles.

_Market leading position in several European countries_

We are present in 24 European countries, which is more than any of our European competitors. Based
on our internal estimates, we believe we hold a leading position in the majority of those countries. We
believe our broad geographic footprint combined with strong local market positions is a competitive
advantage which continues to enhance our ability to serve our existing clients with a complete service
offering across diverse markets and the full CMS value chain and also to expand client relationships.

_Leading position in the European financial institutions segment_

Based on our internal estimates, we believe that we hold one of the leading positions among credit
management providers with respect to financial institutions clients in Europe. We believe that the
financial institutions segment in Europe continues to represent one of the most attractive segments of
the credit management market. Financial institutions are the largest originator of debt and, based on
data from the EBA, European bank NPL stock amounted to approximately SEK 7 trillion (€0.7 trillion
equivalent) as of March 31, 2019. The financial institutions segment also offers attractive economics
with long durations and high earnings visibility. We have a long track record of collecting on NPLs and
have built long-term relationships with European financial institutions. During the three years ended
December 31, 2018, we acquired NPLs with a total collectible value on portfolio investments of SEK
443,069 million (€44,312 million equivalent) from European financial institutions. For the year ended
December 31, 2018, 79% of revenue in our Portfolio Investments service line was generated by
portfolios acquired from financial institutions. In addition, we have a strong track record in entering into

2


-----

strategic partnerships with financial institutions, including long-term servicing contracts and often the
carve-out of operational servicing platforms.

_Leading position in the European trade segment for CMS and portfolio investments_

Based on our internal estimates, we believe that we hold one of the leading positions among credit
management providers in providing servicing and acquisition of overdue trade receivables (“OTR”) to
non-financial services companies in Europe. The OTR segment complements the financial institutions
segment as it offers a relatively stable and high volume of stock with short duration. In many of the
markets in which we operate, we believe OTR flow will remain at high levels in the short-term, driven
by increased household spending, a structural shift towards a higher proportion of invoice payments
and increased outsourcing of CMS operations.

**_Europe’s most diversified credit management company_**

_Complete service offering_

In addition to having the widest European geographic footprint, we believe that we have the European
market’s broadest service offerings across the CMS value chain, including financial services, enabling
us to operate as a “one-stop shop” for our clients. Our predominant activities are in CMS and portfolio
investments. Additionally, within our CMS service line, we offer value-added services before loans and
receivables become overdue, including information, invoice and payment services, which are an
important source of origination for our CMS and portfolio investment businesses and for data collection.
Our broad product and service offering is complemented by our ability to offer flexible solutions to our
clients, including by leveraging our market-leading capabilities in the carving-out of financial institutions’
in-house collection units, co-investment structures and the provision of RES.

_Ability to acquire and service several types of loans_

Historically, we have focused on unsecured consumer debt originated by financial institutions and OTRs
originated by the non-financial sector. In recent years, we have also increased our activities in the
secured consumer debt market segment, including through key acquisitions such as the June 2016
acquisition of Aktua Soluciones Financieras Holdings, S.L. and its subsidiaries (“Aktua”), one of the
leading credit management companies in the secured NPL segment in Spain, further strengthening our
RES capabilities and the purchase of a real estate portfolio from Ibercaja in December 2018. We now
work with secured assets in 10 countries, further demonstrating our capabilities across diverse types of
loans.

**_Integrated client offering spanning both CMS and Portfolio Investments service lines_**

_Data analytics_

Our broad service offering allows us to collect data through the CMS value chain and extract data
synergies to continuously strengthen our data analytics capabilities. We consider data analytics and
business intelligence to be important in driving optimized collection strategies and accurately and
competitively pricing the portfolios for which we bid. We estimate that we have collected depersonalized
data on over 296 million claims across both debt collection, sourced from within our CMS service line,
and portfolio investments, sourced from within our Portfolio Investments service line. We also estimate
that we have a data warehouse consisting of over 10.3 billion events, such as payments and actions
taken, associated with the claims on which we have collected depersonalized data.

_Operational synergies_

The combined scale we achieve through the breadth of our service offering as well as our pan-European
footprint provides us with economies of skill and scale. Given the scalable nature of our business model,
operational synergies are important drivers of increased operational efficiency. In the twelve months
ended June 30, 2019, our EBITDA margin increased to 38% compared to 37% for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2018.

-----

_Financial complementarity_

With our integrated and balanced business model we can solve for our clients’ needs and offer a total
solution across the CMS value chain. Additionally we benefit from the financial complementarity
between our two service lines, whereby capital-light earnings from the CMS service line (SEK 2,481
million (€237 million equivalent) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019) generate cash which can
be utilized for portfolio investments and deleveraging.

**_Diversified origination platform_**

_Pan-European presence, multi-sector and transaction structure capabilities_

Our pan-European presence, with operations in 24 European countries, enables us to efficiently allocate
capital to opportunities with the best risk/reward profiles. We have capabilities with respect to financial
institutions as well as across multiple trade sectors, including utilities, telecommunications and retail,
which allows flexible capital deployment for portfolio investments and enhances our ability to identify
and take advantage of trends in various sectors in the CMS service line. Furthermore, we benefit from
our successful experience in executing co-investments which provides us with the resources to swiftly
capitalize on market opportunities, allowing us to acquire larger and more mixed portfolios. Additionally
our centrally organized Alternative Asset Group (“AAG”), which focuses on secured and sizeable B2B
transactions, gives us the capacity and capability to address large, complex and sensitive transactions,
as well as centrally coordinate and attract co-investors and secure additional sources of funding, as
demonstrated by our strategic partnership with Banca Intesa Sanpaolo (“Intesa Sanpaolo”) and the
acquisition of the REO portfolio from Ibercaja. In addition to generating Portfolio Investments revenues,
these transactions also act as growth accelerators of our CMS service line, through the subsequent
contracts to service the acquired portfolios, while requiring a lower level of upfront capital investment.
Our extensive pan-European presence also allows us to provide CMS services to, and increase our
share of wallet with, clients who have cross-border and across service activities across service lines.

_Long-term relationships with our CMS clients_

We have an impressive track record of maintaining long-term relationships with our largest clients and
we have also historically achieved high levels of repeat purchases from existing customers, which we
believe evidences the strength of our product and service offerings. Of our 20 largest clients in the CMS
service line, 17 have had a relationship with us lasting more than 10 years, of which 8 have had a
relationship of more than 15 years and the relationship with our largest client extends beyond 25 years.

_Large number of repeat and small purchases_

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, we purchased SEK 1,666 million (€160 million equivalent)
of loans and other overdue receivables under forward flow contracts, providing visibility on new
business origination. Additionally, over the same period, we made SEK 518 million (€49 million
equivalent) of smaller purchases of portfolios of less than SEK 21 million (€2 million equivalent) in size.
As of June 30, 2019, our average portfolio investment claim size was SEK 15,200 (€1,400 equivalent).

_CMS enables a competitive tendering process benefitting the portfolio investment part of our business_

When bidding for portfolios from our existing CMS clients, we are able to leverage our existing business
relationship, accurately and competitively price portfolios that we find attractive and offer an attractive
value proposition to clients that is informed by our knowledge of, and provision of other services to, the
specific client.

_Significant supply of NPLs in the market_

Based on data from the EBA, European bank NPL stock amounted to approximately SEK 7 trillion (€0.7
trillion equivalent) as of March 31, 2019, representing more than 1.5 times the 2007 levels. We expect
continued regular and pro-active sales by banks as they manage a broad range of new rules and
regulations such as, for example, Basel IV, IFRS 9 and ECB calendar provisioning. As a result, we
anticipate an increase in debt sales as a proportion of NPL stock. Ultimately, the evolution of NPL stock
depends on the macroeconomic situations of the countries in question. For example, in a downturn, we
would expect an increase in the generation of new NPLs. However, in a favorable macroeconomic

4


-----

environment, NPL generation is more muted, as evidenced by NPL levels for the last few years. See
“Industry Overview—Key Drivers of the Credit Management Industry.”

**_Track record of continuous operational excellence, innovation and efficiency improvements_**

We benefit from a strong culture that is focused on innovation and operational improvement to drive
financial performance. We have historically undertaken a range of initiatives that have improved our
collection and margins and that we believe will continue to improve the performance of our business.
These include, among other things:

- _standardization:_ consolidating infrastructure among subsidiaries, aligning operational processes
and reducing the number of physical collection sites and IT and virtual collection systems;

- _data management:_ centralizing data pools and implementing data cleansing techniques and
analytical tools to support enhanced decision-making;

- _digitalization: investing in self-service consumer and client portals to facilitate timely and transparent_
communication and proactive management of credit management services;

- _automation: deploying sales-based robotics with advanced software capable of replicating human_
activities and exploring the application of artificial intelligence to operational processes; and

- _shared services:_ consolidating and near-shoring shared services and continuing to evaluate
expansion to additional service centers.

In addition, we continue to benefit from significant cost synergies associated with the merger of Intrum
Justitia AB (publ) and Lindorff completed on June 27, 2017 (the “Merger”). Our integration efforts are
delivering the desired results, with approximately 90% of the planned synergies having been
successfully implemented by June 30, 2019. See “—Our Strategy—Continue to drive profitability
_through operational excellence and realization of operational synergies.”_

**_Strong embedded risk culture_**

We benefit from well-defined and multi-layered risk management frameworks and a rigorous approach
to maintaining pricing discipline that we believe will continue to support profitability through active and
effective management of pricing, reputational and regulatory risks throughout our investment decisionmaking process. Through the breadth and depth of our experience throughout the CMS value chain we
have access to comprehensive databases of purchased and serviced debt to which we apply our data
analysis capabilities in order to take a centralized approach to forecasting and pricing. Our centralized
forecasting and pricing is further supported by specialist local input, ensuring that the pricing of each
portfolio benefits from a strong cross-organizational evaluation. Our data capabilities also facilitate more
efficient debt collection strategies through data analytics and cross-learning. In addition, our three-tiered
risk management approach helps ensure that our sophisticated pricing information is used in an
investment decision-making context that is grounded in compliance and the maintenance of strong
internal controls. Our focus on risk management and compliance is incorporated into our structure at
the local level, which is our first line of defense, and up through both the internal and independent
external risk control and auditing functions that are carried out at our executive and board levels. All of
our portfolio acquisitions are subject to a standardized process involving independent review by our risk
function and investment authority, with the largest transactions requiring approval by our Board of
Directors.

We believe that our focus on pricing discipline and risk management has historically enabled us to
consistently outperform our forecasted collections. From January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2019, on a
quarterly basis we collected 105 – 115% of our cash flow forecasts.

**_Resilient financial performance with strong cash generation_**

_Track record of stable revenue growth and expanding margins_

We have a track record of delivering revenue growth and EBITDA margin expansion. For example,
during the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, our net revenue grew at 11% and our EBITDA margin
increased from 37% in the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 to 38% in the twelve months ended

5


-----

June 30, 2019. We believe there is potential for further top-line growth based on favorable market
dynamics and our capital deployment flexibility. Additionally, we believe our EBITDA margin will
continue to be positively impacted by our operating leverage, ongoing cost savings initiatives and
realization of synergies associated with the Merger.

_Stable cash flows and a unique dataset from the capital light CMS service line_

Our CMS services, which require relatively limited investment, generate stable cash flows and are
supported by long-term client relationships. As of June 30, 2019, we manage third-party debt with a
combined total collectible value on third-party debt of SEK 920,313 million (€87,187 million equivalent).

Furthermore, we benefit from several long-term servicing contracts related to carve-out transactions
with financial institutions. We also benefit from system integration with clients associated with the
provision of our services, making it unattractive from the client perspective to switch credit management
companies. Overall, we tend to experience strong client loyalty and limited attrition.

_Significant cash flows embedded in investment portfolios_

As of June 30, 2019, our estimated remaining collections (“ERC”) was SEK 60,896 million (€5,786
million equivalent). We have made significant portfolio investments over the past two years. For the
years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we acquired portfolios for SEK 11,854 million and SEK
7,223 million, respectively. We expect these investments to generate significant cash flows over the
coming years. We have a long track record of outperforming our initial collection forecasts during the
initial forecast period up to 15 years as well as a track record of extending collection periods beyond 15
years.

_Strong cash generation with efficient conversion of profit into cash flow_

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, we used SEK 499 million and SEK 251 million,
respectively (€48 million and €25 million equivalent, respectively), representing 5% and 3%),
respectively, of our Cash EBITDA on capital expenditures other than capital expenditures related to
portfolio investments and M&A activities. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, our
total portfolio investments were SEK 10,809 million and SEK 7,772 million, respectively (€1,035 million
and €784 million equivalent respectively). For additional information on our cash conversion rates, see
“Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and
_capital resources.”_

**_Proven management team with a clear strategic agenda_**

_Strong leadership of experienced senior management supported by specialist teams in central_
_functions and local markets_

We are managed by a strong executive team comprising individuals with many years of relevant
experience and providing leadership across all functional areas of the business. Our CEO, Mikael
Ericson, was formerly Head of International Banking at Danske Bank A/S, one of the leading banks in
the Nordic region, and CEO of Carnegie Investment Bank AB. Our CFO, Anders Engdahl, is an
experienced financial professional who has held senior positions at Intrum, Lindorff and Morgan
Stanley. At Morgan Stanley, Anders held the position of Managing Director and Head of Nordic Financial
Institutions investment banking. Anders possesses a strong background in the credit management
services sector, having joined Lindorff in 2014 as EVP of Debt Purchasing. Anders held the same role
at Intrum subsequent to the Merger. Our executive team is supported by a skilled team of managers
operating our central functions and assisting in strategy execution at the group level. In addition, our
regional and country managers bring to bear significant industry expertise and local input to drive
execution of our strategic agenda.

**Our Strategy**

**_Be the leading CMS company driving operational excellence_**

We are the largest and most diversified credit management company in Europe with one of the leading
positions in the majority of countries in which we operate, based on internal estimates, and the ability
to serve clients across the full CMS value chain and across various asset classes. We aim to continue

6


-----

to build scale, lead in all markets where we operate, create value for clients, and achieve operational
excellence in everything we do.

**_Continue to operate an integrated business model providing a complete service offering_**

We believe that we continue to be well-positioned for growth and continue to offer complete credit
management solutions for our clients across asset classes and sectors based on our integrated and
balanced business model. Key features of our growth strategy include:

- _Full client offering providing integrated CMS and financial services solutions. We offer our clients_
both CMS and financial services solutions, providing them with the full scope of services across the
CMS value chain. We believe that our full service offering, geographic footprint and scale are highly
attractive to existing and potential clients. For instance, our recent entry into a partnership with
Intesa Sanpaolo includes entering into a long-term CMS contract as well as our acquisition, through
a joint venture, of an NPL portfolio from Intesa Sanpaolo. See “Business—Material contracts,
_acquisitions and mergers—Banca Intesa Sanpaolo.” The transaction demonstrates the breadth of_
our capabilities and the attractiveness of our service offering to our clients. Furthermore, we see
opportunities to increase our share of wallet with existing CMS clients by providing services to them
throughout their geographic footprint and service needs. Additionally, our CMS business line
provides us with deep insight into the portfolios of our clients and enables us to competitively price
portfolios.

- _Continued focus on acquisitions of unsecured NPL and expansion of consumer (“B2C”) debt,_
_secured debt and real estate services: Unsecured consumer NPL sales volumes have remained_
high as banks increasingly prefer to sell their debt to trusted debt collection agencies in order to
clean up their balance sheets and enable them to focus on their core business. We expect a
continued high level of NPL sales, given factors such as the growth in consumer lending and
European Central Banks (“ECB”) regulation of NPLs. We expect to continue to deploy capital within
the unsecured NPL space in order to gain scale in markets where we are not a leader and, to a
lesser extent, to opportunistically enter new segments. We expect to continue to partner with banks
on bilaterally agreed large, complex and sensitive transactions, of which our Intesa Sanpaolo
partnership is a recent example. Additionally, secured NPL transactions have increased in recent
years and represent a large portion of the NPL market. Our acquisition of Aktua, one of the leading
credit management companies in the secured NPL segment in Spain, in June 2016 significantly
strengthened our secured consumer capabilities and added RES capabilities to our service offering.
In December 2018, we reached an agreement with Ibercaja to acquire 6,400 properties in Spain
via a joint venture and in April 2019 we completed the acquisition of Solvia, which offers real estate
management services in the Spanish market, from Banco Sabadell, both of which further build out
our RES capabilities. See “Business—Material contracts, acquisitions and mergers—Solvia
Servicios Immobiliaros.” We expect to continue our systematic expansion in the secured NPL and
RES segment through greenfield operations and opportunistic acquisitions. We see growth
potential from leveraging and exporting the capabilities we have developed in secured and RES
markets across many of the geographies in which we operate.

- _Co-investments: In our portfolio investments segment, we see a pipeline in terms of the number_
and the size of investment opportunities available, which may outpace our on-balance sheet
investment appetite. We consider flexible capital deployment initiatives, such as co-investment
structures, which provide us with the ability to acquire larger, mixed portfolios due to risk sharing
with co-investment partners. Co-investments also increase the breadth of our origination platform
by leveraging the network of our co-investment partners. These transactions, in addition to
generating revenues from portfolio investments, also act as growth accelerators of third-party debt
collection while requiring a lower level of upfront capital investment.

- _Geographic expansion: We have a strong track record of expansion into new markets and_
expanding our presence within existing markets. We have established operations in 25 countries,
including through partnerships and strategic transactions such as carve-outs and bolt-on
acquisitions. For example, in December 2018 we entered into a strategic partnership with Intesa
Sanpaolo, establishing us as a leading player in late payments in Italy, one of Europe’s most
attractive markets, and in June 2019 we announced we had entered into an agreement to acquire
an 80% stake in Piraeus’ Recovery Banking Unit platform in Greece (“Piraeus Partnership”).
Based on EBA data, our geographic footprint covers 98% of European NPLs, as of March 31, 2019.

7


-----

Going forward, we will continue to proactively evaluate opportunities to expand in existing markets
where we currently do not hold leading positions and, to a lesser extent, opportunistically enter new
markets, for example through carve-outs and targeted acquisitions. When entering new markets,
our strategy is typically based on a cautious first entry: we start small and increase our investments
as our insight and experience in a particular market increases. Moreover, we often strengthen our
local knowledge and databases through business acquisitions and/or carve-out transactions (as we
have previously done in the United Kingdom, Spain, Poland and Italy). For example, one method
we employ to enter a new market involves acquiring a company with existing debt servicing
capabilities and data, operating the company to develop further knowledge and data capabilities
and then leveraging this data and market knowledge to price and purchase debt in the newly
entered market.

**_Continue to drive profitability through operational excellence and the realization of operational_**
**_synergies_**

We have a long history of commitment to operational excellence and a track record of improving our
margins. We have identified several initiatives to further drive efficiency improvements and increase our
profitability going forward, including:

- _Operational integration and portfolio management: We have identified four key operational levers_
which we continue to execute on: utilization of shared services and scale opportunities, focus on IT
effectiveness and efficiency, best-in-class sourcing and procurement and continuing to deploy best
practices across our operations to maximize synergy opportunities. We seek to leverage scale and
skills advantages and experience in data management, analytics and digitalization to drive
collection performance across our CMS and Portfolio Investments service lines. We continue to see
strong value potential in focusing on active portfolio management.

- _Focus on pricing discipline, risk management and compliance: As a result of strict pricing discipline,_
institutionalized investment processes and operational improvements, from January 1, 2017
through June 30, 2019, on a quarterly basis we have collected 105 - 115% of our cash flow
forecasts. We intend to continue demonstrating a high level of underwriting discipline in order to
maintain forecasting accuracy and to ensure that we only acquire portfolios that meet our
investment return criteria. In addition, we seek to maintain our competitive advantage through
continued early adoption of regulation and best-in-class compliance and risk management
procedures.

- _Realize operational synergies: As of June 30, 2019, we have successfully realized 90% of the SEK_
680 million of cost savings and synergies we expect to achieve as a result of the Merger. Our
management estimates that we will achieve the remaining synergies by the end of 2019.
Implementation costs in relation to the remaining cost synergies are expected to be SEK 90 million
(€9 million equivalent). Cost savings realized to date primarily relate to optimization of operations
centers, consolidation of administrative and support functions, harmonization of IT systems and
application development/maintenance, and increased scale in procurement. We have also
capitalized on certain revenue synergies associated with the Merger from the combination of
business intelligence operations and data sets, cross-selling of complementary offerings to existing
clients, improved cross-border coverage of international clients and transfer of best practices.

**_Commitment to highest ethical standards and fair collection practices_**

We are dependent upon relationships characterized by trust with clients, the relevant authorities and
society as a whole. In order to achieve the necessary level of trust, we must act with professionalism,
expertise and high ethical standards at all levels of our operations. Our internal standards are applicable
to all employees. These standards mandate that all employees are expected to always work within the
law, have sound moral principles and behave in an upstanding and sincere way. We have implemented
a centrally coordinated compliance monitoring program which evaluates and assesses compliance with
legal, regulatory and industry best practices as well as our internal standards. The continued
commitment to the highest ethical and fair collection practices is paramount to our ability to be the
leading credit management company in Europe.

-----

**_Commitment to financial targets_**

In the past, we have publicly committed to achieving certain financial targets, including with respect to
leverage, earnings per share, portfolio return on investments and dividend policy. In particular, by the
end of 2020, we aim to achieve the following financial targets:

- Net Debt/Cash EBITDA: 2.5 - 3.5x

- EPS: SEK 35

- Portfolio ROI: >13%

- Dividend: >50% pay-out ratio on average over time, based on net earnings after tax over time.

These financial targets have been prepared and verified in good faith by our management based on
our forecasted business plan, which are subject to a number of assumptions, and have not been audited
or reviewed by our independent auditors or any other person. As these financial targets are forecasts
and dependent on future performance, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on them.
Where our financial targets are expressed as a range, there can be no assurance as to where within
such range our actual results of operations will in fact be.

In preparing financial targets, we have in general assumed that there will be no material changes in
existing political, legal, fiscal, market or economic conditions or in applicable legislation, regulations or
rules (including, but not limited to, accounting policies and accounting treatments), which, individually
or in the aggregate, would be material to our results of operations and that we will not become party to
any litigation or administrative proceeding of which we are currently unaware that might have a material
impact on our results of operations. Such assumptions may prove to be incorrect, we may decide to
alter our short- or medium-term priorities or strategic plan or we may decide to deviate from our financial
targets at any time, for example if compelling business or investment opportunities arise. Other factors
that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such targets include, but are not limited to,
those described under “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.”

**The Transactions**

The “Transactions,” as used herein, shall comprise the following: (i) the Offering; (ii) the redemption
(the “Redemption”) of €750 million aggregate principal amount of the Issuer’s €1,500 million aggregate
principal amount of 2.750% senior notes due 2022 (the “June 2017 Fixed Rate Euro 2022 Notes”)
outstanding as of June 30, 2019 issued under the indenture dated June 26, 2017 (the “June 2017
**Notes Indenture”) among,** _inter alios, the Issuer, as issuer, and Citibank, N.A., London Branch, as_
trustee; (iii) the payment of fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing and (iv) using the net
proceeds of the Offering in excess of amounts used in connection with the foregoing to repay drawings
under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Description of Other

**Recent developments**

**_July 2019 Transactions_**

On July 31, 2019, we issued €800 million of 3.500% senior notes due 2026 (the “July 2019 Notes”)
under the indenture dated July 31, 2019 among, inter alios, the Issuer, as issuer, and Citibank, N.A.,
London Branch, as trustee (the “July 2019 Notes Indenture” and, together with the June 2017 Notes

**_2019 MTN Transactions_**

In June 2019 we published, and the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority approved, an updated
prospectus for the Intrum Existing MTN Program, enabling us to issue bonds under a note programme
of up to SEK 5,000 million. As of June 30, 2019, we had an aggregate outstanding amount of SEK
1,000 million of Intrum Existing MTNs due 2020 that were issued on July 6, 2018. On July 3, 2019, we
completed an issuance of SEK 2,000 million of Intrum Existing MTNs due 2023, the proceeds of which
were used to repay drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility (the “July 2019 MTN Transactions”).
On August 22, 2019, we completed an additional issuance of SEK 900 million of Intrum Existing MTNs
due 2023, the proceeds of which were used to repay drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility (the
“August 2019 MTN Transactions” and, together with the July 2019 MTN Transactions, the “2019 MTN
**Transactions”).** The SEK 2,900 million of Intrum Existing MTNs due 2023 issued after June 30, 2019
are not reflected on our balance sheet as of June 30, 2019. As of June 30, 2019, after giving effect to
the 2019 MTN Transactions, we have an aggregate outstanding amount of Intrum Existing MTNs of
SEK 3,900 million.

**_Backstop Revolving Credit Facility_**

On July 18, 2019, we entered into a multicurrency revolving credit facility agreement with certain lenders
in order to provide a backstop facility for the Intrum Existing Commercial Paper Program and for general
corporate purposes. The total commitments under the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement,
including swingline commitments, are SEK 2,000 million (€190 million equivalent). It is a condition of
utilization of the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility commitments that at least 95% of the commitments
under the Revolving Credit Facility have been utilized.

**_Continued efficiency improvements program_**

As part of our efforts to further increase our operational efficiency, and building on the largely completed
merger synergies from the Merger, we are targeting €60 million in further efficiency improvements in
our bottom-line earnings in 2020 (on a run-rate basis). This will include activities such as fully integrating
Solvia into our existing operations and carefully prioritizing key projects within IT to ensure we benefit
from the size and scale of our organization. The costs to realize the program efficiency improvements
are anticipated to be equivalent to one year’s benefit.

Such run-rate operational efficiency improvement estimates (as well as costs related to implementing
such measures) are based on a number of assumptions made in reliance on the information available
to us and management’s judgments based on such information. The assumptions used in estimating
such operational efficiency improvements and related costs are inherently uncertain and are subject to
a variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those contained in any operational benefit estimates. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks related to our industry and business—Anticipated synergies from the Merger or_
_operational efficiency improvements from continued efficiency improvements programs may not_
_materialize.”_

_Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries; Future Guarantors”, the Issuer will not_
have any obligation to cause any of its subsidiaries to guarantee the Notes in the future. There can be no assurance that
the Notes will benefit from guarantees from any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries in the future. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related
_to the Notes—The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities and preference shares (if any) of our subsidiaries_
_that do not guarantee the Notes.”_

(6) As of June 30, 2019, as adjusted for the 2019 MTN Transactions, the Issuer had an aggregate amount of SEK 3,900 million
(€361 million equivalent) outstanding under the Intrum Existing MTN Program, including SEK 1,000 million of Intrum Existing
MTNs that will mature on July 6, 2020 and SEK 2,900 million of Intrum Existing MTNs that will mature on July 3, 2023. The
Intrum Existing MTNs will rank equally in right of payment with the Notes. See “Summary—Recent developments—2019
_MTN Transactions” and “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intrum Existing MTNs.”_

(7) As of June 30, 2019, the Issuer had €160 million (SEK 1,687 million equivalent) outstanding under the Intrum Existing Private
Placement Notes. The Intrum Existing Private Placement Notes will rank equally in right of payment with the Notes. Pursuant
to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intrum Existing Private Placement Notes are secured by the property
securing the Revolving Credit Facility and that will secure the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility. Accordingly, the Notes will
be effectively subordinated to indebtedness of the Issuer incurred under the Intrum Existing Private Placement Notes to the
extent of the value of property securing the Intrum Existing Private Placement Notes. See “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Intrum Existing Private Placement Notes.”_

(8) As of June 30, 2019, the Issuer had SEK 2,480 million (€235 million equivalent) outstanding under the Intrum Existing
Commercial Paper Program. The Intrum Existing Commercial Paper Program will rank equally in right of payment with the
Notes. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intrum Existing Commercial Paper Program.”

(9) The Issuer is a borrower under the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. The terms of the Backstop Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement require that the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility will be guaranteed by subsidiaries
of the Issuer which, together with the Issuer, represent not less than 80% of the consolidated EBITDA and consolidated
gross assets of the Issuer and its subsidiaries (in each case calculated in accordance with the Backstop Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement). Accordingly, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to these subsidiaries’ guarantees under the
Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and effectively subordinated to indebtedness of the Issuer incurred under the
Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to the extent of the value of property securing the Backstop Revolving Credit
Facility. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement” and “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

13


-----

_on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries; Future_
_Guarantors”, the Issuer will not have any obligation to cause any_
of its subsidiaries to guarantee the Notes in the future. There can
be no assurance that the Notes will benefit from guarantees from

_subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes.”_

**Optional Redemption ..................... At any time and from time to time on or after September 15, 2022,**
the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes at the redemption

**Additional Amounts ....................... Any payments made by the Issuer with respect to the Notes will**
be made without withholding or deduction for taxes in any taxing
jurisdiction unless required by law. If we are required by law to
withhold or deduct for taxes of a relevant tax jurisdiction with
respect to a payment to the holders of the Notes, we will pay the
additional amounts necessary so that the net amount received by
the holders of the Notes after the withholding is not less than the
amount that they would have received in the absence of the
withholding, subject to certain exceptions. See “Description of the
_Notes—Withholding Taxes.”_

**SUMMARY HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA**

_The following section presents summary historical consolidated financial data of the Issuer as of the_
_dates and for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the sections entitled “Use of_
Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Selected Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data,” “Management
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” _as well as the Issuer’s_
_Financial Statements._

_In November 2017, in connection with the Divestment, the Issuer agreed to divest certain subsidiaries_
_to a company in the Lowell Group. The Divestment completed on March 20, 2018. In the income_
_statement for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the six and twelve months ended_
_June 30, 2018, the subsidiaries being divested in accordance with the above have been reported as_
_discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued_
_Operations. In the balance sheet as of December 31, 2017, these subsidiaries are reported as assets_
_and liabilities in operations held for sale. For further information, see note 39 in the Issuer’s audited_
_financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 included elsewhere_
_in this Offering Memorandum_

_We adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers from January 1, 2018 and IFRS 16_
_Leases from January 1, 2019. The Issuer’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the_
_year ended December 31, 2017 and unaudited financial statements as of and for the twelve months_
_ended June 30, 2018 have not been restated to reflect the retrospective adoption of IFRS 15. Neither_
_the Issuer’s Audited Financial Statements nor the Issuer’s unaudited financial statements as of and for_
_the six and twelve months ended June 30, 2018 and the Issuer’s unaudited financial statements as of_
_and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 have been restated to reflect the retrospective adoption_
_of IFRS 16. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information”, “Management Discussion and_
Analysis of Financial Condition” and note 1 to the Issuer’s audited financial statements as of and for the
_year ended December 31, 2018 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum for additional_
_information regarding our adoption of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16._

_This section includes certain LTM Information for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018._
_This LTM Information has been calculated by adding the Issuer’s historical results for the six months_
_ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, to the Issuer’s historical results for the year ended_
_December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and subtracting the Issuer’s historical results for the six_
_months ended June, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The LTM Information has been prepared solely for_
_the purposes of this Offering Memorandum, is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial_
_reporting, has not been audited or reviewed and does not reflect the application of IFRS 15 or IFRS 16_
_over the entire period. It is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily representative of the_
_Issuer’s results of operations for any future period or its financial condition at any future date._

_In this section we also present selected unaudited pro forma financial information and other data that_
_has been prepared based on the Issuer’s Financial Statements and assumptions described herein. The_
_selected unaudited pro forma financial information has been included to describe a hypothetical_
_situation and has been prepared for illustrative purposes only. The selected unaudited pro forma_
_financial information does not include all of the information required for financial statements under IFRS._
_Future results may vary significantly from the results reflected because of various factors, including_
_those discussed in “Risk Factors.”_

_We present below certain non-IFRS financial measures such as EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Cash_
_EBITDA and Pro Forma Cash EBITDA because we believe they are important supplementary measures_
_and that they are widely used by investors comparing performance between companies. Since not all_
_companies compute these non-IFRS financial measures in the same way, the manner in which our_
_management has chosen to compute the non-IFRS financial measures presented herein may not be_
_comparable with similarly defined terms used by other companies. These measures are not measures_
_of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of_
_our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance_
_with IFRS, and they may not accurately reflect our performance, liquidity or our ability to incur or service_
_debt._

_In this section, we also present various key operating metrics. We believe that these metrics are helpful_
_in understanding our performance from period to period and facilitate comparison with our peers. These_

(i) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, SEK 10.4471 to €1.00, which represents the average of the monthly
exchange rates for the twelve month period ended June 30, 2019, published by Sveriges Riksbank; (ii) for the twelve months

(3) We define EBITDA as profit and loss for the period before taxes, net financial items, discontinued operations and
depreciation on fixed assets. EBITDA margin represents EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. We define Cash EBITDA as
EBITDA before amortization and revaluation of portfolio investments. We define Pro Forma Cash EBITDA as Cash EBITDA
further adjusted for the impact of (i) for certain non-recurring items that are not included in our normally recurring operations
and that are not expected to recur on a regular basis, including costs associated with implementing synergy programs in
connection with the Merger, (ii) for participations in associated companies and joint ventures excluding dividend and (iii) the
pro forma effect of significant acquisitions made during the period under review.
We present EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Cash EBITDA and Pro Forma Cash EBITDA because we consider them to be
important supplemental measures of the Issuer’s performance and ability to service its debt, and we believe these measures
and measures similar to these are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the
evaluation of companies in our industry. You are encouraged to evaluate these presentations and adjustments and the
reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Pro Forma Cash EBITDA, you should be
aware that we may incur expenses that are the same or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation in the future,
and our presentation of Pro Forma Cash EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be
unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Cash EBITDA and Pro Forma Cash EBITDA are
not specifically defined under, or presented in accordance with, IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles
and you should not consider them as an alternative to profit or loss for the period or any other performance measures derived
in accordance with IFRS. EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Cash EBITDA and _Pro Forma_ Cash EBITDA have limitations as
analytical tools, and you should not consider any of these measures in isolation, or as a substitute for profit or loss for the
period or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS. For a description of the limitations of EBITDA,
EBITDA Margin, Cash EBITDA and Pro Forma Cash EBITDA as financial measures, see “Presentation of Financial and
_Other Information— Non-IFRS Financial Measures.”_

our Portuguese operations were reported in the “Western and Southern Europe” region. For all periods in the above table
other than the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, amounts have been reflected based on our new reporting convention
for geographic splits such that our Portuguese operations are included in the “Iberian Peninsula and Latin America” region.
Such amounts are based on the geographic splits in the notes to our financial statements (including revised comparative
period amounts taking into account the above change). For the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, total revenue from
external clients by geographical region for each component period is not available on the basis of the new reporting
convention. As a result, for the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 in the table above, “Western and Southern Europe”
includes revenue from Portugal and “Iberian Peninsula and Latin America” does not include revenue from Portugal and as
such are not directly comparable to the other periods presented.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information in this_
_Offering Memorandum, you should carefully consider the following risk factors before purchasing the_
_Notes. The occurrence of any of the events discussed below could materially adversely affect our_
_business, financial condition and results of operations. The risks described below are not the only ones_
_we believe we are exposed to. Additional risks that are not currently known to us, or that we currently,_
_based on our regular risk assessment, consider to be immaterial, could significantly impair our business_
_activities and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of_
_operations. If any one of these events occurs, the trading price of the Notes could decline and we may_
_not be able to pay interest or principal on the Notes when due and you could lose all or part of your_
_investment. The order in which these risks are presented is not intended to provide an indication of the_
_likelihood of their occurrence or of their severity or significance._

_This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that are based on assumptions_
_and estimates and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from_
_those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including, but not_
_limited to, the risks described below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

**Risks related to our industry and business**

**_The economic conditions in the markets in which we operate affect our business._**

We are exposed to the economic, market and fiscal conditions in the markets in which we operate and
any positive or negative developments regarding these conditions. Should any such negative
developments occur, we may not be able to perform debt collection at levels consistent with our historic
levels due to the inability of customers to make payments, at the same levels or at all, as was the case
during the 2008-2010 economic downturn. Adverse economic conditions may also reduce the
propensity of debt originators to sell overdue receivables as sale prices may be unfavorable during such
periods. Furthermore, a material and adverse economic downturn could result in increased
unemployment rates or materially impact interest rates and the availability of credit resulting in
decreased demand for our payment services. Each of these developments could have a negative effect
on our financial results. In addition, should the level of inflation increase, the real-term carrying value of
our portfolio investments may decrease.

There can be no assurances that economic conditions will improve in the markets in which we operate
or that the net effect of any change in economic conditions will be positive. An improvement in the
economic conditions in the markets in which we operate could impact our business and performance in
various ways, including reducing the number of attractive portfolio opportunities that are available for
purchase or increasing the competitiveness of the pricing for portfolios that we purchase and debt
collection services that we offer. There can be no assurances that our business and results of operations
will develop positively in an improved economic environment. Conversely, while adverse economic
conditions and increased levels of unemployment may lead to higher default rates on claims, which in
turn may increase the stock of portfolios available for us to purchase and may increase the amount of
loans and other overdue receivables possessed by our debt collection clients, there can be no
assurances that such increases in the amount of debt available to purchase and service will
compensate for the adverse effects that an economic downturn may otherwise have on our business,
results of operations or financial condition. Accordingly, any of these developments could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We are active in competitive markets and may be unable to continue to successfully compete_**
**_with businesses that may offer more attractive prices, benefit from less expensive funding, have_**
**_greater funding resources or pursue lower return requirements than us._**

The European credit management industry is fragmented and consists of several thousand companies
with varying profiles. We face competition from new and existing debt collection providers, other
purchasers of portfolios of overdue loans and other overdue receivables (including financial investors)
and debt originators that manage their own portfolios rather than outsourcing or selling them. This
competition includes, but is not limited to, competition on the basis of price. New market entrants and
existing competitors may offer more attractive pricing levels, both for debt collection contracts and for
debt portfolio purchases, and accept lower returns in order to gain or increase market share. There can

27


-----

be no assurances that this price competition will not result in us paying higher prices for portfolios that
we purchase or charging less for our debt collection or other payment services, each of which could
decrease our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or
financial condition.

We face bidding competition in our acquisition of debt portfolios. We believe that successful bids are
awarded based on price as well as a range of other factors, including service, compliance, reputation
and relationships with the sellers of debt portfolios. Some of our current and potential competitors may
have more effective pricing and collection models, greater adaptability to changing market needs or
more established relationships in our industry and geographic markets than we do. Moreover, our
competitors may elect to pay prices for debt portfolios that we determine are not economically
sustainable and, in that event, our volume of debt portfolio purchases may be diminished. There can
be no assurances that our existing or potential sources of debt portfolios will continue to sell their
portfolios at historic levels or at all or that we will continue to offer competitive bids for debt portfolios.

We experience competition from financial investors with respect to purchases of debt portfolios. Some
of our current and potential competitors, including financial investors, may have greater access to
financial resources to undertake portfolio investments and may have less expensive funding or lower
return requirements than we have. Additionally, in the future we may not have the financial resources
to offer competitive bids for portfolio purchases and debt collection contracts. There can be no
assurances that we will be able to develop and expand our business or adapt to changing market needs
as well as our current or future competitors. Any of these developments could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_There may be insufficient supply of debt available for our credit management and portfolio_**
**_investments or debt available may not be appropriately priced for our needs or capacities. Any_**
**_decrease in our ability to purchase debt portfolios or provide credit management services could_**
**_materially and adversely affect our business._**

The demand for our credit optimization, payment and collection services and the availability of debt
portfolios at prices that allow us to generate profits depends on a number of factors, some of which are
outside of our control, including:

- the level of consumer spending;

- the availability of credit to consumers and consumers’ borrowing appetite, which is driven by a
number of factors including heightened regulation of the credit card and consumer lending industry,
changing credit origination strategies, tighter lending criteria introduced by consumer credit
providers, changing cultural attitudes to funding spending with borrowing and general economic
conditions, including increased interest rates;

- the level of non-performance on consumer debt portfolios and the proportion of such portfolios that
are written off by originators, which also in turn may affect the availability of credit to consumers
identified above;

- sales of debt portfolios by originators, which could be jeopardized by a change in accounting
policies or practices, the consolidation of credit card issuers or increased sophistication in internal
collection efforts;

- potential concerns that the value received for defaulted debt portfolios as a percentage of their total
collectible value may not outweigh the potential reputational risks or required management attention
associated with selling defaulted debt portfolios;

- negative publicity or a loss of trust in our industry due to our failure, or the failure of one or more of
our competitors to meet legal or regulatory obligations or otherwise;

- increased government regulation of the circumstances in which originators, especially regulated
entities, have a right to collect on debt; and

- the macroeconomic environments of the countries in which we operate.

28


-----

Originators may develop technological tools that could override the advantages we believe we currently
possess in terms of tracing technology and customer profile development. If originators choose to
perform more of their credit optimization, invoicing and debt collections internally as a result of these
data quality improvements, the demand for our credit management services and the volume of debt
portfolio sales or the quality of underlying debt sold could decrease and, consequently, we may not be
able to buy the type and quantity of receivables at prices consistent with our historical return targets. In
addition, the industry could experience a reduction in the availability of debt portfolios sold early in the
financial difficulty cycle and that have had little or no exposure to collections activity. This “fresh” debt
typically has higher collection expectations as less work has been applied to the assets to obtain
customer payments and a reduction in this type of debt portfolio could result in a corresponding increase
in the total share of more mature debt, which is typically more challenging and expensive to collect.

If we are unable to purchase portfolios from originators at appropriate prices or lack the resources to
purchase portfolios, or if one or more originators stop or decrease their demand for our credit
management services or their sales of portfolios due to one of the factors listed above or any other
factors, we could lose a source of income which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations or financial condition.

**_A significant amount of our revenue is generated from clients active within the financial services_**
**_industry._**

We derive a significant portion of our revenue from clients active within the financial services industry.
Concerns exist within the Eurozone with respect to individual macro fundamentals on a country by
country basis. Adverse economic conditions and uncertainties, including any fines or penalties on
European financial institutions and any potential resulting failures or consolidations of financial
institutions may adversely affect us by significantly reducing our client engagements. Additionally,
adverse economic conditions could lead to a reduction in the propensity of financial institutions to lend
to customers in the markets in which we operate as was the case during the global financial crisis (20082010). Adverse economic conditions may lead to a reduced supply of debt available for us to collect on
or fewer opportunities for us to enter into forward flow agreements, as well as negatively affecting
customers by reducing disposable income levels or otherwise impairing their ability to fulfil their payment
obligations. Any changes in the volume of business derived from clients active within the financial
services industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial
condition.

**_The United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union may adversely impact our business, results_**
**_of operations and financial condition._**

On June 23, 2016 the United Kingdom held a public referendum on its membership within the EU, the
result of which favored the exit of the United Kingdom from the EU (“Brexit”). The United Kingdom
triggered Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon on March 29, 2017 and was expected to officially leave the
EU on March 29, 2019. On March 21, 2019, the EU agreed to an extension until at least April 12, 2019
and on April 11, 2019 the EU again agreed to an extension until October 31, 2019. The form of the
United Kingdom’s expected withdrawal from, and future relations with, the EU is highly uncertain.

If the United Kingdom and the EU are unable to negotiate acceptable withdrawal terms or if other EU
member states pursue withdrawal, barrier-free access between the United Kingdom and other EU
member states or among the European economic area overall could be diminished or eliminated.
Depending on the final terms of Brexit, the United Kingdom could lose access to the single European
Market, which could result, among other things, in the disruption of free movement of goods, services
and people between the United Kingdom and the EU, undermine bilateral cooperation in key geographic
areas and significantly disrupt trade between the United Kingdom and the EU or other nations as the
United Kingdom pursues independent trade relations.

The exit of the United Kingdom or any other member state from the EU, or the departure from the euro
by one or more Eurozone countries, or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the
euro entirely, could lead to a reduction in market confidence and a weakening of European financial
institutions. A deterioration in political and economic conditions could result in increased unemployment
rates, increased short- and long-term interest rates, consumer and commercial bankruptcy filings and
a decline in the strength of national and local economies.

29


-----

In addition, Brexit may lead to an economic down-turn in the United Kingdom and the EU generally.
Any reduction in consumers’ willingness or ability to pay their debts due to Brexit-related changes in the
economic environment of the United Kingdom or the EU could materially affect our revenue and our
ability to perform debt collection in a manner consistent with our past practice.

Any fundamental shift in the macroeconomic environment in the United Kingdom or other parts of
Europe in which we operate could adversely affect the accuracy of our predictions regarding the
expected returns from the debt portfolios we purchase and service. See”—There may be insufficient
_supply of, debt available for our credit management and portfolio investments or debt available may not_
_be appropriately priced for our needs or capacities. Any decrease in our ability to purchase debt_
_portfolios or provide credit management services could materially and adversely affect our business.”_
Lack of clarity about future United Kingdom laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines
which EU laws to replace or replicate in the event of a withdrawal, including financial laws and
regulations, data privacy and collection laws and regulations and tax and free trade agreements, may
increase the costs associated with operating in either or both the United Kingdom or other EU
jurisdictions, depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital. Additionally, any substantive
change in the regulations applicable to our United Kingdom business could jeopardize our ability to
continue to operate in a manner consistent with our past practice.

**_Errors in our collection process or other operational matters or negative attention relating to the_**
**_credit management industry in general, or to us in particular, could have a negative effect on_**
**_our business and reputation._**

Our ability to accurately collect debt and treat customers fairly is critical to our business and our
reputation. Our reputation is important to maintaining our relationships with current and potential clients,
in particular financial institutions, and regulators. The following events, among others, may have a
negative effect on our reputation and our financial results: (i) negative media publicity relating either to
us or the wider credit management industry; (ii) allegations of unethical or improper behavior by us or
third parties we use in the collection process; (iii) inability to collect debts on an accurate and timely
basis; (iv) failure to respect and treat customers fairly; (v) failures in our collection and data protection
processes; (vi) the actions of third parties that we engage in the debt collection process; (vii) IT platform,
in particular IT security, failure; or (viii) other operational issues, litigation, regulatory restrictions,
investigations, fines or enforcement actions.

The collection of debt, particularly historic debt, involves complex interpretations and calculations of
contractual terms that may vary by client and country and which may impact the calculation of
customers’ resulting payment obligations and the collection strategies we employ. There can be no
assurances that the inherent complexity of debt calculation and historical inaccuracies will not result in
any issues in the future.

We are a party to a number of co-investment arrangements related to the purchase of debt portfolios
with financial investors or other financial institutions, and we may continue to enter such arrangements
in the future. In certain cases the co-investor may retain a majority of the investment and, as a result,
control over the investment venture. We may have limited insight into and ability to control the
governance of such co-investments or joint ventures and, even where we retain control, are therefore
subject to reputational and other risks related to the actions of the co-investors or co-venture partners,
as applicable, that are beyond our control.

Any of the foregoing events could result in financial liability or reputational damage, which could, in turn,
jeopardize our relationships with our clients or our ability to establish new client relationships, have a
negative impact on a customer’s willingness to pay a debt owed to us or to our clients, diminish our
attractiveness as a counterparty or lead to increased regulations of the credit management industry.
Any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial
condition.

**_We depend on the continued willingness and ability of our clients to offer their portfolios for_**
**_sale and outsource their credit management services._**

We depend on the willingness and ability of our clients to continue to engage us to provide credit
management and financial services. Some factors that may influence the willingness and ability of our
clients to engage us to provide such services include, but are not limited to, the strength of our

30


-----

reputation, regulatory pressures our clients face and the value proposition that we offer. Our business
could be adversely affected if our clients decide to reduce or discontinue the outsourcing of their credit
optimization, invoicing and debt collection or sales of portfolios or if the actual growth of levels of
outsourcing and sales is lower than we expect. In addition, our future revenue may be limited if
companies that do not currently outsource their debt collection or sell portfolios continue to manage
their portfolios in-house. There can be no assurances that the demand for our services will increase or
remain the same and a decrease in demand for our services could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We operate in a variety of jurisdictions and must comply with applicable laws, regulations,_**
**_licenses and codes of practice across these jurisdictions. Changes to the regulatory or political_**
**_environments in which we operate may negatively affect our business._**

_General_

We are subject to regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws and regulations
regarding our listing on Nasdaq Stockholm, data protection, debt collection, debt purchasing, consumer
credits, payment services, enhanced consumer protection and anti-money laundering and terrorist
financing at the national and supranational level. See “Regulatory Overview.” As we increase our focus
on certain business areas, such as secured loans or offering credit rescheduling agreements
(installment plans), we become subject to additional regulatory requirements, including with respect to
anti-money laundering and verifying ownership of underlying assets. There can be no assurances that
our policies and procedures will prevent breaches of applicable laws and regulations or that our
investigations will identify such breaches in a timely manner or at all. Any such delay or failure could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Adverse
regulatory developments under the laws and regulations to which we are subject could expose us to a
number of risks. In addition, from time to time we identify weaknesses in our internal policies,
procedures and controls. We cannot assure you that in the future we will identify such weaknesses or,
where we do, remedy any such weaknesses in a timely manner or at all. Any such delay or failure could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

In a number of the markets in which we operate, including, in particular, the Czech Republic, Hungary,
Italy, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom, the regulation of financial undertakings is in
all material respects similar to the rules applicable for banks (including in respect of capital adequacy
requirements). As a consequence, these financial undertakings may be subject to new or amended
legislation from the EU or relevant jurisdictions applicable to banks, including new or amended capital
requirements and liquidity requirements. Such new or amended legislation and amended interpretation
could, under certain circumstances, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations or financial conditions.

Supervisory authorities in each country in which we operate may determine that we do not fully comply
with, are currently in violation of or in the past have violated applicable rules, regulations or
administrative guidelines. Any such determination could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations or financial condition.

_Non-performing loan directive_

In March 2018, the European Commission (the “EC”) proposed a comprehensive package as part of
the EU Action Plan to tackle NPLs. The EC believes one of the key areas for reducing risk in the
European banking sector is to further decrease the number of NPLs on banks’ balance sheets. The
package put forward by the EC contains policy actions in four areas: (i) increased bank supervision and
regulation, (ii) further reforms of national restructuring, insolvency and debt recovery frameworks, (iii)
developing secondary markets for distressed assets and (iv) fostering, as appropriate and necessary,
the restructuring of banks. Continued efforts by the EU to reduce the number of NPLs on the balance
sheets of banks could lead to a reduction in the number of debt portfolios available for purchase and
could increase competition for those portfolios which are available. There can be no assurance that the
impact of these regulations or others like them enacted or imposed in other jurisdictions will not impede
our ability to conduct our operations, result in further litigation or have a negative impact on our
business.

31


-----

_Data protection_

We are subject to various regulatory requirements regarding data protection in the jurisdictions in which
we operate. Such regulatory requirements differ from country to country. In the past, regulatory
authorities have imposed fines on certain of our subsidiaries for non-compliance with data protection
regulations and we cannot assure you that similar fines will not be imposed in the future. The imposition
of any such fines or any other sanctions by regulatory authorities may have negative consequences
that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
In particular, if it turns out that any business activity we conduct is non-compliant, we may be ordered
to cease such business activity until the breach is cured. Changes to data protection laws and
regulations or changes to their interpretation by data protection authorities and courts may reduce our
operational flexibility and limit our ability to collect, retain or use our customer data to price portfolios
and create efficient debt collection strategies. On April 27, 2016, the regulation on the protection of
natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data,
and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation, the “GDPR”) was adopted by
the European Parliament and the European Council. The GDPR became directly applicable in all EU
Member States on May 25, 2018, and replaced Directive 95/46/EC and existing national data protection
legislation and was also implemented in EEA countries with effect from the same date. The GDPR
significantly changed the EU/EEA data protection landscape, including strengthening of individuals’
rights, stricter requirements on companies processing personal data and stricter sanctions with
substantial administrative fines. The GDPR also offers data subjects the option to let a privacy
organization litigate on their behalf, including collecting the potential damages. The GDPR regime
imposes a substantially higher compliance burden on the credit management industry, including on our
operations. While we have put in place rules, policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the
GDPR there can be no assurance that such rules, policies and procedures will be successful in ensuring
compliance with GDPR. Any failure to comply with the GDPR could result in sanctions, penalties or
other negative consequences which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations or financial condition. In addition, we could lose a competitive advantage and our business
could be negatively affected if current governmental regulations were to change such that certain of the
information or customer data that we use becomes public, the countries where we operate introduce
measures that have the effect of facilitating the tracing of customers or allowing credit market
participants direct access to credit information before the purchase of portfolios or to prohibit us from
using customer data in the manner or to the extent currently used.

_Statutes of limitation_

In most of the countries in which we currently have local operations, we are able to extend the statutes
of limitation on historic debt claims by taking legal action, notifying the customer or otherwise
interrupting the limitation period. Some of the countries in which we operate have in recent years
changed the statutes of limitation for certain debt including by limiting the ability to extend or interrupt
the limitation period, or have discussed such changes. There can be no assurances that we would be
successful in adjusting our operations to these or other similar regulatory changes.

_Consumer protection_

The credit management industry could be subject to increased scrutiny due to local political factors and
developments, which could in turn lead to changes in laws and regulations. The area of consumer credit
has recently come under increased regulatory focus by national governments. For instance, caps on
interest rate and penalties or sanctions for defaulted loans or total cost of credit have been introduced
in several of the countries in which we operate. Such legislation may also be introduced in other
jurisdictions and such restrictions can materially affect the consumer credit market since lenders derive
a large portion of their profits from credit costs.

Stricter regulations regarding installment plans have also been or in the future may be enacted or
imposed by court ruling in countries in which we operate. For example, a March 2019 ruling by the Court
of Justice of the European Union held, in a case originating from Spain, that certain accelerated
repayment clauses of mortgages found to be unfair cannot be maintained in part, with those elements
which make it unfair are removed, where removing those elements would amount to altering the
substance of the clause. Further, the ruling empowers national courts of EU Member States to replace
those terms found unfair with legislative provisions where their inclusion is necessary for the continued
existence of the loan contract and annulment of such contract would make expose the consumer to

32


-----

unfavorable consequences. As a result of this ruling, increased uncertainty exists on our ability to
enforce collection terms on business to consumer secured loans. There can be no assurance that the
impact of these regulations or others like them enacted or imposed in other jurisdictions will not impede
our ability to conduct our operations, result in further litigation or have a negative impact on our
business.

_Debt collection_

Licensing requirements for debt collection services differ from market to market. Many markets have a
licensing requirement and supervision of compliance. In December 2016, the European Court of Justice
(Third Chamber) ruled that a debt collection agency which concludes a rescheduling agreement for an
unpaid credit on behalf of a lender but which acts as a credit intermediary only in an ancillary capacity
must be regarded as being a credit intermediary and is not subject to the obligation to provide the
consumer with pre-contractual information. Following the ruling, some countries in the EU have required
debt collection companies that offer installment plans to hold a consumer credit license so as to be
bound by the relevant EU directive. Such license requirements have already been imposed in some
countries. Although large incumbent credit management providers tend to be better placed to comply
with a high regulatory burden, stricter regulations in general may increase our compliance burden and
operating costs. Any temporary or permanent revocation of our debt collection licenses by the licensing
authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations or financial condition. Many of the countries in which we operate have also
implemented regulations providing limitations on costs for debt collection and duties of disclosure to
consumer customers.

Customers may become subject to insolvency or debt reorganization proceedings which may delay or
prevent the enforcement of the claims transferred to us. Collection of unsecured debt claims in the event
of bankruptcy or insolvency is generally limited by means of the funds available for distribution from the
insolvent estate. See “Regulatory Overview.”

**_A failure by the Company to comply with applicable laws, regulations, licenses and codes of_**
**_practice or failure of any of our employees to comply with our internal policies and procedures_**
**_may negatively affect our business._**

From time to time we may receive inquiries from regulatory authorities and it is our practice to cooperate
with such inquiries. We are also subject to regular audits by the regulatory authorities in various
countries where we operate. An adverse outcome of any such investigation or other inquiries from
regulatory authorities may result in:

- the institution of administrative, civil or criminal proceedings;

- sanctions and the payment of administrative fines and penalties, including potential suspension or
revocation of regulatory licenses depending on the severity and scale of any regulatory issues;

- changes in personnel, management or board of directors;

- our inability to conduct business due to the loss of our regulatory license or restrictions or conditions
being placed on our activities;

- increased review and scrutiny of our services by our clients, regulatory authorities and others; and

- negative media publicity and reputational damage.

Individual employees may act against our policies or instructions and either inadvertently or deliberately
violate applicable law and regulations, including competition, anti-corruption and anti-money-laundering
laws and regulations by engaging in prohibited activities such as price fixing or colluding with
competitors or breaching our internal policies. In addition, because we delegate a number of operational
responsibilities to our subsidiaries and our local managers retain substantial autonomy regarding the
management of our operations in their markets, we may face an increased likelihood of some or all of
the risks described above occurring. Our internal governance policies and instructions may prove to be
ineffective and, even if they are effective, there can be no assurance that we will not experience
incidents of accounting or operating irregularities, accounting misstatements or any of the risks

33


-----

described above. Such actions have occurred in the past and if they were to occur in the future they
may harm our reputation and, if we are held responsible, the resulting administrative fines and other
sanctions (civil or criminal) could be substantial. Any of these developments could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Furthermore, any companies we seek to acquire in the future or the employees of such companies may
not operate in accordance with the law, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to detect or
remedy any such non-compliance before such acquisition is complete or thereafter. Acquiring other
businesses is a core component of our business strategy and we have incurred expenses associated
with investigating and remedying legal non-compliance among companies that we have acquired in the
past. The foregoing risks are particularly relevant in the cases of acquisitions of companies, operations
or employees in non-traditional and emerging markets and jurisdictions.

Compliance with the regulatory framework requires dedicated time and resources. Failure to comply
with applicable laws, regulations and rules or with contractual compliance obligations could result in
investigations and enforcement actions, requisite licenses being revoked, not being renewed or being
made subject to more onerous or disadvantageous conditions, fines or the suspension or termination
of our ability to conduct collections. In addition, such failure to comply or revocation of a license, or other
actions by the Company may damage the reputation of our clients. Damage to our reputation, whether
because of a failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or internal rules, or revocation of a
license or any other regulatory action or our failure to comply with a contractual compliance obligation,
could deter vendors, particularly large financial institutions, which represent a significant proportion of
our clients and vendors, from choosing us as their debt purchasing provider. Any of these developments
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Our operations in multiple markets expose us to local risks in a number of markets._**

We have local operations in Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland,
France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland,
Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Our business is
subject to local risks due to our operations in multiple European markets and Brazil, including risks
relating to multiple national and local regulatory and compliance requirements, labor, licensing
requirements, consumer credit, data protection, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and terrorist
financing and other regulatory regimes, potential adverse tax consequences, antitrust regulations, an
inability to enforce remedies in certain jurisdictions and geopolitical and social conditions in certain
sectors of relevant markets. While entering new markets, we could face additional risks, including
incurring start-up losses for several years due to lower levels of business, ramp-up and training costs,
the lack of expertise and loss of key employees in such markets, differences in business cultures and
practices, the lack of adequate and available management teams to monitor and integrate these
operations, unfavorable commercial terms and difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, control
procedures and policies. Any negative impact caused by the foregoing risks could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, as we expand
into new jurisdictions, our business will be subject to applicable laws, regulations and licensing
requirements in those new jurisdictions, which may be different or more stringent than the jurisdictions
in which we currently operate. Moreover, our recent expansion of our operations to Brazil, and any
future expansion into other emerging markets, subjects us to additional risks, including political,
economic and legal and compliance risks and conditions being generally less predictable or robust than
in countries with more developed institutional structures.

**_We are subject to risks associated with our contracts for debt collection services, including our_**
**_ability to correctly assess pricing terms, early termination potential and reductions in the_**
**_volume of claims we service._**

The profitability of our debt collection services will generally depend upon our ability to successfully
calculate prices and our ability to manage day-to-day operations under these contracts. Under most of
our debt collection contracts we do not get paid unless a customer begins paying on a claim and we
may be unable to accurately predict the costs or identify the risks associated with these contracts or the
complexity of the services which may result in lower than expected margins, losses under these
contracts or even the loss of clients. Our contracts for debt collection services also subject us to penalty
clauses, benchmark clauses, extraordinary termination clauses and change of control provisions. If we
are unable to satisfy the terms of our contracts, the contracts may be terminated and we may lose

34


-----

clients and revenue. A number of our long-term debt service agreements are subject to early termination
rights on the part of the customer that, if exercised, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, our contracts for debt collection may
be terminated by the client for reasons unrelated to our performance (for example in the event of a
change of control in its ownership or sale of the underlying portfolio, as occurred in Spain and Italy in
2018 and 2019). In such circumstances we may be entitled to compensation, but there can be no
assurance that such compensation will fully reflect all losses suffered.

Many of our debt collection contracts have a stated term, typically one to two years, and, in some cases,
termination clauses permitting the client to cancel the contract at the client’s discretion following the
expiration of an agreed notice period. There can be no assurances that our clients will not exercise their
rights to terminate their contracts prior to expiration or that we will be successful in negotiating new
contracts with clients when such contracts expire. In addition, we are also exposed to unforeseen
changes in the scope of existing contracts, including changes in prices or volumes due to changes in
the general business or political landscape of our clients. Most of our debt collection contracts do not
have volume commitments and a client can eliminate or reduce the volume of claims they outsource to
us for debt collection without formally terminating the contract. We may have disputes or disagreements
with our clients as to contract terms or the level of services we have agreed to provide. The potential
impact of these risks may increase as we enter into larger contracts. If we are unable to fulfil our
obligations under our contracts for any reason, we risk the loss of revenue and fees under that contract,
the potential loss of a client and significant harm to our reputation. Any of our contracts could become
more costly than initially anticipated and as a result we may experience significant increases in our
operating costs or potential litigation. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_The value of our existing portfolios may deteriorate or we may not be able to collect sufficient_**
**_amounts on our portfolios to take advantage of opportunities for portfolio purchases as they_**
**_arise in the market._**

As the length of time involved in collecting on our existing portfolios may be extensive and the factors
affecting debt collection rates may be volatile and outside our control, we may be unable to identify or
cope with adverse economic trends, prevent the negative effects of changes in legislation (including
tax) as previously stated or make changes in our purchasing strategies in a timely manner. If the
assumptions we use in our models are incorrect, including but not limited to our assumptions that claims
are not time barred, that the age and balances of purchased claims are correctly stated by the sellers,
that customers are alive and that the claim is not a result of fraud, money laundering or financing of
terrorist activities or if some of the accounts in a portfolio behave differently from the way we expect,
the relevant portfolio could lose value and could result in subsequent negative revaluations in our
statement of financial position and a continuing deterioration in value over time as actual collections
may deviate significantly from the collection estimates produced by our pricing model as accounts age.

We purchase loans at significant discount to total collectible value on portfolio investments. These are
typically loans that customers have failed to repay and, in many cases, that the client has deemed
uncollectable. It is crucial for our business that we are able to identify portfolios that are of sufficient
quality for us to determine that we are likely to collect on the claims. Clients generally make numerous
attempts to recover on their overdue loans and other overdue receivables before selling them, often
using a combination of in-house recovery efforts and third-party collection agencies. These overdue
claims are difficult to collect and we may not collect a sufficient amount to cover the investment
associated with purchasing the portfolios of overdue receivables and the costs of running our business.
There can be no assurances that any of the claims contained in our purchased portfolios will eventually
be collected. Many of our claims are unsecured and an increase in bankruptcy filings involving
customers could impact our ability to collect on those claims. Further, limitations imposed on us by debt
originators of debt portfolios may adversely impact our operational flexibility. Contracts entered into with
our clients for the purchase of debt portfolios may impose various restrictions on our realization of value
from the debt portfolios and may restrict our flexibility in pursuing certain enforcement and collection
activities. If the cash flows from our existing portfolios and the debt portfolios we purchase in the future
are less than anticipated, we may not have sufficient funds to purchase new portfolios, may have to pay
a higher interest rate to finance the purchase of new portfolios or may have to accept lower returns on
new portfolios. Any of the above could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations or financial condition.

35


-----

**_The statistical models and data analysis tools that we use in our business may prove to be_**
**_inaccurate, preventing us from achieving anticipated levels of returns, and we may be unable to_**
**_appropriately identify and address underperforming portfolios._**

We use internally developed models and other data analysis tools extensively in our operations. For
example, we use our experience-driven models to estimate collection curves in relation to potential
portfolio purchases. At the time of purchase, however, we are likely to have imperfect information about
the precise age of the debt, the ability of the customer to pay, the time at which the customer is like to
pay and the cost required to service and collect on such debts. Moreover, our historical information
about portfolios may not be indicative of the characteristics of subsequent portfolios purchased from
the same client or within the same industry due to changes in business practices or economic
developments. Further, the availability of relevant data varies from market to market. In addition, certain
assets, such as secured loans, have different risk and collection profiles than the unsecured loans and
receivables that have historically been our main focus. There is a significant amount of management
judgment and estimation involved in purchasing and valuing portfolios and there can be no assurances
that management judgments and estimations will prove to be accurate. Furthermore, there can be no
assurances that we will be able to appropriately identify and address underperforming portfolios.

In addition, our ability to properly price portfolios may be adversely affected in instances in which we
purchase types of portfolios with which we have limited experience, portfolios in regions in which we
have limited experience or portfolios from clients with whom we have no prior dealings,. Lack of reliable
information or incorrect assumptions can lead to mispricing of purchased portfolios which may have an
adverse effect on the financial returns from such portfolios. Our statistical models and analysis tools
assess information provided by third parties, such as credit information suppliers and other mainstream
or public sources, or generated by software products. We have no control over the accuracy or
sufficiency of information received from such third parties. If such information is not accurate or
sufficient, we could incorrectly price new or incorrectly value existing portfolios, set client prices or
performance goals inaccurately or experience lower liquidation rates or larger operating expenses.

Similarly, due to the nature of our business, we are not able to independently verify the quality of all the
debt claims we purchase, in particular in forward flow debt purchase agreements, and we rely on
representations made by our debt purchase clients. The inaccuracy of any of such representations,
including in relation to the validity of the debt claims, may result in a loss of revenue and we may not
always be successful in recovering such losses from our customers.

There can be no assurances that any of the current or future loans contained in our portfolio investments
will eventually be collected. If we are not able to achieve forecasted levels of collection, valuation
impairments may be recognized, amortization may increase and revenue and returns on purchases of
portfolios may be reduced. This may in turn impact our modeling for future collections, which is less
reliable if we are not able to accurately predict the quantity and identity of customers who reduce their
debt payments, or the magnitude of such reductions. Furthermore, some of our contracts contain
guaranteed solution rate commitments pursuant to which we guarantee a minimum level of collections
to our clients. If we fail to reach these collection requirements, as has occurred in the past, we may
have to make significant payments to such clients or such clients may reduce the amount of overdue
loans and receivables that we are entitled to collect under these contracts. Any of the foregoing factors
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We may not be able to purchase portfolios at appropriate prices or of sufficient quality._**

Portfolios do not become available for purchase on a consistent basis through the year. The availability
of portfolios at prices that generate an appropriate return depends on a number of factors both within
and outside of our control, such as the levels of overdue loans and other receivables, volumes of
portfolio sales by clients and competitive factors affecting potential purchasers and debt originators.
Additionally, an increase in demand for portfolios among competitors, including financial investors,
could result in portfolios being sold to competitors.

There can be no assurances that we will be able to identify a sufficient volume of portfolios at
appropriate prices. If we are unable to identify portfolios at appropriate prices or of sufficient quality, we
may have to purchase loans of asset types or in industries in which we have little or no experience, or
in industries where it is more difficult to collect on overdue receivables because of secrecy
requirements, for example the healthcare or legal sector. Purchases in these asset types or industries

36


-----

may impair our ability to collect on these claims and consequently we may not generate a profit from
these debt purchases. A potential inconsistency in the availability of portfolios for purchase may mean
that during certain financial reporting periods we may make few or no purchases of debt.

If we are unable to identify sufficient levels of attractive portfolios and generate an appropriate return
on portfolio investments, we may experience difficulties covering such expenses and may, as a
consequence, have to reduce the number of our collection personnel or take other measures to reduce
costs. These developments could lead to disruptions in our operations, loss of efficiency, low employee
morale and retention, fewer experienced employees and excess costs. Any of these developments
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Failure to renew existing debt collection contracts or win new debt collection contracts may_**
**_adversely affect our revenue._**

We obtain many of our debt collection contracts through a competitive bidding process and the debt
collection contracts that we expect to seek in the foreseeable future likely will be subject to a competitive
bidding process. We may be required to compete to renew existing debt collection contracts that have
in the past been awarded to us without competition or as to which we have historically been the
incumbent provider of debt collection services. We may also be required to enter into debt collection
contracts at price levels or with margins that are lower than we find acceptable. We may not be afforded
the opportunity in the future to bid on debt collection contracts that are held by other companies and
are scheduled to expire if the existing contract is extended. In addition, we cannot be certain that all our
existing customers will continue to use our debt collection services in the future, as occurred in our
Spanish businesses in 2018 and 2019 which had a material effect on CMS revenue in those
jurisdictions. Our inability to renew contracts with existing customers or to find suitable replacements
could have and has in the past had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_Failure to replace terminated forward flow agreements or successfully manage our_**
**_commitments under forward flow agreements may adversely affect our revenue._**

For the year ended December 31, 2018, 24% of our aggregate debt purchased involved forward flow
agreements. A forward flow agreement is an arrangement in which we agree to purchase claims based
on specific parameters from a third-party supplier on a periodic basis at a set price over a specified time
period. We could lose a potential source of income if we are unable to renew or replace any volume
represented by our forward flow agreements upon termination or expiration. Forward flow agreements
are typically not long-term contracts in nature and typically do not provide medium- to long-term
assurance on purchasing levels.

Commitments under forward flow contracts are typically not more than 12 months. However, depending
upon the length of the contractual arrangements, forward flow agreements typically contain termination
clauses that allow the arrangement to be terminated in certain circumstances. We may be required to
purchase debt under a forward flow agreement for an amount higher than we would otherwise have
agreed at the time of purchase, which could result in reduced returns. In a more competitive
environment, we could be faced with a decision to either decrease our purchasing volume or agree to
forward flow agreements at increased prices or with less contractual protections, any of which could
have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations. We generally contemplate future
fluctuations in the value of the debt that we purchase through forward flow agreements, but such
fluctuations in value may exceed our expectations. If we are unable to contractually terminate an
agreement we may have to accept claims that are of a lower quality than what we intended to purchase,
which could result in lower returns. If the quality of debt purchased varies from our pricing assumptions,
we may also price the contract improperly. Any of these developments could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We may not be able to procure sufficient funding at favorable terms to purchase further_**
**_portfolios as they become available._**

Historically, we have funded purchases of portfolios through borrowings, capital injections by our
shareholders and cash generated by our operations and, in certain cases, through partnerships with
co-investors. Our ability to obtain funding in the future from these sources will therefore depend on our
performance and prospects, as well as factors over which we do not exercise control. Such factors may

37


-----

include weak economic and capital market conditions during or prior to periods in which attractive
portfolios are available for purchase, the ability and willingness of banks to lend to our industry generally
or to us in particular, and changes in fiscal, monetary and other government policies, among others.
There can be no assurances that the terms of our existing or future indebtedness will not limit our ability
to incur additional indebtedness to fund such portfolio purchases. An inability to procure sufficient
funding or co-investments at favorable terms to purchase portfolios as they become available could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_A material failure in banking systems could negatively affect our business._**

We depend on banking systems to execute payment transactions in connection with our business. A
systematic shutdown of the banking industry would impede our ability to process funds on behalf of
clients and to collect on claims. As such, any material failure in banking systems could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_As we increase our focus on certain business areas and move into new business areas, our_**
**_operations will become increasingly complex._**

In recent years we have increased our focus on certain business areas, such as SME loans, secured
loans and RES (which involves the servicing, maintenance and sale of real estate owned by our clients)
on behalf of third-party clients. We may also expand these operations into other jurisdictions. This will
likely result in our operations becoming increasingly complex and we must maintain and increase our
competence within these areas in order to remain competitive and profitable. For example, SME loans
have different pricing and collection profiles, RES on behalf of third-party clients is connected with and
exposed to real estate prices and secured loans have different risk and collection profiles than
unsecured loans and receivables. Secured loans and RES on behalf of third-party clients require
different competence and data capabilities in order to price, service and manage such portfolios
efficiently. Our ability to properly price and collect on SME, secured and real estate loans and
receivables may be adversely affected by our limited experience in these areas, when compared to our
more in depth experience in unsecured loans and receivables, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Acquisitions or carve-out transactions may prove unsuccessful or strain or divert our resources_**
**_and we may not be able to manage our growth effectively._**

During the periods under review, we have made a number of substantial business acquisitions,
including the Merger, the April 2018 agreement with Banca Intesa Sanpaolo to form a new joint venture,
the December 2018 acquisition of properties from Ibercaja, the April 2019 acquisition of Solvia from
Banco Sababell and the June 2019 partnership with Piraeus Bank, as well as carve-out transactions.
The success of such acquisitions, strategic transactions and carve-out transactions is dependent upon,
_inter alia, appropriate due diligence having been conducted, on the negotiation of favorable terms and_
the successful integration of the acquired businesses. It may take longer than anticipated to realize
anticipated benefits from such acquisitions, carve-out transactions and other strategic transactions and
there can be no assurances that we will be able to extract any anticipated synergies or that such
potential benefits will outweigh the associated costs. In addition, we may experience delays in
integrating with our existing operations any businesses that we acquire or carve-out transactions
involving collection units that we complete. Further, such acquisitions, carve-out transactions, and other
strategic transactions may place additional constraints on our resources, including diverting the
attention of our management from existing business operations to such integration processes.

As part of the Merger, we were required by the EU Commission to divest certain of Lindorff and Intrum
Justitia’s businesses in Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Estonia and Norway respectively (the
“Divestment”). As part of the sale of Lindorff’s operations in Denmark, Estonia, Finland and Sweden
as well as Intrum Justitia’s historic operations in Norway (the “Carveout Business”) to the Lowell Group
in March 2018 in accordance with the European Commission’s terms for permitting the Merger we were
required to enter into three-year brand licensing agreements with the purchaser for the “Lindorff” brand
in Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Estonia and the “Intrum Justitia” brand in Norway. Following the
Divestment, we no longer control the use of such brands in the jurisdictions subject to the licensing
agreements and cannot assure you that the licensee under such agreement will refrain from operating
the Carveout Business in a manner that would cause reputational damage to the Company. Any of the

38


-----

risks associated with our lack of control over such licensee, or their use of the Lindorff and Intrum Justitia
brands, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.

We have historically expanded through both external and organic growth and we plan to continue to
grow by selectively identifying potential acquisitions of portfolios and businesses as well as carve-out
opportunities with respect to collection units. If we do acquire other businesses or complete other carveout transactions, we may not be able to successfully integrate these businesses and assets with our
own and we may be unable to maintain our standards, controls and policies which may result in
compliance issues, goodwill write-offs and damage to our reputation. For example, when integrating
new businesses and collection units, we face costs and security risks due to the need to integrate the
IT platform of the purchased company or carved-out operations into our existing IT platform.
Additionally, if we purchase a large portfolio we may be unable to successfully integrate it into our
existing operations, the successful integration of the portfolio may take longer than anticipated or the
costs associated with successfully integrating it may be higher than anticipated. Further, we are subject
to the risks associated with write-downs and impairments of goodwill in connection with acquisitions.

Our growth strategy includes opportunistically entering into new geographies or new business areas
through selective acquisitions and carve-outs that we believe will complement and enhance our panEuropean service offering. For instance, in June 2016 Lindorff acquired Aktua and in October 2016 we
acquired a portfolio of receivables from Erste Bank Hungary. These acquisitions represented our first
major entry into the secured loans market. In February 2017, we completed our acquisition of 1st Credit
Limited and its subsidiaries (“1st Credit”), an acquisition which marked our re-establishment of
operations in the United Kingdom market (“1st Credit Acquisition”), in October 2017 we entered the
Greek market by acquiring a debt portfolio from Eurobank and in July 2018 we expanded into Brazil
when we acquired a majority shareholding position in the credit management company iPlatform.
Integrating recently acquired business and achieving the expected operational synergies will require
the dedication of management resources that may temporarily divert attention from our day-to-day
operations and we may face unforeseen challenges in operating within unfamiliar commercial, cultural
and regulatory environments. For example, following the acquisition of the portfolio of receivables from
Erste Bank Hungary, amendments to local legislation affected the process through which collections on
assets may be achieved and we were required to adapt our expectations to account for this change
accordingly. The failure to successfully integrate recently acquired business or to manage our entry into
new geographies or business areas generally could have an adverse impact on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

There can be no assurances that we will be able to manage our growth effectively and that our
infrastructure, facilities and personnel will be adequate to support our future operations or to effectively
adapt to future growth. Any of these developments could lead to operational risks or have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Joint ventures, business alliances or consortia arrangements present financial, legal,_**
**_operational and/or compliance risks similar to those involved in acquisitions of control and may_**
**_incur substantial indebtedness._**

We are currently party to, and may in the future enter into further, joint ventures, business alliances or
consortia to acquire assets or other types of investments (whether under instruments, participations or
sub-participations, a total return or pass-through contracts or any other similar arrangements) which
could involve the same or similar risks and uncertainties as are involved in acquisitions of control.
Moreover, to the extent we subsequently increase our level of participation in the interests in the assets
of any of these joint ventures, business alliances or consortia, we may be required to pay deferred
consideration. As part of our participation in joint ventures, business alliances or consortia, we may be
subject to partnership or other forms of shareholder agreements that may restrict our ability to control
or direct the actions of such joint ventures, business alliances or consortia. Any arrangement in which
we do not fully control business operations has in the past presented, and may in the future present,
greater financial, legal, operational and/or compliance risks. In addition, certain of our existing joint
ventures have, and any future joint ventures, business alliances or consortia may, incur substantial
indebtedness which is only reflected on our balance sheet to the extent of our proportionate interest in
such entity. As such, the Issuer’s Financial Statements do not, and may not, present the full extent of
such indebtedness.

39


-----

Certain of our joint venture arrangements and majority-owned subsidiaries include put options in favor
of our joint venture partners and minority co-investors on pre-agreed terms. If such put options are
exercised, we could be required to purchase joint venture partners’ or minority co-investors’ interests
even if the value of the interests is less than the purchase price. We may need to procure additional
funding to meet such obligations and there can be no assurances that we will be able to incur such
additional funding on favorable terms or at all.

**_Anticipated synergies from the Merger or operational efficiency improvements from continued_**
**_efficiency improvements programs may not materialize._**

As of June 30, 2019, we estimate that 90% of the synergies that we originally estimated we would
achieve in connection with the Merger have been successfully implemented. Among the synergies that
we expected to realize as a result of with the Merger are operational synergies from optimization of
operations centers, consolidation of administrative and support functions, harmonization of IT systems
and application development/maintenance and increased scale in procurement. Our ability to realize
additional or the full amount of the anticipated synergies of the Merger depends on a variety of factors
including, among others, our ability to fully integrate Lindorff into our existing business, as well as other
legal, regulatory and contractual restrictions.

External factors beyond our control, such as systemic failures in our industry or the industry sectors of
our clients and changes in fiscal and monetary policies, may impact our ability to realize the expected
synergies in connection with the Merger. Our estimated synergies from the Merger are subject to a
number of assumptions about the timing, execution and costs associated with realizing the synergies.
There can be no assurance that such assumptions turn out to be correct and, as a result, the amount
of synergies that we will actually realize over time may differ significantly from the ones that we currently
estimate. We may also continue to incur significant costs in integrating Intrum and Lindorff. Such
integration and disposal costs, as applicable, may be higher than expected. In addition, to the extent
we determine that actions required to be taken to achieve any such synergies could disrupt or otherwise
harm the ongoing operation of our business, or the costs associated with realizing any such synergies
outweigh the anticipated benefits, we may decide to take alternative actions or forego the achievement
of those synergies. Failure to achieve the expected synergies as currently anticipated may have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

In addition, as part of our efforts to further increase our operational efficiency, and building on the largely
completed merger synergies from the Merger, we are targeting further efficiency improvements in our
bottom-line earnings in 2020. This will include activities such as fully integrating Solvia into our existing
operations and carefully prioritizing key projects within IT to ensure we benefit from the size and scale
of our organization.

Our ability to realize such operational efficiency improvements depends on a variety of factors including,
among others, legal, regulatory and contractual restrictions. External factors beyond our control, such
as systemic failures in our industry or the industry sectors of our clients and changes in fiscal and
monetary policies, may impact our ability to realize such operational efficiency improvements. Our
estimated operational efficiency improvements are subject to a number of assumptions about the timing,
execution and costs associated with realizing such operational efficiency improvements. There can be
no assurance that such assumptions turn out to be correct and, as a result, the amount of operational
efficiency improvements that we will actually realize over time may differ significantly from the ones that
we currently estimate. We may also continue to incur significant costs achieving such operational
efficiency improvements, which may be higher than expected. In addition, to the extent we determine
that actions required to be taken to achieve any such operational efficiency improvements could disrupt
or otherwise harm the ongoing operation of our business, or the costs associated with realizing any
such operational efficiency improvements outweigh the anticipated benefits, we may decide to take
alternative actions or forego their achievement. Failure to achieve the operational efficiency
improvements as currently anticipated may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition or results of operations.

**_The continued integration of Intrum Justitia and Lindorff could result in operating difficulties_**
**_and other adverse consequences._**

The continued integration of Intrum and Lindorff may create unforeseen operating difficulties and
expenditures and pose significant management, administrative and financial challenges to our
business. These challenges include:

- integration of Lindorff’s and Intrum’s businesses in a cost effective manner, including operations
centers, IT infrastructure, data analytic capacities, management information and financial control
systems, procurement, marketing, branding, customer service and product offerings;

- increased pressure on central Group practices, such as human resources or Group finance, or as
a result of Group size and complexity;

- any revenue disynergies due to the overlapping client base and service offerings of Intrum and
Lindorff;

- outstanding or unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual, labor or other issues arising from the
Merger and the disposal of the Carveout Business;

- integration of different company and management cultures;

- restrictions on our ability to solicit key personnel, sales and customer relations employees, account
managers, portfolio investments analysts and other important personnel that were employees of
the Carveout Business on June 12, 2017, due to non-solicitation clauses in the commitments
agreed with the European Commission, which will apply for a period of 30 months after the
divestment of the Carveout Business; and

- retention, hiring and training of key personnel.

In such circumstances, our failure to effectively integrate Intrum and Lindorff could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the Merger may
generate higher than expected integration, or disposal, costs, as applicable, as a result of unforeseen
risks or liabilities or as a result of delays, or other financial and operational difficulties. Moreover, the
Merger has required, and will likely continue to require, substantial amounts of certain of our
management’s time and focus, which could potentially affect their ability to operate the business. Any
difficulties encountered in the integration of Intrum and Lindorff could result in higher implementation
costs and/or lower benefits or revenue than anticipated, which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition or result of operations.

**_Negative real estate market trends may have a negative impact on our business._**

We have a limited number of real estate investments that are subject to real estate market terms, which
may impact both price and liquidity. The real estate market is cyclical and depends on a number of
macroeconomic factors. In particular, market supply and demand are influenced by general conditions
of the economy, interest rate variations, inflation trends, the tax and regulatory systems applicable and
market liquidity. An imbalance in supply, such as occurred in Spain from 2008 to 2015, could have a
significant impact on the fees we receive. In addition, conditions making it unfavorable for buyers to
purchase real estate owned (“REO”) could result in lower recovery volumes and/or a prolonged period
may pass before we are able to successfully recover loans. Purchasers of REOs are often dependent
on financing and unfavorable market conditions may result in such financing becoming unavailable. In
addition, certain of our clients have undertaken to extend credit to buyers of REOs from their portfolios,
however, there is no guarantee that such financing will continue to be available to prospective buyers
at acceptable terms, which could impeded our ability to perform under our contracts. Any of the
foregoing situations would delay and/or make it more difficult for us to recover debt or commercialize
REOs and therefore may negatively affect this segment of our business operations.

**_We may not be able to successfully maintain, manage and develop our IT infrastructure platform_**
**_or data analysis systems, anticipate, manage or adopt technological advances within our_**
**_industry or prevent a breach or disruption of the security of our IT infrastructure platform and_**
**_data analysis systems._**

We rely on our IT infrastructure platform and data analysis systems. The importance of our IT
infrastructure and data analytics to our business subjects us to inherent costs and risks associated with
integrating, maintaining, upgrading, replacing and changing these systems, including impairment of our
information technology, substantial capital expenditures and demands on management time. For
example, the purchase of existing collection operations through acquisitions or carve-out transactions
in order to expand into a new country may force us to upgrade the IT platform and data analysis systems
of the newly acquired operations to meet our standards, causing increased capital expenditures and
demands on management time.

IT and telecommunications technologies are evolving rapidly and are characterized by short product life
cycles. We may not be successful in anticipating, managing or adopting technological changes on a
timely basis. We may not be successful in implementing improvements of our IT or data analysis
systems, including reducing the number of our collection systems and improving operation efficiency
through further IT development, which could result in additional costs. The cost of these improvements
could be higher than anticipated or result in management not being able to devote sufficient attention
to other areas of our business. We depend on having the capital resources necessary to invest in new
technologies to purchase and service claims and there can be no assurances that adequate capital
resources will be available to us at the appropriate time. Furthermore, if we become unable to continue
to acquire, aggregate or use such information and data in the manner or to the extent in which it is
currently acquired, aggregated and used, due to lack of resources, regulatory restrictions or any other
reason, we may lose a significant competitive advantage.

**_Our operations could suffer from operational process capacity issues or other potential_**
**_disruptions, including and in particular telecommunications or technology downtime or data_**
**_center failures._**

Our success depends on sophisticated telecommunications and computer equipment, as well as
software systems. In the normal course of business, we must record and process significant amount of
data quickly and accurately to access, maintain and expand the databases we use for our pricing and
collection activities. We also use these systems to identify and contact large numbers of consumers
and record results of our collection efforts. These systems could be interrupted by terrorist attacks,
natural disasters, power losses, computer viruses or other similar events. Any failure of our systems,
especially if it impacts our backup and disaster recovery systems, would disrupt our operations and
materially affect our business. Any temporary or permanent loss of our ability to use our
telecommunications or computer equipment and software systems could disrupt our operations and
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, financial returns or results of operations.

**_Unauthorized disclosure of data, whether through cyber security breaches, computer viruses or_**
**_otherwise, or illegal storage or use of customer data by us could expose us to liability,_**
**_protracted and costly litigation, affect our operations and damage our reputation._**

We process sensitive personal consumer data and merchant customer data as part of our business and
therefore must comply with strict data protection and privacy laws in the EU. These laws and rules
impose certain standards of protection and safeguarding on our ability to collect and use personal
information relating to customers and end-consumers, and could make us liable in the event of a loss
of control of such data or as a result of unauthorized third-party access. Unauthorized data disclosure
could occur through cyber security breaches as a result of human error, external hacking, malware
infection, malicious or accidental user activity, internal security breaches and physical security breaches
due to unauthorized personnel gaining physical access.

Any security breach in our IT infrastructure platform and data analysis systems or any temporary or
permanent failure in these systems could cause significant disruptions to our operations. We may need
to further enhance capabilities and resilience and we may be subject to future attempts to gain
unauthorized access to confidential or sensitive information. Our websites could potentially suffer cyberattacks that could disrupt our IT infrastructure platform, payment services platform and data analysis
systems and impair our ability to provide online services. In addition, in the event of a catastrophic

42


-----

occurrence, our ability to protect our infrastructure and maintain ongoing operations could be
significantly impaired. Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be successful in
mitigating the effects of a catastrophic occurrence, such as fire, flood, tornado, power loss or
telecommunications failures for some or all of our IT infrastructure platform and data analysis systems.
Any of these developments or any failure to remedy material weaknesses identified in our IT systems
could hinder or prevent us from using our IT infrastructure platform or data analysis systems as part of
our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial
condition.

**_We rely on publicly available data provided by third-party sources and an increase in the cost_**
**_of, or a failure to receive, the available data could negatively affect our business._**

We rely partly on publicly available data provided by multiple credit information suppliers and other
sources in order to operate our business. Our business, along with the businesses of our competitors,
could be negatively affected if any third-party sources were to stop providing this data for any reason,
including a change in laws or regulations, or if they were to considerably raise the price of their services.
Any of these developments could hinder or prevent us from using our data analysis as part of our
business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial
condition.

**_Improper disclosure of our clients’ sensitive data, customer data or a breach of data protection_**
**_laws could negatively affect our business or reputation._**

We collect, handle, process and retain large amounts of potentially sensitive or confidential information
such as personal information of customers, including names and account numbers, locations, contact
information and other account specific data. Any security or privacy breaches of these databases could
expose us to liability, increase our expenses relating to resolution of these breaches, harm our
reputation and deter clients from conducting business with us. We rely on our data analysis system to
record and process data quickly and accurately to access, maintain and expand the databases we use
for our debt collection and for our analysis of potential debt purchases. Our ability to conduct our
business, such as the ability to price the purchase of portfolios, trace customers and develop tailored
repayment plans, depends on our ability to use customer data in our data analysis system. Our ability
to obtain, retain, share and otherwise process customer data is governed by data protection laws,
privacy requirements and other regulatory restrictions, including, for example, that personal data may
only be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes, and may only be processed in a manner
consistent with these purposes. Further, the collected personal data must be adequate, relevant and
not excessive in relation to the purposes for which it is collected and processed, and it must not be kept
in a form that permits identification of customers for a longer period of time than necessary for the
purposes of the collection. It is possible that our security controls over personal customer data, our
training of employees and partners on data protection, and other data protection practices we follow
may not prevent the improper collection, retention, disclosure or processing of such sensitive
information in breach of contract and applicable law, which may vary across the jurisdictions in which
we operate. Any failure to collect, retain, use or process customer data in compliance with applicable
laws could result in the revocation of our licenses in the jurisdictions in which we operate, our licenses
being made subject to more onerous or disadvantageous terms, monetary fines, criminal charges and
breach of contractual arrangements.

The data protection laws in each of the countries in which we operate are extensive and our data
collection systems may not be in compliance with such laws from time to time or we may not change or
be able to change our data analysis systems to adapt to any changes in law in a timely manner. A
significant violation of data protection laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations or financial condition.

**_Failure to protect our customer data from unauthorized use could negatively affect our_**
**_business._**

Failure to protect, monitor and control the use of our customer data could cause us to lose a competitive
advantage. We rely on a combination of contractual provisions and confidentiality procedures to protect
our customer data and our customer data is stored and protected in our IT infrastructure platform with
access limitations. These measures afford only limited protection and competitors or others may gain
access to our customer data. Our customer data could be subject to unauthorized use,

43


-----

misappropriation, or disclosure, despite having required our employees, consultants, debt collection
partners and clients to enter into confidentiality agreements. There can be no assurances that such
confidentiality agreements will not be breached or will be of sufficient duration and that adequate
remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure. Policing unauthorized use
of such rights can be difficult and expensive and adequate remedies may not be available or available
in an acceptable time frame. A failure to protect our customer data from unauthorized use, or to comply
with current applicable or future laws or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Our senior management team is important to our continued success. Demand in our industry_**
**_for personnel with the relevant capabilities and experience is high and the loss of, or negative_**
**_publicity in connection with, one or more members of senior management could negatively_**
**_affect our business._**

Our future success partially depends on the skills, experience and efforts of our senior management
and other key personnel and our ability to retain such members of the management team and other key
employees. Our senior management possesses significant experience in the industry and our ability to
retain their industry knowledge is a key driver of our success. The demand in our industry for personnel
with the relevant capabilities and experience is high and our success in attracting and retaining
employees is not guaranteed. There can be no assurances that we will be able to retain our executive
officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified management in the future.

As announced in our press release dated May 7, 2019, we are aware of an ongoing Danish criminal
investigation regarding money laundering at Danske Bank’s branch in Estonia which involves a large
number of current and former employees at Danske Bank, including Mikael Ericson, our CEO. When
our CEO took on the role as Head of International Banking at Danske Bank in March 2014, the problems
regarding money laundering in Danske Bank’s branch in Estonia were already known and his
assignment included leading the closure of the related business in Estonia. The possible infringements
involving our CEO do not entail money laundering, but rather are connected with possible shortcomings
in the routines for preventing money laundering during the time when the closure of Danske Bank’s
business in Estonia was ongoing. Such shortcomings are not punishable under Swedish criminal law.
Our CEO left Danske Bank in March 2016. Our CEO will continue to contribute to the criminal and
regulatory investigations and be available to Danish and potentially Swedish authorities. Our board is
fully aware of the ongoing investigation and has publicly confirmed our support of our CEO. While we
do not currently anticipate any penalties will be imposed on him, there can, however, be no assurances
that formal proceedings will not be brought in connection with this matter in Denmark, Estonia or
elsewhere, including against our CEO. In addition, the investigation or any related proceedings may
result in the diversion of our CEO’s time.

The loss of the services of, or negative publicity in connection with, our senior management and other
key personnel could seriously impair our ability to continue to purchase portfolios or collect on claims,
to deliver on our strategies and to manage and expand our business, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We may not be able to hire and retain enough sufficiently trained personnel to support our_**
**_operations._**

The debt collection industry is labor intensive and we compete for qualified personnel with companies
in our industry and in other industries. There can be no assurances that we will be able to continue to
hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel or be flexible enough to react to changing
market environments. Our growth requires that we continually hire and train new debt collectors. A
higher turnover rate among our debt collectors will increase our recruiting and training costs and limit
the number of experienced debt collection personnel available to service our and our clients’ portfolios.
If this were to occur, we would not be able to service such portfolios effectively and this would reduce
our ability to continue our growth and to operate profitability. We also have a number of employees that
possess critical knowledge about our IT infrastructure platform, data analysis systems and our debt
purchasing operations and an inability to retain these employees could negatively impact our business.
For example, if we were to lose the head of debt purchasing in any of the countries where we operate,
we would need to shift resources from the Company-level to the specific country and could experience
a reduction in purchasing levels until we find a suitable, locally-based replacement. Any of these

44


-----

developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial
condition.

**_Increases in labor costs, potential labor disputes and work stoppages could negatively affect_**
**_our business._**

Our financial performance is affected by the availability of qualified personnel and the cost of labor. For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, we had an average of 8,000 full-time employees
including temporary employees. There are currently collective bargaining agreements in place with
certain unions. If we are unable to maintain satisfactory labor agreements with our unionized employees
and works councils, we could experience a disruption of our operations, which could impede our ability
to provide services to our clients. In addition, an increased number of unionized employees could cause
us to incur additional labor costs and increase the related risks we face. Potential labor disputes could
disrupt our operations. Further, an increased demand for our employees from competitors could
increase costs associated with employee compensation. Any of these developments could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Litigation, investigations and proceedings may negatively affect our business._**

We may be adversely affected by judgments, settlements, unanticipated costs or other effects of legal
and administrative proceedings now pending or that may be instituted in the future or from investigations
by regulatory bodies or administrative agencies. Tax audits are regularly performed in most of the
jurisdictions where we operate and we are currently party to a number of ordinary tax audits. Depending
on the outcome of such tax litigations, audits and investigations, tax authorities may launch tax audits
or investigations relating to subsequent periods. We may become subject to claims and a number of
judicial and administrative proceedings considered normal in the course of our operations, including
consumer credit disputes with customers, labor disputes, contract disputes, intellectual property
disputes, government audits and proceedings, client disputes and tort claims. In some proceedings, the
claimant may seek damages as well as other remedies, which, if granted, would require expenditures
on our part and we may ultimately incur costs relating to these proceedings that exceed our present or
future financial accruals or insurance coverage. Even if we or our directors, officers and employees, as
applicable, are not ultimately found to be liable, defending claims or lawsuits could be expensive and
time consuming, divert management resources, damage our reputation and attract regulatory inquiries.
Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
or financial condition. For further details regarding material legal and administrative proceedings to
which we are currently party, see “Business—Legal and Administrative Proceedings.”

**_Our effective tax rate may increase._**

As a multinational company, we are subject to taxation in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective
tax rate is subject to fluctuation from one period to the next because the income tax rates for each year
are a function of many factors, including: (i) taxable income levels and the effects of a mix of profits
(losses) earned by the Company in numerous tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates;
(ii) our ability to utilize deferred tax assets; (iii) taxes, refunds, interest or penalties resulting from tax
audits; (iv) the magnitude of various credits and deductions as a percentage of total taxable income;
and (v) changes in tax laws, the interpretation of such tax laws or changes to national corporate income
tax rates, including with respect to interest deductibility on intragroup loans. Changes in the mix of these
items may cause our effective tax rate to fluctuate between periods, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Tax structuring within international groups has become increasingly a corporate social responsibility
issue and there is currently strong political pressure to change the international tax environment. In
2015, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (the “OECD”) released various
reports under its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) action plan to reform international tax
systems and prevent tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning. These actions aim to standardize and
modernize global corporate tax policy, including cross-border taxes, transfer-pricing documentation
rules and nexus-based tax incentive practices. The reports have a very broad scope including, but not
limited to, neutralizing the effects of hybrid mismatch arrangements, limiting base erosion involving
interest deductions and other financial payments, countering harmful tax practices, preventing the
granting of treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances and imposing mandatory disclosure rules. It
is the responsibility of OECD members to consider how the BEPS recommendations should be reflected

45


-----

in their national legislation. In light of the BEPS action plan, launched by the OECD and supported by
the EU, and its rapid development, there are indications that there is support for global tax coordination
among jurisdictions which could have a significant impact on the international taxation landscape in
which we operate.

**_We depend on certain third parties as part of the supply chain to provide our services._**

Our business is dependent on a number of key relationships with third parties as part of the supply
chain to provide our services. We outsource certain IT functions, and the success of this depends on
our ability to organize the outsourcing effectively and to share certain data with such third parties. We
also rely on third-party partners to collect on claims located outside of the geographic markets in which
we have local debt collection operations. The third parties that we engage to carry out such international
debt collection services are subject to more limited supervision by us than our own local operations,
which may make us subject to additional risks in relation to these services, such as potential noncompliance and business integrity issues which could significantly harm our reputation. We also
contract field collectors to carry out debt collection on our behalf and some of our entities also outsource
their amicable collection services to call centers, some of which are located in countries in which we do
not otherwise have operations. Additionally, we typically utilize bailiffs to assist with seizure of property,
garnishments and other court ordered solutions and to enforce certain successfully resolved legal
claims. There can be no assurances that we will successfully eliminate the risk that a third party or bailiff
may act outside of the applicable frameworks or our own policies and procedures. Our reputation and
relationships with our clients could be adversely affected if these bailiffs do not act in accordance with
applicable legal frameworks.

If any of these third-party providers do not meet the agreed service levels, or if there were to be any
breach in the data protection of any of these third-party providers who may have access to the
confidential information of our clients, this could adversely affect our reputation and our relationships
with our clients. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations or financial condition or potentially lead to administrative fines or sanctions.

**_Recent and future changes in Swedish tax legislation could affect our tax position._**

Sweden has, like several other countries where we operate, tax limitation deductions rules for interest
on costs. On June 14, 2018, the Swedish parliament enacted new and additional interest deduction
limitation rules. The law contains, inter alia, a general limitation of interest deductions in the corporate
sector where the cap for a deduction of net interest expenses is calculated as 30% of tax EBITDA, with
certain exceptions. The rules entered into force on January 1, 2019 and are applied for the first time in
the financial year beginning after December 31, 2018. If the Company or its Swedish subsidiaries’ net
interest expenses represent a substantial portion in relation to its tax EBITDA, or if any other additional
restriction on the deductibility of interest expenses is introduced in Sweden, the Group’s tax burden
could increase, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or
financial condition.

Sweden also has tax legislation regulating taxation of income from foreign controlled companies (“CFC”)
in low tax jurisdictions. On January 1, 2019 new and amended Swedish CFC-legislation entered into
force, generally broadening the applicability of the rules. The amendments have been undertaken in
order to comply with the EU anti-tax avoidance directive (EU 2016/1164). The new and stricter rules
include, inter alia, a lowered threshold for the qualifying interest stake in companies covered by the
CFC-legislation, and a wider scope of companies considered subject to CFC-taxation. Within the
EU/EEA entities in several jurisdictions, including _inter alia_ Malta and corporations acting within the
banking, finance, and insurance industry in several member states may, as a result of the amended
legislation, be subject to the Swedish CFC-legislation. If the Company directly or indirectly holds
participations in foreign companies qualifying for CFC-taxation, the Group’s tax burden could increase,
and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial
condition.

**_Recent changes in Norwegian tax law may limit or prevent us from applying tax deductions_**
**_arising from certain loans and future changes in Norwegian tax law, regulations and their_**
**_application may impact our tax liability, possibly with retroactive effect._**

Norwegian tax law imposes rules concerning limitations on interest which could imply limitations on the
rights to deduct interest for our Norwegian subsidiaries.

Under the new rules introduced with effect on January 1, 2019, interest deductions on all loans are
limited to 25% of a specifically defined profit (“taxable EBITDA”) for companies with tax liability to
Norway that are deemed part of a group. The right to deduct interest is, however, not limited if the total
net interest costs of the group companies with tax liability to Norway (independently or combined) are
NOK 25 million or lower. The borrower may nevertheless maintain a right to deduct all interest expenses
if the equity ratio of the Norwegian borrower or alternatively the average of all Norwegian entities in the
group (provided that they deliver a consolidated balance that includes all group companies subject to
Norwegian taxes), is equal to or higher than the equity ratio for the group globally (subject to a safety
margin). The calculation of the equity ratio is based on the situation at the year-end prior to the income
year, i.e. the equity ratio for 2019 is based on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2018.

For companies that are not deemed part of a group, limitation on interest deduction rules may apply
with regard to loans granted from certain related parties if the net interest paid on such a loan exceeds
NOK 5 million.

Under the interest limitation rules, the intercompany lender (if taxable in Norway) will be taxed for its
interest income even though the borrower’s right to deduct interest costs will be limited under the rule.

The interest limitation rules also contain provisions under which external loans may in this respect in
certain situations be regarded as internal loans. For example, where a parent company has provided a
guarantee for its subsidiary’s debt. The subsidiary’s external loan will then be reclassified as an internal
loan subject to the rules concerning limitations on interest deductions.

Our loans to applicable Norwegian subsidiaries are limited and interest limitation rules therefore have
a limited impact on our current structure.

There may be also be changes in Norwegian tax law imposing withholding tax on interest. The Ministry
of Finance has stated that a consultation paper relating to the introduction of withholding tax on interest
payments will be submitted for consultation. It is however not clear if and when such consultation paper
(and any subsequent tax bill) will be presented, the outcome of the parliamentary process or when the
changes will be put into force (or whether any exemptions will apply). Many tax treaties limit Norway’s
ability to impose withholding tax on interest. A withholding tax will however, if implemented, take full
effect in relation to states which Norway does not have a tax treaty.

**_Our tax expenses may increase due to ongoing and future tax audits and certain potential_**
**_changes in current taxation rules._**

We operate in 25 countries. The business, including the implementation of transactions between entities
within the Company, is conducted in accordance with our interpretation and understanding of current
tax legislation, tax treaties and other provisions, case law and claims from tax authorities. However,
there is a risk that our interpretation and application of mentioned tax rules, treaties and other
regulations and requirements have not been or will not continue to be completely accurate in all
respects. There is also a risk that the tax authorities in the countries concerned will issue decisions that
deviate from our interpretation. Changes in tax law or practice could result in financial losses or
increased expenses for the Company.

In relation to corporate income tax, the Company, as a multinational group with several types of
transactions occurring between legal entities in different jurisdictions, must comply with the OECD
requirements regarding transfer pricing and transfer pricing documentation, as well as with new
legislation being implemented as a result of the BEPS framework. BEPS refers to tax avoidance
strategies that exploit gaps and mismatches in tax rules to artificially shift profits to low or no-tax
locations. These rules may, in practice and under certain circumstances, result in double taxation of
income or in costs being non-deductible.

In relation to value-added tax (“VAT”), the application of, exemption from, or refund of VAT varies
according to both the jurisdiction in which the service is being provided and the nature of the service
itself. Financial services, including the portfolio investments component of the Company’s Portfolio
Investments service line, are treated in many jurisdictions as tax-exempt or out of scope for VAT
purposes. This may result in different interpretations regarding the possibility to recover input VAT
charged to the Company by external and internal suppliers. The treatment of VAT claims included in
receivables purchased from external parties also varies between the jurisdictions. For example, in the
Netherlands, a VAT receivable is incurred when purchasing overdue receivables. The VAT portion of
the receivable can be recovered from the tax authorities if it is not collected from the debtor. In Sweden,
the Supreme Court issued a judgment in December 2016 regarding a claim against a private individual
that had been acquired by a financial company. The claim had originally arisen through the sale of
goods to a company that was subsequently declared bankrupt, and where the private individual liable
for the claim had been a member of the board of directors. The Supreme Court held that the private
individual was not liable for the portion of the claim relating to VAT, since the company that originally
sold the goods had recovered the VAT from the Swedish Tax Agency. We are currently assessing the
judgment to consider whether this could have any impact on our portfolio investments operations.
Changes in fiscal regulations or the interpretation of tax laws, and any consequent VAT payments,
particularly given that a systematic error could cause a rapid build-up of large amounts, may have a
material adverse effect on our business.

**_Spanish tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for Spanish tax purposes, of all or a portion_**
**_of the interest on our indebtedness, thus it may reduce the cash flow available to service our_**
**_indebtedness._**

Like many jurisdictions where we operate, Spanish Corporate Income Tax Law also contains a general
limitation on the deductibility of certain net financial expenses incurred by a Spanish Corporate Income
taxpayer (or by a Corporate Income Tax consolidated group to which such entity belongs) exceeding
30% of its annual operating profit (defined as EBITDA subject to certain adjustments), with €1 million
being deductible in any case. Deductible interest after the application of the aforementioned limitations
will be referred hereto as the “Maximum Deductible Amount.” The apportionment of non-deducted
interest in a given fiscal year, may be deducted in the following fiscal years, subject to the Maximum
Deductible Amount in each subsequent fiscal year. If the amount of net financial expenses in a given
fiscal year is below the Maximum Deductible Amount, the difference between the net financial expenses
deducted in that year and the Maximum Deductible Amount may increase such Maximum Deductible
Amount in the immediate subsequent five years.

We have financed several acquisitions of companies and portfolios in Spain with internal group loans.
In these situations the debt capacity is always considered and non-deductible interests costs from one
year are typically carried forward and used in later years, if applicable.

The impact of the above rules on our ability to deduct interest paid on indebtedness could increase our
tax burden and therefore negatively impact our cash-flows, financial condition and operating results
and, potentially, our ability to serve our indebtedness.

**_We may experience volatility in our reported financial results due to the revaluation of our_**
**_purchased portfolios and the timing of portfolio purchases during the financial year._**

Our purchased portfolios are recorded at purchase cost at the time of their purchase and thereafter held
at amortized cost through profit and loss. The performance of our portfolios is tested regularly. Any
revaluation is charged through the profit and loss account as an adjustment to revenues. Accordingly,
the value of our purchased portfolios as recorded on our statement of financial position and our
revenues in our income statement may fluctuate each time management reassesses forecasted cash
flows.

Our forecasted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions. Forecasts are generated by applying
historically observed decay rates to the actual gross collections achieved in recent months and also
accounting for macroeconomic conditions and operational improvements, among other things. These
historically observed decay rates are linked to the underlying collection fundamentals applicable at the
time, including, among others, general economic conditions, the collections strategy, collections
legislation and customer behavior. Any changes to these assumptions could result in revaluations which
change the value of the portfolios on our consolidated statement of financial position and lead to the

48


-----

inclusion of a revaluation in our consolidated profit and loss account. While revaluations are non-cash
movements, they are derived from the actual collections achieved in each individual portfolio and so
affect revenue and cost of sales as a percentage of revenue. This subsequently impacts other profit
and loss account line items, including gross profit, operating profit and the amount of tax on ordinary
activities and can also impact our cash outflows for tax payments.

There is generally a gap between the point in time when we purchase a portfolio and the point in time
when we begin earning returns on the purchased portfolio as we do not always have control over when
an agreement to purchase a portfolio will come into force and we need to locate customers, build a
consolidated profile of each such customer’s circumstances and formulate an appropriate repayment
solution before we can start to collect on a purchased portfolio. As a result, we may experience uneven
cash flows and delays in generating income from purchased portfolios. Any of the foregoing factors
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We may be forced to sell portfolio investments at prices below those we initially paid for them._**

We may be forced to sell our portfolio investments at levels that will not provide us with sufficient
compensation for the price we initially paid, for example to provide short-term liquidity or other funding
requirements, due to regulatory requirements or otherwise. This may prevent us from reinvesting in
portfolio investments that will provide sufficiently attractive returns to compensate for any shortfall,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_The need to adapt to debtors’ changing circumstances or circumstances impacting debtors may_**
**_result in increased collection activity costs, reduced cash flow or imprecise forecasts._**

If there are adverse changes in the financial circumstances of our debtors after we have acquired their
accounts, including as a result of any reduction in debtors’ income or in government benefits received
by debtors or indirectly as a result of further general deterioration in the macroeconomic environment,
this could lead to reduced collections, increase collection costs and reduce portfolio returns. Such
reduced collections could negatively affect our ERC, while higher collection costs and lower portfolio
returns would impact our results of operations and cash flows. Our forecast for future collections may
be rendered less reliable if the quantity and identity of debtors who may reduce their debt payments, or
the amounts of such reductions, cannot be accurately predicted. If actual collections with respect to
debt portfolios are significantly lower than our own projections when we purchased such portfolios, our
business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

**_Our collections may decrease or the timing of collections may be delayed if the number of_**
**_consumers becoming subject to personal insolvency procedures increases._**

We recover on claims that may become subject to insolvency procedures under applicable laws and
we also purchase portfolios containing claims that are currently subject to insolvency proceedings.
Various economic trends and potential changes to existing legislation may contribute to an increase in
the number of consumers subject to personal insolvency procedures. Under some insolvency
procedures, a person’s assets may be sold to repay creditors. While we have recently increased our
focus on secured NPLs so that we may be in a position to collect on such portfolios under insolvency
procedures, the majority of portfolios that we service are unsecured meaning we are generally unable
to collect on such portfolios under insolvency procedures involving the sale of a person’s assets.
Therefore, our ability to successfully collect on portfolios may decline or the timing on when we collect
on portfolios may be delayed if there is an increase in personal insolvency procedures, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We may be unable to obtain account documents for some of the accounts that we purchase or_**
**_we may purchase portfolios that contain accounts that are not eligible to be collected and this_**
**_may affect our ability to operate the portfolio according to the business plan envisaged when_**
**_purchasing the portfolio._**

When we commence enforcement actions through legal proceedings, courts may require a copy of the
account statements or applications to be attached to the pleadings in order to obtain a judgment against
a particular customer. Where we are unable to produce account documents in response to a customer’s
request, that account would be legally unenforceable. Furthermore, if any of the account documents we
do have were found to be legally unenforceable, courts may deny our claims. Any changes to laws,

49


-----

regulations or rules that affect the manner in which we initiate enforcement proceedings, including rules
affecting documentation, could result in increased administration costs or limit the availability of litigation
as a collection tool, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of
operations. Additionally, our ability to collect by means other than legal proceedings may be impacted
by laws that require that certain types of account documentation be in our possession prior to the
institution of any collection activities.

In the normal course of our debt portfolio purchases, and in the management of any forward flow
agreements that we may enter into from time to time, some individual accounts may be included in the
portfolios that fail to conform to the terms of the purchase contracts, or the legal existence of the debt
may be in doubt due to lack of documentation either at the time the debt was incurred or at discharge.
Accounts that would be eligible for recourse if discovered in a timely fashion, but that we do not discover
in time for such recourse, are likely to yield no return.

If we purchase debt portfolios containing too many accounts that do not conform to the terms of the
purchase contracts or contain accounts that are otherwise uncontrollable or unenforceable, we may be
unable to recover a sufficient amount, or anything at all, and such a portfolio purchase could be
unprofitable. This could lead to adverse accounting and financial consequences, such as the need to
make substantial provisions against the acquired assets or write down acquired assets.

Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, financial returns and
results of operations.

**_We are exposed to the risk of currency fluctuations._**

We have local operations in 25 countries.

The results of operations and the financial position of our subsidiaries are reported in the relevant local
currencies and then translated into Swedish kronor at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our
consolidated financial statements, which are stated in Swedish kronor. For the year ended December
31, 2018, 94% of our revenue was reported by entities whose functional currencies were different than
Swedish kronor, primarily the euro and Norwegian krone, which accounted for 58% and 12%,
respectively, of our revenue in 2018.

The exchange rates between some of these currencies and the Swedish kronor and the euro,
respectively, in recent years have fluctuated significantly and our local currencies may in the future
fluctuate significantly. Consequently, to the extent that foreign exchange rate exposures are not hedged,
fluctuations in currencies may adversely affect our financial results in ways unrelated to our operations.

Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
or financial condition.

**_We may not be successful in achieving our strategic plan and 2020 ambitions._**

We may not be successful in developing and implementing our strategic plan and 2020 ambitions, which
include growing portfolio investments, growing Credit Management Services, enhancing digitalization
and data analytics, continuing and improving operational excellence and recognizing the anticipated
benefits of the Merger. See “Business—Our Strategies”.

If the development or implementation of such plans is not successful we may not produce the revenue,
margins, earnings or synergies that we need to be successful and to offset the impact of adverse
economic conditions that may exist currently or develop in the future. We may also face delays or
difficulties in implementing process and system improvements, which could adversely affect our ability
to successfully compete in the markets we serve. In addition, the costs associated with implementing
such plans may exceed anticipated amounts and we may not have sufficient financial resources to fund
all of the desired or necessary investments required in connection with our plans, including one-time
costs associated with our business consolidation and operating improvement plans.

As part of our growth strategy, we seek acquisition opportunities and invest significant resources in
making acquisition bids, which we may not win, or entering into partnership agreements. Even if we do
enter into binding acquisition or partnership agreements, the consummation of such acquisition or
partnership agreements may be subject to various conditions, including regulatory approvals, which

50


-----

may not be achieved. We may not recover allocated resources, costs or expenses associated with
failed bids, which could adversely impact our liquidity and cash flows. The existing and future execution
of our strategic and operating plans will, to some extent, also be dependent on external factors that we
cannot control such as legislative changes, systemic failures in our industry or the industry sectors of
our clients and changes in fiscal and monetary policies. In addition, these strategic and operational
plans need to be continually reassessed to meet the challenges and needs of our businesses in order
for us to remain competitive. The failure to implement and execute our strategic and operating plans in
a timely manner or at all, to realize the cost savings or other benefits or improvements associated with
such plans, to have the financial resources necessary to fund the costs associated with such plans or
incur costs in excess of anticipated amounts or to sufficiently assess and reassess these plans could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Our purchasing patterns and the seasonality of our business may lead to volatility in our cash_**
**_flow._**

Our business depends on the ability to collect on our debt portfolios and purchase portfolios of debt.
Debt collection is highly affected by seasonal factors, including the number of work days in a given
month, the propensity of customers to take holidays at particular times of the year and annual cycles in
disposable income. Accordingly, collections within portfolios tend to have high seasonal variances,
while our costs are more evenly spread out over the year, resulting in high variances of margins and
profitability between quarters. Furthermore, our debt portfolio purchases are likely to be uneven during
the year due to fluctuating supply and demand within the market. The combination of seasonal
collections and costs and uneven purchases may result in low cash flow at a time when attractive debt
portfolios become available. There can be no assurances that in the future we will be able to obtain
interim funding from our shareholders, by making other borrowings or by partnering with co-investors
or co-venture partners. A lack of cash flow could prevent us from purchasing otherwise desirable debt
portfolios or prevent us from meeting our obligations under any forward flow agreements we may enter,
either of which could materially and adversely affect our business.

**_Our risk management procedures may fail to identify or anticipate future risks._**

We continually review our risk management policies and procedures and will continue to do so in the
future. Although we believe that our risk management procedures are adequate, many of our methods
of managing risk and exposures are based upon observed historical market behavior and statisticbased historical models. As a result, these methods may not accurately predict future exposures, which
could be significantly greater than historical measures indicate. Other risk management methods
depend on the evaluation of information regarding markets, debt originators, debt collection agencies,
customers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible to us. In certain countries,
we rely on intermediaries such as debt collection agencies and we may be held liable for the acts of
intermediaries if we cannot demonstrate that we have adequate procedures in place to prevent risks
such as bribery. For example, debt originators typically require us to assume responsibility for the acts
of their respective third-party intermediaries in relation to ongoing compliance matters. Further, we keep
track of employee misconduct and have policies and procedures in place to minimize its impact, but
these procedures may not prove sufficient (for example, to avoid employee fraud). Failure (or the
perception that we have failed) to develop, implement, monitor and, when necessary, preemptively
upgrade our risk management policies and procedures could, at the very least, give rise to reputational
issues for both us and any associated debt originators and may result in breaches of contractual
obligations for which we may incur substantial losses and face removal from debt originators’
purchasing panels. Risks that we fail to anticipate or adequately address could have a material adverse
effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.

**_A significant amount of our book value consists of intangible assets that may not generate cash_**
**_in the event of a voluntary or involuntary sale._**

Our consolidated total assets as of June 30, 2019 were SEK 81,884 million, of which SEK 40,513 million
were intangible. Intangible assets primarily include IT systems, goodwill, customer relationships and
trade names. While we believe that the carrying values of our intangible assets are recoverable, you
should not assume that we would receive any cash from the voluntary or involuntary sale of these
intangible assets, particularly if we were not continuing as an operating business. Further, the Merger,
other recent acquisitions and any future acquisitions expose us to the risks associated with write-downs

51


-----

and impairments to goodwill. We encourage you to read the Issuer’s Financial Statements carefully as
they provide more detailed information about these intangible assets.

**Risks related to our financial profile**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and_**
**_prevent us from fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes. We may incur substantially_**
**_more debt in the future, including debt in connection with future acquisitions, which may make_**
**_it more difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate_**
**_our business._**

After the consummation of the Transactions, we will have a significant amount of outstanding debt with
substantial debt service requirements. As of June 30, 2019, and as adjusted to give effect to the
Transactions, the 2019 MTN Transactions, the July 2019 Transactions and the Backstop Revolving
Credit Facility, our total funded debt would have been SEK 46,108 million. See “Capitalization.” In
addition, the Revolving Credit Facility provides for borrowings up to an aggregate of €1,375 million, of
which €968 million (equivalent) was available for drawing as of June 30, 2019 after giving effect to the
Transactions, the 2019 MTN Transactions, the July 2019 Transactions and the Backstop Revolving
Credit Facility. The Backstop Revolving Credit Facility provides for borrowings up to an aggregate of
SEK 2,000 million (€190 million equivalent).

Our significant leverage could have important consequences for our business and operations and for
holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to:

- making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debts and
liabilities;

- increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic
and industry conditions;

- requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of
principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow

- to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures or other general corporate
purposes;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive
environment and the industry in which we operate;

- placing us at a disadvantage to our competitors, to the extent that they are not as highly leveraged;

- restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities;

- limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing; and

- making it difficult for us to comply with regulatory capital requirements.

In addition, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Although the Indenture will contain
restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions will be subject to a number of
significant qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, the amount of debt that could
be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. The terms of the Indenture will
permit us to incur future debt that may have substantially the same covenants as, or covenants that are
more restrictive than, those of the Indenture. Moreover, some of the debt we may incur in the future
could be structurally senior to the Notes or may be secured by collateral that does not secure the Notes.
In addition, the Indenture will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute debt under
those agreements. The incurrence of additional debt would increase the leverage-related risks
described in this Offering Memorandum.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
satisfy our debt obligations including the Notes. Our ability to make payments on and refinance our debt
and to fund acquisitions, working capital expenditures and other expenses will depend on our future
operating performance and ability to generate cash from operations. Our ability to generate cash from

52


-----

operations is subject, in large part, to general economic, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors
and other factors that are beyond our control. Therefore, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash
flow from operations or obtain enough capital to service our debt or to fund our future acquisitions or
other working capital expenditures. For a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity after giving effect to
the Transactions, see “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”_

**_Any inability to comply with the terms of our existing debt and to refinance any existing debt as_**
**_it comes due and payable or an increase in interest rate levels may have a negative effect on our_**
**_financial condition._**

As of June 30, 2019, as adjusted for the Transactions, the 2019 MTN Transactions, the July 2019
Transactions and the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility, and the application of the proceeds from the
offering of the Notes, our total funded debt would have been SEK 46,108 million under our various debt
arrangements. These arrangements require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow to service interest
and to make principal repayments. Furthermore, we are subject to certain restrictive covenants under
our debt arrangements, which may limit our ability to engage in other transactions or otherwise place
us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less debt. In addition, non-compliance
with the terms of our debt arrangements could have a negative effect on our business. Further, certain
of our debt arrangements are subject to floating interest rates and our finance cost will accordingly be
affected by an increase in interest rate levels. Any of these developments could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

**_We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future_**
**_operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities._**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the
Existing Notes Indentures, and the Intercreditor Agreement restrict, and, the Indenture will restrict,
among other things, our ability to:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

- pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock;

- make certain restricted payments (including dividends and distribution with respect to shares of the
Issuer) and investments;

- prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

- create or incur certain liens;

- impose restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or other payments to us;

- transfer, lease or sell assets;

- merge or consolidate with other entities;

- enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and

- amend certain documents.

All of these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants.” In addition, the Issuer’s other debt arrangements that will remain in place_
after the Transactions contain certain customary restrictions. See “Description of Other Indebtedness.”
The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital
needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest.

In addition, we are subject to the affirmative and negative covenants contained in the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement and the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. In particular, the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement and the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement require us to maintain
a specified financial ratio under certain circumstances. Our ability to meet this financial ratio can be
affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet them. A breach of

53


-----

any of those covenants, ratios or restrictions could result in an event of default under the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement and the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Upon the occurrence
of any event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Backstop Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement, subject to applicable cure periods and other limitations on acceleration or
enforcement, the relevant creditors could cancel the availability of the Revolving Credit Facility and the
Backstop Revolving Credit Facility and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Revolving
Credit Facility and the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility, together with accrued interest, immediately
due and payable. In addition, any default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the
Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement could lead to an event of default and acceleration under
other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the Existing
Notes Indenture and the Indenture. If our creditors, including the creditors under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement and the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, accelerate the payment of
those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be
sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be
due and payable and to make payments to enable the Issuer to repay the Notes, in full or in part. In
addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any collateral
granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to meet our obligations under our indebtedness, a_**
**_substantial amount of which will mature prior to the Notes, and to sustain our operations, which_**
**_we may not be able to generate or raise._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, a substantial amount
of which will mature prior to the Notes, and to fund our ongoing operations, will depend on our future
performance and our ability to generate cash, which is subject to general economic, financial,
competitive, legislative, legal, regulatory and other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors,” many of
which are beyond our control. Under the Intrum Existing MTN Program, as of June 30, 2019, SEK 1,000
million of Intrum Existing MTNs mature on July 6, 2020 and SEK 2,900 million, after giving effect to the
2019 MTN Transactions, of Intrum Existing MTNs, mature on July 3, 2023. The June 2017 Fixed Rate
Euro 2022 Notes mature on July 15, 2022. The June 2017 Fixed Rate Euro 2024 Notes mature on July
15, 2024. The Intrum Existing Private Placement Notes mature in June 2023. See “Description of Other
_Indebtedness.” At the maturity of the Notes or any other debt which we may incur, if we do not have_
sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund
our other liquidity needs, we may be required to refinance such indebtedness. Our ability to refinance
our indebtedness, on favorable terms, or at all, will depend in part on our financial condition at the time
of any contemplated refinancing. To the extent we are unable to access the capital, we may be forced
to modify our financing strategy or bear an unattractive additional cost of capital, including through
higher interest rates or more onerous financial and other covenants than our current indebtedness, or
other financing markets on acceptable terms, which could decrease our profitability and reduce our
financial and operational flexibility. If we are unable to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or
obtain such refinancing on terms acceptable to us, we may be forced to sell assets, or raise additional
equity financing in amounts that could be substantial. The type, timing and terms of any future financing
will depend on our cash needs and the then prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot
assure you that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness as it comes due on commercially
acceptable terms or at all and, in connection with the refinancing of our indebtedness, or otherwise, we
may seek additional refinancing, dispose of certain assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek
to raise additional capital. We cannot assure you that we will be able to accomplish any of these
measures in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of the
agreements governing our existing indebtedness, including, among others, the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Existing Notes Indentures and the
Indenture, may limit our ability to pursue any of these measures.

**_Certain of our debt instruments bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly,_**
**_increasing our interest expenses and reducing cash flows, and changes in any of the applicable_**
**_IBOR calculation processes may adversely affect our finance cost._**

A substantial portion of our indebtedness, the Intrum Existing MTNs and borrowings under the
Revolving Credit Facility and the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, will bear interest at per
_annum rates equal to applicable IBOR, adjusted periodically, plus a spread. These interest rates could_
rise significantly in the future, thereby increasing our interest expenses associated with these

54


-----

obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering the Issuer’s ability to
make payments on the Notes.

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, STIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other
types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing national
and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial
Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in
financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which
entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of
administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the
past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot
be predicted. Changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or
law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or STIBOR is
determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other
consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark. Any such change, as well as
manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in
reported EURIBOR or STIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that
bears interest at floating rates of interest.

**_Our hedging agreements may expose us to credit default risks and potential losses if our_**
**_hedging counterparties fall into bankruptcy._**

We are party to currency interest rate swaps and we may enter into additional interest hedging
agreements to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. We may also enter into foreign
currency hedging arrangements to hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Under any such
agreements, we are exposed to credit risks of our counterparties. If one or more of our counterparties
falls into bankruptcy, claims we have under the swap agreements or other hedging arrangements may
become worthless. In addition, in the event that we refinance our debt or otherwise terminate hedging
agreements, we may be required to make termination payments, which would result in a loss.

**Risks related to the Notes**

**_The Issuer is a holding company dependent upon cash flow from subsidiaries to meet its_**
**_obligations on the Notes._**

The Issuer is a holding company with no independent business operations or significant assets other
than investments in its subsidiaries. The Issuer depends upon the receipt of sufficient funds from its
subsidiaries to meet its obligations. We intend to provide funds to the Issuer in order to meet the
obligations on the Notes through a combination of dividends and interest payments on intercompany
loans. The obligations under intercompany loans will be junior obligations and will be subordinated in
right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer or the relevant subsidiary, including
obligations under, or guarantees of obligations under, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Backstop
Revolving Credit Facility.

The amounts of dividends and distributions available to the Issuer will depend on the profitability and
cash flow of its subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to issue dividends under applicable law.
The subsidiaries of the Issuer, however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable
law to, make distributions or advance upstream loans to the Issuer to make payments in respect of its
indebtedness, including the Notes. Various agreements governing our debt may restrict, and in some
cases, may actually prevent the ability of the subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group.
Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation.

**_Claims of the secured creditors of the Issuer, such as lenders under the Revolving Credit_**
**_Facility, the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility, the Intrum Existing Private Placement Notes and_**
**_certain hedging agreements will have priority with respect to their collateral over the claims of_**
**_unsecured creditors, such as the holders of the Notes, to the extent of the value of the assets_**
**_securing such indebtedness._**

The Notes will not be secured by any of the Issuer’s or its subsidiaries’ assets. In the event of any
foreclosure, dissolution, winding up, liquidation, reorganization, administration or other bankruptcy or
insolvency proceeding of the Issuer at a time when it has secured obligations, holders of secured

55


-----

indebtedness, including lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Backstop Revolving Credit
Facility, the Intrum Existing Private Placement Notes and certain hedging arrangements, will have
priority claims to the assets of the Issuer that constitute their collateral (other than to the extent such
assets in the future also secure the Notes on an equal and ratable or priority basis). The holders of the
Notes will participate ratably with all holders of the unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer, and potentially
with all its other general creditors, based upon the respective amounts owed to each holder or creditor,
in the remaining assets of the Issuer. The claims of holders of the Notes and other unsecured creditors
will also depend on whether there is any value left in the bankruptcy estate besides any secured assets.
If any of the secured indebtedness of the Issuer becomes due or the creditors thereunder proceed
against the operating assets that secure such indebtedness, our assets remaining after repayment of
that secured indebtedness may not be sufficient to repay all amounts owing in respect of the Notes. As
a result, holders of Notes may receive less, ratably, than holders of secured indebtedness of the Issuer
and may not be able to recover the full or any amount of their investment in the Notes. See “Description
_of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

As of June 30, 2019, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, the 2019 MTN Transactions, the
July 2019 Transactions and the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility, we would have had total funded
debt of SEK 46,108 million outstanding, including SEK 5,981 million of secured indebtedness
(representing amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Intrum Existing Private
Placement Notes and excluding hedging obligations). In addition, an additional €968 million is available
to be drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility and SEK 2,000 million (€190 million equivalent) under
the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Capitalization.”

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities and preference shares (if any) of our_**
**_subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes._**

Initially, none of our subsidiaries will guarantee or have any obligations to pay amounts due under the
Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Generally, claims of creditors of a subsidiary,
including lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Backstop Revolving Credit
Facility, certain hedge providers, trade creditors, and claims of preference shareholders (if any) of the
subsidiary will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the claims of
creditors of its parent entity, including, in the case of the Issuer, by holders of the Notes. In the event of
any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, administration or other bankruptcy
or insolvency proceeding of any of our subsidiaries, holders of their indebtedness and their trade
creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before
any assets are made available for distribution to its parent entity. The creditors of the Issuer (including
the holders of the Notes) will have no right to proceed against the assets of such subsidiary. As such,
the Notes will be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and preference
shareholders (if any) of our subsidiaries. The Indenture will provide that, in the event that the Intrum
Existing MTNs and certain Eligible MTN Replacement Indebtedness shall have been repaid in full, then,
subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer will be required to cause certain of its subsidiaries to guarantee
the Notes; however, this covenant will be subject to a number of exceptions and limitations including,
amongst others, if there are any existing contractual obligations that prohibit such guarantees. The
Intrum Existing Private Placement Notes and the Intrum Existing Commercial Paper Program currently
prohibit the provision of such guarantees and therefore the Issuer will not be under an obligation to
cause any of its subsidiaries to guarantee the Notes until such indebtedness is refinanced and such
refinancing indebtedness does not include a similar restriction. As a result, there can be no assurance
that such subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes in a timely manner after any such repayment, or at all,
and you should not rely on such potential guarantees as a basis of your investment decision. In the
event any subsidiaries of the Issuer guarantee the Notes in the future, such guarantee will be limited to
the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant guarantor, without rendering the relevant
guarantee voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable law or without resulting in a breach of any
applicable law, and enforcement of each guarantee would be subject to certain generally available
defenses. These laws and defenses include those that relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent
conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. See
“Description of the Notes— Certain covenants—Limitation on guarantees of indebtedness by restricted
_subsidiaries; future guarantors.”_

**_The Intercreditor Agreement provides that in certain circumstances payments in respect of the_**
**_Notes may be blocked._**

The Intercreditor Agreement will contain significant restrictions with respect to payments of the Notes.
Subject to certain limitations, if there is a payment default under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility, senior debt documents or the Indenture, or if a
senior payment stop notice is issued following a non-payment event of default under the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement, the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility, senior debt documents or the
Indenture, then payments under the Notes will not be permitted to be made unless the payment is
funded directly or indirectly with amounts which have not been received from the Issuer or its restricted
subsidiaries. In some circumstances, for instance where payments were received on the Notes in
breach of the Intercreditor Agreement, holders would be required to turn over such payments to the
Security Agent for redistribution. In addition, although the holders of the Notes are generally entitled to
enforce their claims against the Issuer pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, nevertheless the
Intercreditor Agreement places limits on enforcement to the extent it would prejudice the enforcement
by senior creditors of their security granted by the Issuer. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—
_Intercreditor Agreement.”_

**_The insolvency laws of Sweden and other jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the_**
**_U.S. bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on_**
**_the Notes._**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Sweden. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
event, proceedings could be initiated in Sweden or another relevant jurisdiction. The bankruptcy,
insolvency, administrative and other laws of Sweden may be materially different from, or in conflict with,
those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and
other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceeding. The application of
Swedish laws or laws of another relevant jurisdiction, or any conflict among them, could call into
question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce
your rights under the Notes in those jurisdictions, limit any amounts that you may receive or otherwise
result in a less favorable outcome.

**_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the_**
**_Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the_**
**_Indenture._**

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of control,” the Issuer would be required
to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal
amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. If a
change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at
such time to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement, the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Existing Notes
Indentures, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other existing contractual obligations would allow us to
make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in an event of default under,
acceleration of, or an obligation to mandatorily prepay the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the
Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes
pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control
itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow them to pay cash
to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of control, may be limited by our then
existing financial resources. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when the Issuer
is prohibited from repurchasing the Notes by the terms of its indebtedness (or the Issuer’s subsidiaries
are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes), we may
seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt
to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such consent to repay such borrowings is
not obtained or such refinancing is not possible, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any
Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase
the Notes upon a change of control. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such
financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the
Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the
Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Existing Notes Indentures and certain other
indebtedness. See “Description of the Notes—Change of control.”

57


-----

**_In certain circumstances, a Change of Control Offer will not be required to be made._**

The change of control provisions contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection
in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or
other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events
may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a
“Change of Control” as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of the Notes—
_Change of control,” the Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to_
repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization
or similar transaction.

The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all
of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although
there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise
established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there
may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all
or substantially all” of the Issuer’s and its restricted subsidiaries’ assets taken as a whole. As a result,
it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to
make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_If the Notes are redeemed early, an investor may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a_**
**_comparable security._**

In the event that the Notes are redeemed early in accordance with the optional redemption provisions
contained in the Indenture and depending on prevailing market conditions at the time, an investor who
receives proceeds due to such an early redemption may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a
comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as that carried by the Notes. See “Description
_of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”_

**_The transfer of the Notes is restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price at_**
**_which they may be sold._**

The Notes have not been registered under, and we are not obliged to register the Notes under, the U.S.
Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be
offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and any other applicable laws. See “Transfer Restrictions.” We
have not agreed to or otherwise undertaken to register the Notes and we do not have any intention to
do so.

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures_**
**_of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Unless and until the Notes are in definitive registered form, or definitive registered notes are issued in
exchange for book-entry interests (which may occur only in very limited circumstances), owners of bookentry interests will not be considered owners or holders of the Notes. The common depositary (or its
nominee) for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the global notes
representing the applicable Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in
respect of the relevant global notes representing the Notes will be made to Citibank, N.A., London
Branch as Principal Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter,
these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the global
notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment
by the Principal Paying Agent to Euroclear and Clearstream, we will have no responsibility or liability
for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests.
Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest in the Notes, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear
and Clearstream, and if you are not a participant in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, on the procedures
of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder
of the relevant Notes under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have any direct rights
to act upon any solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the
Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have

58


-----

received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear or Clearstream, or, if applicable, from a participant.
There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be
sufficient to enable you to vote on any matters or on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until the relevant
definitive registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry
interest, you will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. We cannot assure you that
the procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the
timely exercise of rights under the Notes. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the_**
**_Notes may be limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

- the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

- your ability to sell your Notes; or

- the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things,
prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the
market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial
volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes
may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to
disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different
investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for
the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a
holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no
assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops,
you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

An application has been made for the Notes to be listed on the Securities Official List of the Exchange,
though we cannot assure you that Notes will become or remain listed. Although no assurance is
made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the Notes being listed on the Securities
Official List of the Exchange, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an
alternative admission to listing on another stock exchange) of the Notes from the Exchange may have
a material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes in the secondary market.

In addition, the Indenture will allow us to issue additional notes in the future which could adversely
impact the liquidity of the Notes.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If investors measure their investment returns by
reference to a currency other than euro an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related
risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the values of the currency of the
applicable Notes relative to the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their
investments because of economic, political and other factors over which we have no control.
Depreciation of the currency of the applicable Notes against the currency by reference to which
investors measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the
Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the
Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which the investors measure the return on their
investments. Investments in the Notes by U.S. investors may also have important tax consequences as
a result of foreign exchange gains or losses, if any. See “Tax Considerations—Certain United States
_federal income tax considerations.”_

**_You may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer and its subsidiaries are organized outside the United States, and our business is conducted
entirely outside the United States. The directors, managers and/or executive officers of the Issuer are
59


-----

non-residents of the United States, and substantially all of their assets are located outside the United
States. Although the Issuer will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with
any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United
States on these directors, managers and executive officers. In addition, as substantially all of the assets
of the Issuer and its subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are located outside
of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against them.
Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer may not be
subject to the provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. The United States is not
currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other
than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with Sweden. There is, therefore, doubt
as to the enforceability in Sweden of U.S. securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in
such jurisdictions. In addition, the enforcement in Sweden of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court,
whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions.
There is also doubt that a court in Sweden would have the requisite power or authority to grant remedies
sought in an original action brought in such jurisdictions on the basis of U.S. securities laws violations.
See “Enforcement of Foreign Judgments and Service of Process.”

**_Judgements entered against Swedish entities in the courts of a state which is not subject to the_**
**_Brussels Regulations or the Lugano Convention may not be recognized or enforceable in_**
**_Sweden._**

A judgement entered against a company incorporated in Sweden, such as the Issuer, in the courts of a
state which is not, under the terms of (i) Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament
and of the Council of December 12, 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of
judgements in civil and commercial matters (the “2012 Brussels Regulation”), (ii) Council Regulation
(EC) No. 44/2001 of December 22, 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of
judgments in civil and commercial matters (the “2000 Brussels Regulation”) or (iii) the Convention on
jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgements in civil and commercial matters made
at Lugano on October 30, 2007 (the “Lugano Convention”), a Member State (as defined by the 2012
Brussels Regulation and the 2000 Brussels Regulation) or a Contracting State (as defined in the Lugano
Convention), would not be recognized or enforceable in Sweden as a matter of law without a retrial on
its merits (but will be of persuasive authority as a matter of evidence before the courts of law,
administrative tribunals or executive or other public authorities of Sweden). As a result, when the United
Kingdom leaves the EU, an English court judgement entered against the Issuer in relation to the Notes
may not be recognized or enforceable in Sweden (absent any replacement arrangements being put in
place).

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and_**
**_may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings
may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors
discussed herein and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a
recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal
by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for
any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit
rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or
withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating
agencies may adversely affect our access to capital, the cost and terms and conditions of our financings
and the value and trading of the Notes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Notes may be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

The Notes may be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If
the Notes are issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. investors in such Notes will
generally be required to include amounts representing OID in their gross income as it accrues in
advance of the receipt of cash payments attributable to such income using the constant yield method.
See “Tax Considerations—Certain United States federal income tax considerations.”

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The gross proceeds of the Offering will be approximately SEK 8,964 million (€850 million equivalent).
We intend to use the gross proceeds from the Offering to fund the Redemption and, with any net
proceeds in excess of amounts used to fund the Redemption, to repay drawings under the Revolving
Credit Facility. Fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions will be funded with cash on the
balance sheet. See “Summary—The Transactions.”

For descriptions of our anticipated indebtedness after giving effect to the Transactions, the 2019 MTN
Transactions and the July 2019 Transactions, see “Capitalization.”

The table below sets forth our estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the Transactions.
Actual amounts will vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including fluctuations
in currency exchange rates, the date of completion of the Redemption and differences between
estimated and actual fees and expenses.

**SELECTED HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA**

_The following section presents selected historical consolidated financial data of the Issuer as of the_
_dates and for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the sections entitled “Use of_
Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operation” as well as the Issuer’s Financial Statements. In November 2017, in connection with the
_Divestment, the Issuer agreed to divest certain subsidiaries to a company in the Lowell Group. The_
_Divestment completed on March 20, 2018. In the income statement for the years ended December 31,_
_2018 and 2017, and the six and twelve months ended June 30, 2018, the subsidiaries being divested_
_in accordance with the above have been reported as discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS_
_5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. In the balance sheet as of December_
_31, 2017, these subsidiaries are reported as assets and liabilities in operations held for sale. For further_
_information, see note 39 in the Issuer’s audited financial statements as of and for the years ended_
_December 31, 2018 and 2017 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

_We adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers from January 1, 2018 and IFRS 16_
_Leases from January 1, 2019. The Issuer’s audited financial statements as of and for the year ended_
_December 31, 2017 and unaudited financial statements as of and for the twelve months ended June_
_30, 2018 have not been restated to reflect the retrospective adoption of IFRS 15. Neither the Issuer’s_
_Audited Financial Statements nor the Issuer’s unaudited financial statements as of and for the six and_
_twelve months ended June 30, 2018 and the Issuer’s unaudited financial statements as of and for the_
_twelve months ended June 30, 2019 have been restated to reflect the retrospective adoption of IFRS_
_16. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information”, “Management Discussion and Analysis of_
Financial Condition” and note 1 to the Issuer’s audited financial statements as of and for the year ended

**MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND**
**RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

_The following is a discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the_
_Issuer. The discussion and analysis of the Issuer is based on its unaudited interim consolidated financial_
_statements as of and for the six and twelve months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 and its audited_
_consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, in each_
_case, prepared in accordance with IFRS._

_In November 2017, in connection with the Divestment, the Issuer agreed to divest certain subsidiaries_
_to a company in the Lowell Group. The Divestment completed on March 20, 2018. In the income_
_statement for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the six and twelve months ended_
_June 30, 2018, the subsidiaries being divested in accordance with the above have been reported as_
_discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued_
_Operations. In the balance sheet as of December 31, 2017, these subsidiaries are reported as assets_
_and liabilities in operations held for sale. For further information, see note 39 in the Issuer’s audited_
_financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 included elsewhere_
_in this Offering Memorandum._

_We adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers from January 1, 2018 and IFRS 16_
_Leases from January 1, 2019. The Issuer’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the_
_years ended December 31, 2017 and unaudited financial statements as of and for the twelve months_
_ended June 30, 2018 have not been restated to reflect the retrospective adoption of IFRS 15. Neither_
_the Issuer’s Audited Financial Statements, the Issuer’s unaudited financial statements as of and for the_
_six and twelve months ended June 30, 2018 and the Issuer’s unaudited financial statements as of and_
_for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 have been restated to reflect the retrospective adoption of_
_IFRS 16. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information”, “Management Discussion and Analysis_
_of Financial Condition” and note 1 to the Issuer’s audited financial statements as of and for the year_
_ended December 31, 2018 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum for additional information_
_regarding our adoption of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16._

_This section includes certain LTM Information for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018._
_This LTM Information has been calculated by adding the Issuer’s historical results for the six months_
_ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, to the Issuer’s historical results for the year ended_
_December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and subtracting the Issuer’s historical results for the six_
_months ended June, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The LTM Information has been prepared solely for_
_the purposes of this Offering Memorandum, is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial_
_reporting, has not been audited or reviewed and does not reflect the application of IFRS 15 or IFRS 16_
_over the entire period. It is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily representative of the_
_Issuer’s results of operations for any future period or its financial condition at any future date. To_
_facilitate comparison of the results of operations following the Merger, which occurred on June 27, 2017,_
_compares LTM Information for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 with June 30, 2018. Such a_
_comparison is not possible for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017._

_You should read this discussion in conjunction with the Issuer’s Financial Statements included_
_elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. A summary of the critical accounting estimates that have been_
_applied to the Issuer’s consolidated financial statements is set forth below in “—Significant factors_
_affecting comparability—Significant Accounting Policies.” You should also review the information in the_
_section “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.” This discussion also includes forward-looking_
_statements which, although based on assumptions that we consider reasonable, are subject to risks_
_and uncertainties which could cause actual events or conditions to differ materially from those_
_expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties we_
_face as a result of various factors, see “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.”_

**Overview**

We are the largest European credit management company, providing a complete service offering, by
revenue, EBITDA and ERC, with operations in 24 European countries. Based on internal estimates, we
believe we hold a leading position in a majority of those countries. We provide our clients with a
balanced and integrated mix of services across the entire credit management value chain, including
credit management services and financial services, building upon our longstanding commitment to fair

69


-----

collection. The economies of scale that we are able to leverage due to our size and our focus on
digitization and information analysis, combined with significant recent strategic transactions, has
allowed us to maintain our strategic focus on both growth and increased efficiency. Our entry in 2018
into a strategic partnership with Banca Intesa Sanpaolo established us as a leading player in late
payments in Italy, one of Europe’s most attractive markets, and our purchase of a real estate portfolio
from Ibercaja Banco SA (“Ibercaja”) along with our acquisition of Solvia Servicios Inmobiliaros
(“Solvia”), a leading supplier of real estate services in Spain, has cemented our leading position in
Spain in real estate servicing (“RES”), which involves servicing of loans related to properties and other
services related to the security/property owned by clients. In 2018, we also implemented our first minor
acquisition in Brazil, allowing us to further expand geographically and to explore the Brazilian market.

We provide two services to customers through our Credit Management Services (“CMS”) service line
and Portfolio Investments service line to ensure that companies that sell products, services or credit are
paid:

**_CMS service line. We employ tailored debt collection strategies and solutions to maximize cash flow_**
streams from loans and other overdue receivables for clients who have decided to outsource their debt
collection function. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, we generated net revenue of SEK
7,443 million (€712 million equivalent) from CMS, excluding revenue generated from portfolios of loans
and other overdue receivables that we own. We also provide leading capabilities in alternative solutions,
such as carve-outs, which involves taking over the in-house collection platform of financial institutions
clients and conducting debt collection on behalf of the financial institutions under a long-term contract
as well as RES.

In addition to, and generally in combination with, collection services, we provide clients with a wide
range of value-added services, prior to loans and receivables becoming overdue, including customer
and credit information and analysis on individuals and companies across Europe to help our clients
assess their potential customers’ payment capacity, data extraction and modelling, selection and
scoring of potential customers, and a full suite of services relating to accounts receivable, including
invoicing, reminders and account ledger services.

**_Portfolio Investments service line. We offer a range of portfolio investment financial services,_**
including relating to real estate acquisitions and debt servicing. In particular, we purchase portfolios of
secured and unsecured loans and other overdue receivables from our clients for a portion of the nominal
value, which we then service using our in-house debt collection function, with a few exceptions.
Following the purchase of the defaulted receivables, our long-term debt collection measures
commence, aimed at helping consumers become debt-free as we help them reduce their debt in a
respectful manner, for example through instalment plans that take account of each consumer’s payment
capacity. We also, either in the course of recovery activities for secured loans (or, infrequently, in
relation to unsecured loans with personal guarantees) or as a standalone investment strategy, directly
or indirectly and independently or alongside co-investors, hold title to real estate that we expect to
eventually resell. We arrange for the sale of such real estate using internal and external resources and
networks. Our real estate exposure is concentrated in Spain, Italy, Portugal and Hungary and, together
with properties held by joint ventures in which we participate along with our co-investors, totals
approximately 6,000 properties with a book value of €259 million as of June 30, 2019. For the twelve
months ended June 30, 2019, we generated revenue of SEK 6,790 million (€650 million equivalent)
from our Portfolio Investments service line. As of June 30, 2019, the ERC of our portfolios of loans and
overdue receivables was SEK 60,896 million (€5,768 million equivalent). As part of our Portfolio
Investments service line, we also provide factoring, payment guarantees and e-commerce services.

We believe that the combination of portfolio investments and debt collection has been and will continue
to be key to our success. Our range of services helps attract and retain clients and increases the breadth
and depth of collectible data, in turn supporting the creation of tailored collection strategies and
development of analytical capabilities to enable more accurate pricing of portfolios. Operating across
Europe and with a balanced business model also gives us investment optionality as we can allocate
resources across our platform and jurisdictions to the opportunities that we find most attractive. For the
twelve months ended June 30, 2019, our revenue was SEK 14,233 million (€1,362 million equivalent)
and _Pro Forma Cash EBITDA was SEK 10,370 million (€993 million equivalent). See “Summary_
_Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data.”_

**Key factors affecting results of operations**

Our business and results of operations, as well as the key operating metrics discussed below, have
been and are expected to continue to be affected by certain key factors including, in particular, (i) the
volume of clients outsourcing their credit optimization and collection requirements and the level of debt
available for purchase; (ii) purchases of debt portfolios at the right price; (iii) competition and pricing;
(iv) gross collection levels; (v) collection costs and operational efficiency; (vi) cost saving measures;
(vii) seasonality; (viii) acquisitions and geographic expansion; (ix) economic conditions; (x) foreign
currency effects and (xi) tax effects. Each of these factors is discussed in more detail below.

**_Volume of clients outsourcing their credit optimization and collection requirements and the level_**
**_of debt available for purchase_**

Providing an integrated service offering throughout the credit management chain is key to attracting
and retaining clients. We believe that onboarding clients at the outset of their transaction processes
through the provision of credit optimization and collection services has been crucial to our success. Our
results of operations are linked to the volume of companies seeking to outsource their credit-related
offerings as well as to the overall level of loans and other overdue receivables available for purchase
and for third-party collection in the markets and industry sectors in which we operate. During the periods
under review, the volume of credit optimization and collection services that we provide and the volume
of loans and other overdue receivables sold has increased. We believe that this trend will continue due
to three main factors: (i) an increasing consumer expectation that businesses will offer alternatives to
direct, one-off payments and as a result an increasing number of businesses seeking to offer alternative
payment methods in order to remain competitive in their respective markets; (ii) an increased propensity
to sell NPLs and other overdue receivables as a result of regulatory pressures on businesses to
deleverage, combined with businesses’ desire for improved and predictable cash flows; and (iii) an
increase in the number of businesses outsourcing credit optimization and collection services and selling
debt in order to focus on their core operations, creating a growing sophistication gap in debt collection
capabilities when compared with the competencies of credit management providers. During the periods
under review, we benefited from these trends and were able to expand operations and improve our
results of operations.

**_Making portfolio investments at the right price_**

Our ability to purchase portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables at the right price has been and
will continue to be a key driver of our results of operations. Our portfolio investments consist mainly of
portfolios of loans, real estate portfolios and other overdue receivables purchased at prices significantly
below the nominal total collectible value on the portfolios and are recognized at amortized cost. We
expect to achieve collections in excess of the portfolio purchase price and as of June 30, 2019 our ERC
was 1.8 times the book value of our portfolio investments. As of June 30, 2019, our book value of
portfolio investments (including joint ventures and real estate) was approximately SEK 32 billion, which
exceeds our previously announced ambition of SEK 30 billion for the year ended 2020.

When purchasing portfolios, we engage in an extensive valuation of the portfolio in order to determine
the optimal price to offer the client. See “Business—Operations and service offerings—Portfolio
_Investments service line—Purchase of overdue receivables.” Our investment criteria for real estate_
portfolios differs from that of our loan and overdue receivables criteria due to the unique aspects of the
real estate market, including valuations of the underlying assets and collateral, our risk exposure to
price and value fluctuations in applicable real estate markets and the unique legislative and enforcement
regimes applicable to real property. Our performance is dependent on our ability to purchase portfolios
of loans, real estate portfolios and other overdue receivables that meet our investment criteria and that
generate an appropriate return on our portfolio investments.

After purchasing a portfolio, our performance is further dependent on our ability to generate gross
collection levels at or in excess of expectations for the specific portfolio. For the six months ended June
30, 2019 and 2018, our average collection of forecast was 107% and 109%, respectively. For the twelve
months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, our average collection of forecast was 108% and 111%,
respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 our average collection of forecast was
112% and 109%, respectively. During the periods under review, we also expanded the scope of our
investments within new asset classes, primarily in secured claims and RES. For example, in October
2016 we acquired a large portfolio from Erste Bank of Hungary, consisting of consumer NPLs secured

71


-----

by real estate. In December 2018, we reached an agreement to purchase 6,400 REOs in Spain from
Ibercaja Banco SA, holding the REOs in a new company of which we were initially an 80% shareholder
and from which in the first quarter of 2019 we divested half of our shares in the holding company to a
co-investor. In the second quarter of 2019 we also acquired Solvia, which offers real estate
management services in the Spanish market. Secured claims entail additional complexity with respect
to pricing and forecasting due to different risk and collection profiles when compared to the unsecured
loans and receivables that have historically been our main focus. As of June 30, 2019, 8% of the book
value of our portfolio investments consisted of secured loans.

In 2008 and 2009, the global financial crisis reduced the propensity of debt originators to sell overdue
receivables as prices decreased and also made it more difficult for debt purchasers to obtain funding
for portfolio investments. During this period, collection levels on certain portfolios decreased in some
countries thereby reducing overall portfolio performance. This impacted not only the pricing of new
portfolios, but also the valuation of existing portfolios which were typically secured under existing
funding arrangements. We were partly shielded from these challenging market conditions due to our
balanced offering, in particular our debt collection services. Our full service business model allowed us
to adapt our business mix and meet client demand. In contrast, pure debt purchasers that lacked
in-house debt collection operations were unable to adapt in this manner. Similarly, when the global
market started to recover in 2010 and pricing levels became increasingly attractive for sellers, we were
able to respond rapidly by increasing portfolio purchases. We believe that our balanced business model
allows us to adapt to a changing market environment and the fluctuations of supply and demand.

During the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, we invested SEK 10,809 million to purchase portfolios
of loans and other overdue receivables, including deliveries under forward flow agreements, with an
aggregate total collectible value of SEK 3,099 million. As of December 31, 2018, we had ERC of SEK
57,382 million, and as of June 30, 2019 we had ERC of SEK 60,896 million. As of December 31, 2018,
the portfolio investments book value in our consolidated statement of financial position was SEK 24,830
million and as of June 30, 2019, the portfolio investments book value in our consolidated statement of
financial position was SEK 26,228 million.

The majority of portfolios for sale are currently offered to the market through competitive tender
processes. There are two principal models for purchasing portfolios of loans and other overdue
receivables: (i) one-off agreements and (ii) forward flow agreements. In a one-off agreement, we
purchase a portfolio of claims in a single standalone transaction. In a forward flow agreement, we buy
claims from a client on an ongoing basis at a pre-defined price or price range for a given volume and
quality. Forward flow agreements are beneficial to our business because they offer a predictable and
certain flow of claims. Forward flow agreements are typically not long-term contracts and so do not
provide long-term assurance on purchasing levels. However, most of these contracts are with partners
with whom we have established relationships, and based on past experience we expect that many of
these contracts will be renewed. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we invested SEK
1,736 million and SEK 1,450 million in forward flow agreements and for the six months ended June 30,
2019 and 2018, we invested SEK 772 million and SEK 842 million, respectively, in forward flow
agreements.

Our ability to make portfolio investments is dependent on our internally generated funding resources
and access to adequate and attractive financing at the time portfolios become available for purchase.
We currently fund purchases of portfolios, working capital needs and other expenditures with cash
generated from operating activities, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility or additional bank
or capital markets debt. In certain cases, we also partner with co-investors to purchase portfolios, which
reduces our funding requirements proportionately to our economic interest in the given portfolios and
in some cases adds additional off-balance sheet leverage. Revenue and earnings derived from
co-investments are recognized based on proportionate participations in co-investment structures. See
“—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Off balance sheet arrangements.” We believe that we will continue
to be able to generate funding resources and obtain financing subject to market conditions. See “—
_Liquidity and capital resources” for additional information on funding of our portfolio purchases and “—_
_Key factors affecting results of operations—Economic conditions” for additional information on the_
effects of economic conditions on our business and results of operations.

**_Competition and pricing_**

Competition and pricing levels in the markets in which we operate affect our ability to successfully and
profitably offer credit optimization, payment, collection and financial services. The European credit
management market is fragmented and consists of several thousand companies with varied profiles.
The pricing element of portfolio investment and debt collection services is highly competitive across all
markets, resulting in increased pricing levels for purchases and decreased pricing levels for the
provision of debt collection services during the periods under review. We believe that in recent years
there has been a trend towards increased concentration of the credit management industry with large,
incumbent credit management companies expanding in scale as core clients, in particular financial
institutions, have placed increasing value on high-quality data assets acquired over an extended period
of time, robust compliance frameworks, multinational presence and long-term relationships with credit
management companies. In addition, reputation and ethical behavior are important competitive
advantages in order to maintain relationships with current and potential clients, especially financial
institutions.

The 2008 global financial crisis led to unattractive pricing levels for purchases of portfolios in 2008 and
2009, mainly as a result of the reduced ability of customers to repay their debt, lower supply as debt
originators became reluctant to sell overdue receivables at the lower valuations and difficulties in
obtaining financing for the purchase of portfolios. Markets started to recover in 2010 and pricing levels
have generally been advantageous during the periods under review. Unlike competitors that may not
offer debt collection services, our balanced operations provide an efficient tool in competitive
landscapes. As we are able to generate steady revenue and cash flow from our credit optimization,
payment and collection services, we can be selective about which portfolios to bid for as we do not
need to purchase portfolios that may be unattractively priced simply to ensure sufficient cash flow for
our operations. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to our industry and business—We are active in
_competitive markets and may be unable to continue to successfully compete with businesses that may_
_offer more attractive prices or benefit from less expensive funding or pursue lower return requirements_
_than us.”_

**_Gross collection levels_**

We have a large and diverse collection of portfolios that have delivered consistent and stable revenue
over time. We primarily generate revenue from: (i) fees received for credit information and payment
services; (ii) fees and commissions received from claims on which we perform debt collection services
pursuant to contracts that typically contain “no cure no pay” payment terms (meaning that we are paid
only if we are able to successfully collect on a claim); and (iii) payments received from customers linked
to claims in our portfolio investments. The ability and willingness of a customer to pay depends on
several factors, including employment status, the availability of funds and asset ownership. We believe
that our business benefits from both the quality of the data that we build about a customer’s
circumstances as well as the analysis we are able to perform on customer data to assess ability and
willingness to pay and, ultimately, to determine the best collections strategy for each customer.

_Gross collection levels on CMS_

The volume of loans and other overdue receivables which clients outsource to us and, consequently,
our revenue from debt collection services, is linked to our relationships with our debt collection clients
and our ability to demonstrate strong gross collection levels. Different types of asset classes and
different jurisdictions have different collection profiles and contract types. We offer flexible pricing
arrangements to our debt collection clients that are tailored to the client’s specific circumstances and
business needs as well as the relevant claims. The strength of our CMS service line pricing and claims
collection capabilities is evidenced by the master servicing agreements pursuant to which we provide
collection services on client’s loans and other overdue receivables. We believe that the benefits of our
claims collection strategy are evident through our many long-standing client relationships in which we
are seen as a trusted, important and strategic business partner. For more information about our debt
collection services, see “—Key operating metrics for CMS.”

_Gross collection levels on portfolio investments_

As of June 30, 2019, our ERC was SEK 60,896 million. We purchase debt portfolios at significant
discount to the total collectible value on portfolio investments and typically collect multiples of the

73


-----

purchase price. After we purchase a portfolio, we typically manage collection on that portfolio in-house.
Revenue generated from claims in our purchased portfolios is directly impacted by the gross collection
levels that we are able to achieve. As we keep all funds collected on purchased portfolios, we are able
to strategically allocate additional resources and costs to optimize collection and increase collection
levels on a given portfolio until it reaches the stage when the resources and costs required exceed
expected revenue. We believe that our ability to convert non-paying claims into paying claims on our
purchased portfolios illustrates the high degree of accuracy of our data assets and analytic capabilities
and the effectiveness of our scalable, multi-channel collections approach. We further believe that we
operate our forecasts with an appropriate balance between prudent pricing and strong collection
performance. From January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2019, on a quarterly basis we collected 105-115%
of our cash flow forecasts. For a description of how we manage and track the performance of our
portfolios, see “—Revaluation of portfolio investments.”

**_Collection costs and operational efficiency_**

Optimizing customer contact at each stage of the collection life cycle is key to our debt collection
strategy. Much of our debt collection process is standardized and automated in order to maximize the
total amount collected over the life of the debt through sustainable payment plans or affordable
settlements achieved through an amicable and solution-oriented collection approach rather than
exploiting short-term collection potential. In Portfolio Investments, we benefit from any additional
revenue resulting from additional resources allocated to the collection on a portfolio. In CMS, the client
may need to accept a higher commission to Intrum in order for us to benefit from the additional
resources allocated to the collection. Debt purchasing does not require the client to take this risk, but
the client can realize some of the benefit by receiving an attractive price level.

The table below sets forth our collection cost ratio for the periods under review.

-----

Our collection cost ratio in the Portfolio Investments service line has been stable at 29% for the years
ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018. It increased to 30% for the twelve months ended
June 30, 2019 impacted partially by the temporary full consolidation of the REO portfolio acquired from
Ibercaja in December 2018, during which the acquisition cost of real estate disposed of in the period is
recognized in the service line cost to collect. Collection cost ratio is also impacted by the varying
characteristics of the portfolios we purchase and the timing of portfolio purchases throughout the year.
Specifically, we believe that recent trends in our collection cost ratio in the Portfolio Investments service
line have been driven by lower average blended ages of portfolios due to large uptakes in portfolio
investments. Costs are typically highest when portfolios are new as the higher initial collection costs
exert upward pressure on costs to collect without immediate accompanying increases in gross
collections. In addition, a large portion of recent portfolio purchases have come from financial institutions
and have higher average collectible values, meaning that the total amount of cash collected per case
increases even if the margin is slightly lower.

Margins in our CMS operations have declined slightly in the first half of 2019 due to challenges in Spain
and Italy. Our performance in Spain has been negatively affected by the loss and maturing of high
margin business process outsourcing contracts, for which we have been partly compensated. We
continue to focus on further improving the cost base of our Spanish operations and we expect the
completion of the Solvia acquisition to result in additional volume increases. Our Italian operations are
performing ahead of internal expectations, though during the ramp-up phase of our Italian operations
the distribution of earnings between CMS and portfolio investment has been skewed toward portfolio
investments, which has negatively impacted our CMS margin. We expect the distortion to be addressed
as the year progresses.

The group EBIT-margin increased from 31% in the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 to 33% in the
twelve months ended June 30, 2019, positively impacted by the contribution from participation in JVs.
Excluding such contribution, the EBIT-margin declined from 30% to 27%, negatively impacted by the
temporary increase in cost to collect from the full consolidation of Ibercaja and the loss and maturing of
high margin contracts in Spain and Italy.

Operational efficiency is key to our business model and a primary advantage of our business compared
to competitors as well as financial institutions and other customer companies who handle their debt
collection in-house. In the initial stages of the debt collection process, we estimate the creditworthiness
of a group of consumers based on historical data and anticipate their payment habits and behaviors, a
process that we refer to as “Scoring.” Scoring allows us to predict the likelihood that a customer will pay
its debts and to tailor our debt collection strategies in order to efficiently collect final payments from
end-customers. The process is tailored to account for specific circumstances and behaviors and also
to minimize the impact on the customer relationship. For more information on our Scoring process, see
“Business—Operations and service offerings—CMS—Collection services.” We thereafter determine
which collection method to use for the specific claim, such as calls, letters, text messages, emails or
personal visits by agents, depending on various factors including the geographic market, claim size,
client on whose behalf we are acting, applicable laws and regulations, reputational concerns and the
individual customer. We believe that our large scale and automated processes, complemented by our
data assets and analytic capabilities, allows us to optimize collection costs and uniquely tailor debt
collection strategies based on past experience. As a result, we believe that we are able to optimize
collection efficiency over the lifetime of the claim.

**_Seasonality_**

The timing of our purchases of portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables is likely to be uneven
throughout a financial year and from year to year due to fluctuating supply and demand within the
market, which has an impact on leverage and earnings. Measured by purchase price, we have generally
purchased more portfolios in the fourth quarter when debt originators in general, and financial
institutions in particular, often seek to sell assets. In the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017,
46% and 39%, respectively, of the portfolios that we purchased were purchased in the fourth quarter.
However, there may be exceptions to this trend. Our interim results may also be impacted by the timing
of the closing of a specific portfolio purchase and/or seasonal factors, such as whether Easter occurs
in the first or second quarter of the year. The seasonality described above impacts the returns generated
through debt collections on our purchased portfolios, and the amortization of such portfolios, and are
recognized in our consolidated income statement as described in more detail in “—Recognition of

75


-----

_purchased portfolios, revenue recognition, estimation of cash flow forecasts and revaluation of_
_purchased portfolios.”_

Our debt collection is also affected by seasonal factors relating to customers, including the number of
work days in a given month, the propensity of customers to take holidays at particular times of the year
and annual cycles in disposable income. Collections within specific portfolios may have high seasonal
variances while our costs are more evenly spread out over the year, which may result in high variances
of margins and profitability between quarters. Our margins are generally lower in the first quarter,
whereas collections are generally higher in the second and fourth quarters, due to customers’ receipt
of tax refunds, holiday bonus payments and other factors.

**_Acquisitions, geographic expansion and divestments_**

We have a strong track record of expanding both organically and through acquisitions. We have been
able to successfully integrate new businesses into our existing operations, achieve strategic plans,
capitalize on synergies and leverage our strong client relationships to acquire assets from some of the
largest telecommunications, utilities, banking and retail companies in Europe. These acquisitions have
allowed us to enhance our business intelligence capabilities, collection local knowledge and generate
steady streams of revenue.

From January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2019, our significant acquisitions include:

- In June 2019, we announced our entry into a long-term strategic partnership with Piraeus Bank,
under which we agreed to acquire 80% of Piraeus Bank’s Recovery Banking Unit in combination
with a long-term non-performing exposures serving agreement, establishing a strategic partnership
in the Greek NPL servicing market.

- In April 2019, we acquired, from Banco Sabadell, 80% of the bank’s wholly owned subsidiary Solvia
Servicios Inmobilarios, which offers real estate management services in the Spanish market.

- In December 2018, we entered into a partnership agreement with the Italian bank Banca Intesa
Sanpaolo, pursuant to which Banca Intesa Sanpaolo contributed its service platform for overdue
receivables, consisting of a collection department with a labor force of 600, and we contributed all
of our Italian operations at the time (other than Cross Factor SpA and the holding company Lindorff
Italy Srl). As a result of the agreement, we own a 51% interest in the shared Italian collection
business, Intrum Italy S.p.A., and therefore consolidate its results of operations, with the minority
share attributable to Banca Intesa Sanpaolo reported as a non-controlling interest. Intrum Italy
S.p.A. also entered into a 10-year exclusive servicing agreement with Intesa Sanpaolo for the vast
majority of the bank’s new NPL inflow during this period. As part of the partnership agreement,
Banca Intesa Sanpaolo contributed a portfolio of overdue receivables (mainly consisting of covered
loans) to a jointly-owned platform. Along with CarVal Investors, our co-investment partner, we own
51% of the jointly-owned platform, Penelope. We are subject to a shared controlling influence
agreement with CarVal Investors, and therefore report our interest in the jointly owned platform as
a participation in a joint venture.

- In December 2018, we reached an agreement to acquire 6,400 REOs in Spain from Ibercaja Banco
SA. The properties were transferred to a new company, of which we were initially an 80%
shareholder and Residential Murillo S.A., a subsidiary of Ibercaja Banco SA is a 20% shareholder.
In February 2019, we divested to a co-investor 50% of our shares in the company.

- In July 2018, we acquired a majority shareholding in the Brazilian credit management company
iPlatform, representing our entry into the Brazilian market.

- In December, 2017 we acquired the Italian company CAF S.p.A (“CAF”), the third-largest credit
management company for impaired unsecured receivables in Italy. In connection with the
acquisition of CAF, we acquired from the sellers a large, diversified unsecured receivables portfolio,
the collection on which is performed by CAF.

- In June 2017, we completed the Merger to become the largest European credit management
company, providing a complete service offering, by revenue, EBITDA and ERC. For further

76


-----

discussion of the divestment of assets as required by the European Commission in connection with
the Merger, see “—Divestments.”

- In April 2017, we acquired Top Factoring, one of the leading portfolio investment companies in
Romania which is mainly present in the bank and telecommunications sectors, with several strong
customer relationships generating recurring investment opportunities in portfolio investments.

- In April 2017, we acquired a minority shareholding in the French subsidiary IJCOF Corporate SAS,
which is active in credit management for customers with mainly corporate receivables.

- In February 2017, we acquired 1st Credit Limited, a medium sized UK company with operations in
debt purchasing. The name of 1[st] Credit has been changed to Intrum UK Ltd.

- In February 2017, we acquired Intractiv Wide Development SAS, a small credit management
business offering a digital platform for clients with corporate receivables in France.

- In October 2016, we acquired Segestión Gabinete Técnico Empresarial SL, a Spanish company
specializing in credit management for SMEs.

- In October 2016, we acquired Dansk Kreditorservice A/S (DKS), a Danish company specializing in
credit management for SMEs.

- In June 2016, we acquired a 93.66% interest in Aktua, which reduced to approximately 85% in July
2016, one of the leading credit management companies in the secured NPL segment in Spain,
significantly strengthening our secured consumer capabilities and adding RES capabilities to our
service offering.

- In April 2016, we acquired C&J Credit Services BVBA, a small Belgian credit management
company.

- In February 2016, we acquired Debitoren Services AG, a small Swiss company operating a
factoring business.

_Divestments_

In March 2018, we completed the Divestment, which comprised the sale of Lindorff’s operations in
Denmark, Estonia, Finland and Sweden as well as our historic operations in Norway to the Lowell
Group. The Divestment was a condition for the European Commission’s approval of the Merger. The
companies were sold for a purchase consideration of SEK 7,511 million. In the consolidated income
statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the six and twelve months ended
June 30, 2018, the subsidiaries that were divested were reported as discontinued operations in
accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. See note 39
to the Issuer’s audited financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017
included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

In October 2017, we sold the Dutch subsidiary Buckaroo BV to BlackFin Capital Partners.

In November 2017, we divested our shares in Arvada AB, formerly a joint venture between Intrum and
TF Bank, to TF Bank.

**_Economic conditions_**

The economic and market conditions in the countries in which we operate can have various effects on
our operations. For example, adverse economic conditions and increased levels of unemployment may
lead to higher default rates on claims, which may positively impact our ability to purchase portfolios with
attractive returns by increasing the stock of portfolios available for purchase. Similarly, negative
economic developments may increase the amount of loans and other overdue receivables held by our
debt collection clients, which may increase the number of claims that clients want to outsource to us for
collection. If adverse economic conditions materially reduce the ability of customers to enter into
transactions and/or repay their debts, our revenue from credit optimization services, debt collection
services and debt purchasing could decrease. Adverse economic conditions could also reduce some

77


-----

debt originators’ willingness to sell overdue receivables at the then prevailing market prices, which may
decrease the overall volume of portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables available for us to
purchase, or may pressure some debt originators to sell portfolios in order to free up capital, which may
increase the overall volume of loans and other overdue receivables available for us to purchase.
Following the 2008 global financial crisis, for example, the industry experienced dramatic slowdowns in
purchases of portfolios followed by increases in the sale of portfolios during subsequent periods as debt
originators sought to free up capital. Unfavorable economic conditions may also impact our ability to
obtain financing to purchase portfolios.

Improved economic conditions are likely to lower default rates on loans, which could negatively impact
the growth of the stock of portfolios available for us to purchase, as well as decrease the amount of
loans and other overdue receivables held by our debt collection clients, which could negatively impact
revenue generated through out debt collection services. Conversely, improved economic conditions
and decreased levels of unemployment: (i) imply that consumers will have higher income and a
corresponding increased ability to pay debt due on a timely basis, which could result in our experiencing
lower costs to collect; and (ii) are likely to drive higher consumption and encourage clients to offer
deferred payment to customers, which is likely to improve demand for our credit optimization services.

On June 23, 2016 the United Kingdom voted in a public referendum to leave the EU. On March 27,
2017, the U.K. government served notice under Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union (“Article
**50”) to formally initiate a withdrawal process. Under Article 50, the United Kingdom and the EU had a**
two-year period to negotiate the terms for withdrawal. Although the withdrawal date has been extended,
as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, there is no certainty as to the withdrawal process, and
none of a “no-deal Brexit”, a further extension of the period for negotiation of the United Kingdom’s
withdrawal or a second referendum in the United Kingdom can be ruled out. The withdrawal process
has created substantial political uncertainty within the EU, uncertainty in international financial markets
and reduced economic growth. The resulting political and economic uncertainty could also lead to a
departure, or heighten the risk of departure, from the Economic and Monetary Union of the EU by one
or more Eurozone countries and/or the abandonment of the euro as a currency. This heightened
uncertainty, and the consequences of a withdrawal, particularly in case of a “no-deal Brexit,” could have
a significant negative effect on consumer and market confidence. If the United Kingdom and the EU are
unable to negotiate acceptable withdrawal terms or if other EU member states pursue withdrawal,
barrier-free access between the United Kingdom and other EU member states or among the European
Economic Area overall could be diminished or eliminated. In light of the exposure that we have to the
EU and the euro through our euro-denominated borrowings, derivative instruments and cash flows, and
to the United Kingdom and the British pound sterling given our Intrum UK Limited (formerly 1[st] Credit
Limited) operations, any events adversely affecting the stability of the Eurozone or the United Kingdom
or the euro or the British pound sterling could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to our industry and business—
_The United Kingdom’s exit from the EU may adversely impact our business, results of operations and_
_financial condition.”_

**_Foreign currency effects_**

We currently have local operations in Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia,
Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Switzerland, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
Most of our subsidiaries transact business and report their financial results in currencies other than
Swedish kronor, our consolidated reporting currency. In addition, our existing indebtedness is primarily
denominated in euro and SEK, and the amounts incurred in euro and SEK do not necessarily match
the cash flows generated from operations in such currencies. Accordingly, our results of operations are
subject to currency effects, primarily currency translation exposure. We have historically hedged against
part of our translation exposure through currency hedging via external loans in foreign currency and
derivatives. Total net value of balance sheet hedge instruments amounted to SEK 61 million as of June
30, 2019.

The table below sets forth our actual revenue distribution by currency for the years ended December
31, 2018 and 2017 and the six months ended June 30, 2019, expressed in millions of SEK equivalent.

**_Tax effects_**

The statutory corporate tax rate in Sweden for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was 22%.
Our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was 23% and 22%,
respectively, with fluctuations primarily due to variations in the mix of taxable income among our
subsidiaries in jurisdictions with different tax rates. For additional information regarding income tax
expense, see Note 8 to the Issuer’s Audited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum.

**Significant factors affecting comparability**

**_The Merger and the Divestment_**

The Merger completed on June 27, 2017. As a result, the Issuer’s Financial Statements do not give
effect to the Merger until such date. The Divestment completed on March 20, 2018. In the income
statement for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the six and twelve months ended
June 30, 2018, the subsidiaries being divested in accordance with the above have been reported in
accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations as discontinued
operations. In the balance sheet as of December 31, 2017, these subsidiaries are reported as assets
and liabilities in operations held for sale. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.” For a
summary of certain other acquisitions and divestments during the periods under review, see “—Key
_factors affecting results of operations—Acquisitions, geographic expansion and divestments.”_

**_Significant accounting policies_**

We adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers from January 1, 2018 and IFRS 16
(Leases) from January 1, 2019. Neither our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2017 nor our unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the
twelve months ended June 30, 2018, have been restated to reflect the retrospective adoption of IFRS
15. None of the Issuer’s Audited Financial Statements nor our unaudited consolidated financial
statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2018 or the twelve months ended June 30,
2019 or June 30, 2018 have been restated to reflect the retrospective adoption of IFRS 16. The
introduction of IFRS 15 has not had a material impact on our earnings or financial position. The principal
effects of the application of IFRS 16 on the Issuer’s financial position and results of operations as of
and for the six months ended June 30, 2019 were that total assets increased by SEK 709 million (and
liabilities increased by a corresponding amount), with both an asset and a liability being reported for
leases in effect at any given time, and operating earnings improved by SEK 40 million through the
implicit interest expense in the leases being reported in net financial items rather than in operating
earnings. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information” and note 1 to the Issuer’s audited
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 included elsewhere
in this Offering Memorandum.

**Recent developments**

**_July 2019 Transactions_**

On July 31, 2019, we issued €800 million of 3.500% senior notes due 2026 (the “July 2019 Notes”)
under the indenture dated July 31, 2019 among, inter alios, the Issuer, as issuer, and Citibank, N.A.,
London Branch, as trustee (the “July 2019 Notes Indenture” and, together with the June 2017 Notes
Indenture, the “Existing Notes Indentures”). The proceeds from the issuance of the July 2019 Notes
were used to (i) redeem €300 million aggregate principal amount of senior floating rate notes due 2022
(the “June 2017 Floating Rate Euro Notes”) and SEK 3,000 million aggregate principal amount of
senior floating rate notes due 2022 (the “June 2017 Floating Rate SEK Notes” and, together with the
June 2017 Floating Rate Euro Notes, the “June 2017 Floating Rate Notes”) issued under the June
2017 Notes Indenture (the “July 2019 Transactions Redemption”); (ii) pay fees and expenses in
connection with the foregoing; and (iii) repay drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility. See
“Description of Other Indebtedness” (collectively, the “July 2019 Transactions”).

**_2019 MTN Transactions_**

In June 2019 we published, and the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority approved, an updated
prospectus for the Intrum Existing MTN Program, enabling us to issue bonds under a note programme
of up to SEK 5,000 million. As of June 30, 2019, we had an aggregate outstanding amount of SEK
1,000 million of Intrum Existing MTNs due 2020 that were issued on July 6, 2018. On July 3, 2019, we
completed an issuance of SEK 2,000 million of Intrum Existing MTNs due 2023, the proceeds of which
were used to repay drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility (the “July 2019 MTN Transactions”).
On August 22, 2019, we completed an additional issuance of SEK 900 million of Intrum Existing MTNs
due 2023, the proceeds of which were used to repay drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility (the
“August 2019 MTN Transactions” and, together with the July 2019 MTN Transactions, the “2019 MTN
**Transactions”).** The SEK 2,900 million of Intrum Existing MTNs due 2023 issued after June 30, 2019
are not reflected on our balance sheet as of June 30, 2019. As of June 30, 2019, after giving effect to
the 2019 MTN Transactions, we have an aggregate outstanding amount of Intrum Existing MTNs of
SEK 3,900 million.

**_Backstop Revolving Credit Facility_**

On July 18, 2019, we entered into a multicurrency revolving credit facility agreement with certain lenders
in order to provide a backstop facility for the Intrum Existing Commercial Paper Program and for general
corporate purposes. The total commitments under the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement,
including swingline commitments, are SEK 2,000 million (€190 million equivalent). It is a condition of
utilization of the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility commitments that at least 95% of the commitments
under the Revolving Credit Facility have been utilized.

**_Continued efficiency improvements program_**

As part of our efforts to further increase our operational efficiency, and building on the largely completed
merger synergies from the Merger, we are targeting €60 million in further efficiency improvements in
our bottom-line earnings in 2020 (on a run-rate basis). This will include activities such as fully integrating
Solvia into our existing operations and carefully prioritizing key projects within IT to ensure we benefit
from the size and scale of our organization. The costs to realize the program efficiency improvements
are anticipated to be equivalent to one year’s benefit.

Such run-rate operational efficiency improvement estimates (as well as costs related to implementing
such measures) are based on a number of assumptions made in reliance on the information available
to us and management’s judgments based on such information. The assumptions used in estimating
such operational efficiency improvements and related costs are inherently uncertain and are subject to
a variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those contained in any operational benefit estimates. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks related to our industry and business—Anticipated synergies from the Merger or_
_operational efficiency improvements from continued efficiency improvements programs may not_
_materialize.”_

**Recognition of purchased portfolios, revenue recognition, accounting treatment of associated**
**companies and joint ventures, estimation of cash flow forecasts and revaluation of purchased**
**portfolios**

The following sections describe how the IFRS accounting under the amortized cost methodology
recognizes the portfolio investments book value in our consolidated statement of financial position and
the returns generated through debt collections on such portfolios in our consolidated income statement.
These IFRS measures are derived from a number of other measures that are not defined in IFRS and
which involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity, including EIR and ERC, and these are areas
where assumptions and estimates are significant to the Issuer’s Audited Financial Statements.

**_Recognition of portfolio investments_**

Portfolio investments consist of portfolios of delinquent consumer debt purchased at prices significantly
below the nominal receivable. With effect from January 1, 2018, in accordance with the rules for loans
and receivables under IFRS 9, which replaced IAS 39 (or, for any annual periods prior to January 1,
2018, according to IAS 39), portfolio investments are recognized at amortized cost according to the
effective interest model. The new rules for portfolio investments require that we continue to report these
according to an EIR model, with minor adjustments in application. The primary change is that, in
accordance with IFRS 9, acquired credit-impaired receivables can be reported at a higher recognized
value than cost if our estimates of future cash flows change, which differs from our application of the
corresponding rules under IAS 39. The effect of this change is that earnings brought forward in the
opening balance for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by SEK 50 million after tax.
Comparative figures for previous years have not been recalculated.

Income from portfolio investments is recognized in the income statement as the collected amount less
amortization. The collection is often performed by the same personnel who handle collections and debt
surveillance on behalf of external clients within the CMS service line. The cost of collection is debited
internally at market price and expensed in the income statement for the Portfolio Investments service
line as a cost of services sold.

Reporting follows the effective interest method, where the carrying value of each portfolio corresponds
to the present value of all projected future cash flows discounted by an initial EIR determined on the
date the portfolio was acquired, based on the relation between purchase price cost and the projected
future cash flows on the acquisition date. Changes in the portfolio investments book value are
recognized as amortization for the period and included in the income statement on the revenue line.
Compensation received from debt originators due to rejected cases and price adjustments made to
purchased portfolios are recorded as an adjustment to the acquisition cost.

In connection with the purchase of each portfolio of receivables, a projection for a period of 180 months
is made of the portfolio’s cash flows. Cash flows include the loan amount, reminder fees, collection fees
and late interest that, based on a probability assessment, are expected to be received from debtors,
less forecast collection costs. With this forecast and the purchase price (including transaction costs) as
a basis, each portfolio is assigned an initial EIR that is then used to discount cash flows through the life
of the portfolio. Cash flow actual performance is compared against projections and monitored on a
monthly basis for all portfolios, although adjustments to projections are only made after the first year.
Projections are updated based on, among other things, achieved collection results, agreements
reached with debtors on installment plans and macroeconomic information. Cash flow projections are
made at the portfolio level, since each portfolio of receivables consists of a small number of
homogeneous amounts. On the basis of the updated cash flow projections and initial EIR, a new
carrying value for the portfolio is calculated in the closing accounts.

We apply internal application rules, which means that the initial EIR can be adjusted in certain cases
without a change in the carrying value of the portfolio for minor projection adjustments within a
predetermined interval. Changes over time in the portfolio investments book value can be divided into
a time and interest rate component (amortizations) and a component related to changes in estimates
of future cash flows (revaluations).

The effects of changes in cash flow forecasts are referred to as revaluations and treated symmetrically,
i.e., both increases and decreases in forecast flows affect a given portfolio’s portfolio investments book
value and, as a result, earnings. Prior to January 1, 2018, the portfolios were never recognized at higher

81


-----

than cost. Effective January 1, 2018, we have applied IFRS 9 with the result that portfolios may be
recognized at higher than cost if future cash flow forecasts change. Although selling portfolios of
portfolio investments is not included in our business model, when such sales do occur as an exception,
the resulting sales price received for the portfolio is reported in the same way as if it had been collected
from the debtors. The entire remaining carrying values of the portfolios are then recognized as
amortization.

From time to time, we also purchase portfolios on a forward flow basis. In a forward flow agreement,
we agree to buy claims from a client on an ongoing basis at a pre-defined price or price range for a
given volume and quality. Claims under forward flow agreements can be delivered on weekly, monthly
or quarterly basis and the EIR of these claims is calculated per batch delivered. Each delivery under a
forward flow agreement is treated as an individual portfolio purchase, using our own purchase cost and
our own EIR calculation.

**_Recognition of revenue from portfolio investments_**

Revenue on a portfolio investment is calculated as the total of the actual achieved gross collected
amounts of the portfolio during each month, less portfolio investment amortization and adjusted for
positive or negative portfolio investment revaluations. As a result of this methodology, revenue for a
portfolio will correspond closely to its carrying value multiplied by the EIR that would have been
determined if the calculation had been based on gross collections, adjusted for over- or
under-performance and for revaluations.

The table below sets forth an illustrative example of portfolio revenue recognition and changes in
portfolio investments book value according our methodology under IFRS.

Memorandum.

(4) Inter-service line total revenue relates to payment on arm’s length terms for work carried out with CMS regarding handling
and collection on our portfolio investments. Payment is made in the form of a commission that is recognized as a cost within
the Portfolio Investments service line.

**_Associated companies and joint ventures_**

_Associated companies_

In accordance with IAS 28 Investments in associates, we recognize participations in associated
companies according to the equity method applicable from the date significant influence first arises,
which means that our holdings are recognized at cost and subsequent adjusted to our share of the
change in the associated company’s net assets. Our consolidated income statement includes our
participation in associated companies’ earnings less goodwill impairment under “Participations in the
earnings of associates and joint ventures.” We do not recognize dividends received from associated
companies in the income statement but instead reduce the carrying value of the investment. We
recognize differences between the cost of an acquisition and the share of the net fair value of the
associated company’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities in accordance with IFRS 3.
If our share of reported losses in the company exceeds the carrying value of our participations, the
value of those participations is reduced to nil. Losses can also be offset against unsecured receivables
from the associated company if such unsecured receivables constitute part of the net investment. We
do not recognize further losses provided we have not issued guarantees to cover them.

_Joint ventures_

In accordance with IFRS 11 Joint arrangements, we recognize our participations in joint ventures, in
which we and other part-owners manage operations jointly in accordance with a shareholder
agreement, in accordance with the equity method from the date on which joint control arises and such
that we are entitled to net assets rather than having a direct entitlement to assets and responsibility for
liabilities. Joint ventures are recognized at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net assets.
In our consolidated income statement, our share of joint venture earnings is reported under
Participations in the earnings of associates and joint ventures. We do not recognize dividends received
from joint ventures in the income statement, but instead reduce the carrying value of the investment.
Shared operations are joint arrangements in which we and one or more partners are entitled to all of
the financial benefits related to the assets of the operations. Shared operations are reported according
to the profit split method under which each party to a joint venture reports its share of assets, liabilities,
income and expenses.

**_Estimation of cash flow forecasts from portfolio investments_**

The estimation of cash flow forecasts (i.e., ERC) is a key uncertainty within our policies on revenue
recognition of portfolio investments. We establish estimates of cash flows that determine the EIR for
each purchased portfolio. The estimates are based on our collection history with respect to portfolios
comprising similar attributes and characteristics, such as date of purchase, debt originator, type of
receivable, customer payment histories, customer location and the time since the original charge-off,
as well as on our experience and the existing schedule of repayment plans on the particular portfolio
for which we are determining EIR.

83


-----

**_Revaluation of portfolio investments_**

Prior to the end of each quarterly reporting period, we evaluate portfolio forecasts to assess whether
there is objective evidence that a portfolio should be subject to revaluation. Indications of positive or
negative revaluation mainly include any significant deviation against the currently active forecast for the
portfolio, but also take into account an assessment of groups of customers experiencing financial
difficulty, default of interest or principal payments, the probability that customers will enter into
bankruptcy, debt restructuring or other financial reorganization and observable data indicating that there
is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic
conditions that correlate with defaults. Conversely, there can also be a positive revaluation in the event
that a portfolio displays objective evidence of expected cash flows above the currently active forecast.

In practice, a number of portfolios are identified each quarter for potential revaluation. Generally,
portfolios will be selected for potential revaluation only where (i) we have owned such portfolio for at
least 12 months, (ii) net collections in the past 12 months (or since the latest revaluation within the past
12 months) for such portfolio have deviated more than 20% positively or negatively against the active
forecast, (iii) net collections in the past 12 months for such portfolio have exceeded €100,000 or
deviation in the last 12 months exceeds €250,000, and (iv) the current carrying value of such portfolio
exceeds €10,000. Portfolios that do not fulfill all four of these criteria are not considered for revaluation
unless a special request is made by country or regional management. Portfolios which fulfill all four
criteria are considered as candidates for a potential revaluation and are analyzed by our staff at group
and local levels to determine if the deviation in the past indicates a need to revise the forecast for the
future. New forecasts may be generated using agreed-upon statistical methods. All changes in active
collection forecasts are then signed off and agreed by our revaluation committee. A change in the
collection forecast may be coupled with an adjustment of the applied EIR for portfolios within a certain
range, whereby the carrying value remains unchanged for portfolios still performing within predefined
limits.

**Key operating metrics for portfolio investments**

During the periods under review, we experienced significant growth in our asset base and cash flow
generation, which we believe is the result of: (i) the growing volume of our portfolios of loans and other
overdue receivables; (ii) our pricing discipline; (iii) the efficiency and sophistication of our debt collection
operations; and (iv) the successful implementation of our strategy regarding the selection, acquisition
and integration of certain credit management businesses, including the Merger.

(1) Vintage corresponds to the year we acquired a portfolio of loans and other overdue receivables. Vintages of portfolios of
loans and other overdue receivables acquired as part of business acquisitions correspond to the year we acquired such
business.

ERC growth over time is primarily due to portfolio purchases. As we collect on existing portfolios, the
ERC on these portfolios will decline. During the periods under review, there have not been any material
changes in forecast expectations at the overall portfolio level. Our ERC on purchased portfolios grew
from SEK 44,603 million as of December 31, 2017 to SEK 60,896 million as of June 30, 2019. The table
below sets forth ERC on purchased portfolios as of the periods indicated.

**Description of principal consolidated statement of financial position line items**

The following is a discussion of our key consolidated statement of financial position line items.

**_Portfolio investments_**

Portfolio investments consist mainly of portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables purchased at
prices significantly below the nominal total collectible value on the portfolios and which are recognized
at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The carrying value of each portfolio corresponds
to the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted by an EIR. The initial EIR is based on
the relation between purchase cost and the projected future cash flows on the date of purchase. See
“—Key factors affecting our results of operations—Recognition of portfolio investments, revenue
_recognition, estimation of cash flow forecasts and revaluation of portfolio investments.”_

**Description of key consolidated income statement line items**

The following is a discussion of our key income statement line items.

**_Total revenue_**

Consolidated total revenue includes income from CMS customers (variable collection commissions,
fixed collection fees, debtor fees, guarantee commissions, subscription income, etc.), income from
portfolio investments in accordance with the effective interest method (where the carrying value of each
portfolio corresponds to the present value of all projected future cash flows discounted by an initial EIR
determined on the date the portfolio was acquired) and positive revaluations of portfolio investments
less negative revaluations of portfolio investments. We apply internal application rules which mean that
the initial effective interest rate can be adjusted in certain cases without a change in the carrying value
of the portfolio for minor projection adjustments within a predetermined interval.

**_Cost of sales_**

Cost of sales are cost of services sold, including production expenses (all costs directly incurred in order
to establish the reported total revenues), sales expense associated with existing clients (costs
associated with the maintenance of existing clients and adding value to the relationship, such as
complaints management) and related IT expenses (running and maintenance costs for IT
infrastructure). Cost of sales include costs for personnel, postage, purchase of external information,
legal and bailiff costs, bank charges for client funds bank accounts, apportioned rent and office costs
as well as depreciation on related fixed assets.

**_Sales, marketing and administrative expenses_**

Sales, marketing and administrative expenses include sales expense associated with new clients (costs
associated with selling activities, preparation of customer contracts, writing of order specifications, sales
promotion, administration of order filling and billing), marketing expenses (advertising, promotion,
marketing staff costs, market analyses, planning of market strategy, sponsoring) and invoicing and
administrative expenses (group, regional and local level costs for finance and human resource
departments as well as board of directors and group and local management). Examples of costs are
staff costs, consultancies, audit fees, costs for IT support, apportioned rent and office costs,
depreciation on related fixed assets.

**_Participations in joint ventures_**

Refers to our share of profit or loss in associates and joint ventures recognized in accordance with IAS
28. For further information “—Recognition of purchased portfolios, revenue recognition, accounting

_of purchased portfolios—Associated companies and joint ventures” and Notes 1, 5 and 13 in the_
Issuer’s Audited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. We are
currently party to the following joint venture arrangements.

_Ithaca Investment DAC_

In April 2018, we entered into a partnership agreement with Banca Intesa Sanpaolo pertaining to the
establishment of a shared Italian collection business and the securitization of non-performing loans
originated by Intesa. In the context of the partnership:

- we acquired a majority 51% holding in a Italian collection business, Intrum Italy S.p.A., to which
Intesa Sanpaolo contributed its service platform for overdue receivables, and Intrum contributed all
of its Italian operations at the time (other than Cross Factor S.p.A and the holding company Lindorff
Italy Srl). Intesa Sanpaolo retains a 49% holding in Intrum Italy S.p.A. In connection with this, Intrum
Italy S.p.A. also entered into a 10-year exclusive servicing agreement with Intesa Sanpaolo for the
vast majority of the bank’s new NPL inflow during this period. Intesa Sanpaolo retains a 49% holding
in Intrum Italy S.p.A, and we therefore consolidate Intrum Italy S.p.A.’s results of operations. At the
same time Intrum together with CarVal acquired 51% of a portfolio of overdue receivables from
Banca Intesa Sanpaolo, which is held by an Italian SPV (as described below).

- through a new joint company, Ithaca Investment DAC (the “Intesa JV”), we own profit participating
corresponding to 80% of the capital of the Intesa JV. The Intesa JV is subject, by agreement, to
controlling influence shared by Intrum and CarVal Investors and we therefore report our interest in
the jointly owned platform as a participation in a joint venture. The Intesa JV has invested in junior
notes and mezzanine loans issued by the Italian company Penelope SPV S.R.L (“Penelope”).
Penelope has invested in overdue receivables acquired from Banca Intesa Sanpaolo. Penelope
also controls the property company, Savoy Reoco S.R.L., which assumes control of seized
collateral in the form of properties. See “—Acquisitions, geographic expansion and divestments”
and “Business—Material contracts, acquisitions and mergers—Banco Intesa Sanpaolo.”

_Ibercaja Banco SA_

In December 2018, we reached an agreement to purchase 6,400 properties in Spain from Ibercaja
Banco SA. The properties were transferred to a new company, Global Zappa SL, of which we were
initially an 80% shareholder and a subsidiary of Ibercaja Banco SA a 20% shareholder (the “Ibercaja
**JV”). In February 2019, we divested 50% of our shares in the new company to a co-investor.**

**_Net financial items_**

Consists of the net of our interest income, interest expenses, exchange rate differences, amortization
and impairment of capitalized borrowing costs and other financial expenses. Other financial expenses
are primarily attributable to bank fees and borrowing costs allocated to the period.

**_Taxes_**

Income taxes consist of current and deferred tax. Current tax is tax that is to be paid or received during
the period in question applying the tax rates applicable on the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is
calculated according to the balance sheet method based on temporary differences between the carrying
value of assets and liabilities and their value for tax purposes.

_Total revenue_

Our total revenue increased by SEK 791 million, or 12%, from SEK 6,745 million in the six months
ended June 30, 2018 to SEK 7,536 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019. Of the 12% increase
in total revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2019, 12% was attributable to acquisitions and
negative 7% was due to organic growth. Organic growth was due to growth in the Portfolio Investments
service line which was mainly due to increased investments in portfolio investments across various
regions of operation during the year ended December 31, 2018, which contributed to an increase in
portfolio investments book value of 17% over the period. On a geographic basis, adjusted for foreign
currency effect, total revenue increased by 3% for the Northern Europe region, 21% for the Central and
Eastern Europe region and 29% for the Western and Southern Europe region and decreased by 10%
for the Iberian Peninsula and Latin America region in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to
the six months ended June 30, 2018.

The table below sets forth our total revenue by service line and as a percentage of consolidated total
revenue for the periods indicated and the percentage increase or decrease in total revenue by service
line from period to period. For a discussion of our service line reporting, see “—Results of operations

_Cost of sales_

Our cost of sales increased by SEK 573 million, or 16%, from SEK 3,616 million in the six months ended
June 30, 2018 to SEK 4,189 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019. The increase was mainly
driven by a greater volume of demand, both organically and due to acquisitions, for our CMS service
line, which has a direct corresponding impact on collections related costs, including employee-related
costs, expensed legal outlays and sending letters. As a percentage of total revenue, cost of sales
remained relatively stable, increasing slightly from 54% for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to 56%
for the six months ended June 30, 2019.

_Sales, marketing and administrative expenses_

Our sales, marketing and administrative expenses increased by SEK 208 million, or 21%, from SEK
992 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 to SEK 1,200 million in the six months ended June
30, 2019. The increase was driven by acquisitions as well as increases in selling expenses associated
with an increase in new clients as well as advertising expenses. As a percentage of total revenue, sales,
marketing and administrative expenses remained relatively stable, increasing from 15% for the six
months ended June 30, 2018 to 16% for the six months ended June 30, 2019.

_Participations in associated companies and joint ventures_

Our income from participations in joint ventures increased from nil in the six months ended June 30,
2018 to SEK 675 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019. The increase was due to the effect of
the Ibercaja JV that was completed in February 2019 and the Intesa JV that completed in December
2018.

_Operating earnings_

Our operating earnings increased by SEK 685 million, or 32%, from SEK 2,137 million in the six months
ended June 30, 2018 to SEK 2,822 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019. The increase was
primarily driven by strong performance by our portfolio investments and offset by the loss and maturing
of high margin business process outsourcing contracts in Spain, for which we have been partly
compensated. Operating earnings include items affecting comparability of negative SEK 89 million for
the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to negative SEK 32 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2018.

The table below sets out our operating earnings by geographic region for the periods indicated and the
associated percentage increase or decrease from period to period.

In Northern Europe, our operating earnings increased by SEK 46 million, or 7%, from SEK 658 million
in the six months ended June 30, 2018 to SEK 704 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019. The
increase was primarily due to strong performance in all countries and in both service lines and to
continuing to focus on collection efficiency to support favorable earnings. Operating earnings adjusted
for foreign currency effect increased by 5%. In Central and Eastern Europe operating earnings
increased by SEK 379 million, or 67%, from SEK 567 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 to
SEK 946 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 due to a growing portfolio of investments, a
maintained level of return and newly acquired units and portfolios delivering good earnings. The region
continues to focus on collection efficiency to support generally favorable earnings. Operating earnings
adjusted for foreign currency effect increased by 64%. In Western and Southern Europe, operating
earnings increased by SEK 526 million, or 317%, from SEK 166 million in the six months ended June
30, 2018 to SEK 692 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019. The increase was primarily due to
our partnership with Banca Intesa Sanpaolo, where in increase in earnings exceeds the increase in
revenues as the earnings from portfolios are reported as a participation in a joint venture without
including the revenues in consolidated revenues. Earnings from the Banca Intesa Sanpaolo portfolio
were somewhat higher than forecast, with this growth offset by the collection platform performing lower
than forecast as volumes have not yet reached the full run-rate as the platform is still in the ramp-up
phase. Operating earnings adjusted for foreign currency effect increased by 314%. In Iberian Peninsula
and Latin America, operating earnings decreased by SEK 266 million, or 36%, from SEK 746 million in
the six months ended June 30, 2018 to SEK 480 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019. The
decrease was primarily due to customer contracts with relatively high margins being terminated in the
second and fourth quarters of 2018. In the first quarter of 2019 we also received a one-off payment in
relation to a contract being terminated prematurely and recognized SEK 146 million in earnings as items
affecting comparability. Declines associated with cancelled customer contracts have been partially
offset by increased volumes due to the Solvia acquisition. Operating earnings adjusted for foreign
currency effect decreased by 39%.

_Net financial items_

Our net financial items increased by SEK 81 million, or 12%, from negative SEK 667 million in the six
months ended June 30, 2018 to negative SEK 748 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019. This
increase was primarily due to the effect to of the application of IFRS 16 from January 1, 2019 which
resulted in a negative SEK 22 million interest cost on leasing liabilities for the six months ended June
30, 2019 and to exchange rate differences which had a positive impact of SEK 32 million on net financial
items for the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to negative SEK 8 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2018.

_Tax expense_

Our tax expense increased by SEK 136 million, or 43%, from SEK 320 million in the six months ended
June 30, 2018 to SEK 456 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019. The tax expense increased
correlated with the increase in earnings before tax. Tax expense as a percentage of earnings before
tax was 22% for both the six months ended June 30, 2019 and the six months ended June 30, 2018.

_Net earnings for the period_

Net earnings increased by SEK 553 million, or 52%, from SEK 1,065 million in the six months ended
June 30, 2018 to SEK 1,618 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019.

_Total revenue_

Our total revenue increased by SEK 1,401 million, or 11%, from SEK 12,832 million in the twelve months
ended June 30, 2018 to SEK 14,233 million in the twelve months ended June 30, 2019. The increase
in total revenue was driven by organic growth in the Portfolio Investments service line. Growth in our
Portfolio Investments service line was mainly due to increased portfolio investments across our regions
of operation during the period.

The table below sets forth our total revenue by service line and as a percentage of consolidated total
revenue for the periods indicated and the percentage increase or decrease in operating total revenue

_Cost of sales_

Our cost of sales increased by SEK 1,004 million, or 14%, from SEK 6,938 million in the twelve months
ended June 30, 2018 to SEK 7,942 million in the twelve months ended June 30, 2019. The increase
was mainly driven by a greater volume of demand, both organically and due to acquisitions, for our
CMS service line, which has a direct corresponding impact on collections related costs, including
employee-related costs, expensed legal outlays and sending letters. As a percentage of total revenue,
cost of sales increased from 54% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 to 56% for the twelve
months ended June 30, 2019. The increase was primarily due to the increase in revenues and
operations over the period.

_Sales, marketing and administrative expenses_

Our sales, marketing and administrative expenses increased by SEK 424 million, or 21%, from SEK
1,985 million in the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 to SEK 2,409 million in the twelve months
ended June 30, 2019. The increase was driven by acquisitions as well as increases in selling expenses
associated with an increase in new clients as well as advertising expenses. As a percentage of total
revenue, sales, marketing and administrative expenses increased from 15% for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2018 to 17% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019.

_Participations in associated companies and joint ventures_

Our income from participations in joint ventures increased by SEK 769 million, or 6,408%, from SEK 12
million in the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 to SEK 781 million in the twelve months ended June
30, 2019. The increase was due to the effect of the Ibercaja JV that was completed in February 2019
and the Intesa JV that completed in April 2018 and for which accounts were consolidated from
December 2018.

_Operating earnings_

Our operating earnings increased by SEK 742 million, or 19%, from SEK 3,921 million in the twelve
months ended June 30, 2018 to SEK 4,663 million in the twelve months ended June 30, 2019. The
increase was primarily due to the twelve month effects of the Merger, increased portfolio investments
in conjunction with pricing discipline and strong performance of portfolio investments. Operating
earnings included items affecting comparability of negative SEK 579 million in the twelve months ended
June 30, 2019.

The table below sets out our operating earnings by geographic region for the periods indicated and the
associated percentage increase or decrease from period to period.

In Northern Europe, our operating earnings remained relatively stable, decreasing slightly from SEK
1,344 million in the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 to SEK 1,340 million in the twelve months
ended June 30, 2019. In Central and Eastern Europe operating earnings increased by SEK 789 million,
or 82%, from SEK 967 million in the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 to SEK 1,756 million in the
twelve months ended June 30, 2019 due to a growing portfolio of investments, a maintained level of
return and newly acquired units and portfolios delivering good earnings, in particular in Greece and
Hungary. The region continues to focus on collection efficiency to support generally favorable earnings.
In Western and Southern Europe, operating earnings increased by SEK 166 million, or 28%, from SEK
400 million in the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 to SEK 754 million in the twelve months ended
June 30, 2019. The increase was primarily due to our partnership with Banca Intesa Sanpaolo, where
an increase in earnings exceeds the increase in revenues as the earnings from portfolios are reported
as a participation in a joint venture without including the revenues in consolidated revenues. Earnings
from the Banca Intesa Sanpaolo portfolio were somewhat higher than forecast, with this growth offset
by the collection platform performing lower than forecast as volumes have not yet reached the full runrate as the platform is still in the ramp-up phase. In Iberian Peninsula and Latin America, operating
earnings decreased by SEK 208 million, or 21%, from SEK 1,210 million in the twelve months ended
June 30, 2018 to SEK 813 million in the twelve months ended June 30, 2019. The decrease was
primarily due to customer contracts with relatively high margins being terminated in the second and
fourth quarters of 2018. Declines associated with cancelled customer contracts have been partially
offset by increased volumes due to the Solvia acquisition. In the last quarter of 2018 and in the first
quarter of 2019 we also received one-off payments in relation to contracts being terminated
prematurely.

_Net financial items_

Our net financial items increased by SEK 208 million, or 17%, from SEK 1,236 million in the twelve
months ended June 30, 2018 to SEK 1,444 million in the twelve months ended June 30, 2019. This
decrease was primarily due to the effect to of the application of IFRS 16 from January 1, 2019 which
resulted in a negative SEK 22 million interest cost on leasing liabilities for the twelve months ended
June 30, 2019 and exchange rate differences which had an impact of SEK 32 million on net financial
items for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 compared to SEK 35 million for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2018.

_Tax expense_

Our tax expense increased by SEK 131 million, or 22%, from SEK 604 million in the twelve months
ended June 30, 2018 to SEK 735 million in the twelve months ended June 30, 2019. The tax expense
increased correlated with the increase in earnings before tax. Tax expense as a percentage of earnings
before tax was 22% for both the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 and the twelve months ended
June 30, 2018.

_Net earnings for the period_

Net earnings increased by SEK 373 million, or 18%, from SEK 2,123 million in the twelve months ended
June 30, 2018 to SEK 2,496 million in the twelve months ended June 30, 2019.

_Total revenue_

Our total revenue increased by SEK 4,008 million, or 42%, from SEK 9,434 million in the year ended
December 31, 2017 to SEK 13,442 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Growth in total
revenue was primarily driven by the full year effects of the Merger as well as an increase in organic
growth due to increased total revenues from the Portfolio Investments service line in which total
revenues, excluding foreign currency effects, rose by 13%. Growth in our Portfolio Investments service
line was driven by both the Merger and increased portfolio investments. For the year ended December
31, 2018, investments in portfolio investments amounted to SEK 11,854 million compared to
investments of SEK 7,223 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, which contributed to an
increase in book value for purchased receivables of 48% over the period. The increase in portfolio
investments was primarily due to the Merger as well as diverse portfolio acquisitions across the regions
in which we operate. On a geographic basis, total revenue increased by 32% for the Northern Europe
region, 37% for the Central and Eastern Europe region, 39% for the Western and Southern Europe
region and 73% for the Iberian Peninsula and Latin America region in the year ended December 31,
2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.

The table below sets forth our total revenue by service line, each service line’s operating total revenue

_Cost of sales_

Our cost of sales increased by SEK 2,320 million, or 46%, from SEK 5,049 million in the year ended
December 31, 2017 to SEK 7,369 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was
mainly driven by a greater volume of demand for our CMS service line, primarily driven by servicing
requirements for our own debt as a result of the Merger which has a direct corresponding impact on
collection-related costs such as expensed legal outlays and sending letters. As a percentage of total
revenue, cost of sales remained relatively stable, increasing from 54% in the year ended December 31,
2017 to 55% in the year ended December 31, 2018.

_Sales, marketing and administrative expenses_

Our sales, marketing and administrative expenses increased by SEK 524 million, or 32%, from SEK
1,646 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to SEK 2,170 million in the year ended December
31, 2018. The increase was driven by completion of the Merger as well as costs corresponding with
increased volume of services being provided. As a percentage of total revenue, sales, marketing and
administrative expenses remained relatively stable, decreasing from 17% in the year ended December
31, 2018 to 16% in the year ended December 31, 2018.

_Provisions for credit losses on accounts receivable_

Our provisions from credit losses on accounts receivable increased by SEK 10 million, or 48%, from
negative SEK 21 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to negative SEK 31 million in the year
ended December 31, 2018. This increase was mainly driven by increased sales revenues in Southern
Europe.

_Participations in associated companies and joint ventures_

Our participations in associated companies and joint ventures increased by SEK 96 million, or 960%,
from SEK 10 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to SEK 106 million in the year ended
December 31, 2018. The increase was due to the Intesa JV which was completed in December 2018.

_Operating earnings_

Our operating earnings increased by SEK 1,250 million, or 46%, from SEK 2,728 million in the year
ended December 31, 2017 to SEK 3,978 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase
was primarily due to the Merger and increased revenues due to organic growth. Operating earnings
include NRIs of a negative SEK 742 million, items affecting comparability of SEK 132 million and
revaluations of SEK 88 million. Accordingly, operating earnings excluding non-recurring items, items
affecting comparability and revaluations increased to SEK 4,500 million in the year ended December
31, 2018 from SEK 3,128 million in the year ended December 31, 2017.

(4) Iberian Peninsula and Latin America includes Portugal, Spain and Brazil.

In Northern Europe, our operating earnings increased by SEK 280 million, or 28%, from SEK 1,014
million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to SEK 1,294 million in the year ended December 31,
2018. The increase was primarily due to the full year effect of the Merger. In Central and Eastern Europe
operating earnings increased by SEK 546 million, or 66%, from SEK 831 million in the year ended
December 31, 2017 to SEK 1,377 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is
primarily due to the full year effect of the Merger, increased revenues due to substantial investment and
strong collection performance, in particular in Greece and Hungary, and offset partially by associated
increases in costs. In Western and Southern Europe, operating earnings decreased by SEK 62 million,
or 21%, from SEK 290 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to SEK 228 million in the year
ended December 31, 2018. The decrease is due to a contract with one of the region’s clients not being
renewed as expected, resulting in lower revenues without an associated decline in costs and partially
offset by increased revenues primarily due to portfolio purchases developing well as well as the
acquisitions of CAF in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the one-month contribution in December 2018 of
the Intesa J.V. Operating earnings for 2018 include a non-recurring item of a negative SEK 46 million
relating to provisions for remaining expenses in connection with a contract with one of the region’s
clients not being renewed as expected. In Iberian Peninsula and Latin America, operating earnings
increased by SEK 486 million, or 82%, from SEK 593 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to
SEK 1,079 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to the Merger,
returns on portfolio investments and cost savings programs and was partially offset by a negative impact
on the Credit Management service line earnings due to client contracts having been discontinued or
have diminished. Operating earnings include items affecting comparability of (i) SEK 401 million in
connection with compensation for a client contract that was discontinued prematurely and (ii) negative
SEK 223 million for impairment in the carrying amount for client relationships with two clients where the
carrying amount was no longer supported by the expected future cash flows.

_Net financial items_

Our net financial items increased by SEK 390 million, or 40%, from negative SEK 973 million in the year
ended December 31, 2017 to negative SEK 1,363 million in the year ended December 31, 2018.
Financial income increased primarily due to a full, rather than half, year of interest expense associated
with the June 2017 Notes. The increase in financial expense was itself partly offset by lower
non-recurring other financial items in 2018 (compared to SEK 316 million for the year ended December
31, 2017) as a result of fees and expenses related to the June 2017 Notes incurred in 2017. Exchange
rate differences had a positive impact as SEK 19 million on net financial items for the year ended
December 31, 2018, compared to SEK 38 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

_Tax expense_

Our tax expense increased by SEK 210 million, or 54%, from SEK 389 million in the year ended
December 31, 2017 to SEK 599 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The tax expense
increased mainly due to the increased earnings before tax, particularly in connection with the Merger,
whereas the tax expense as a percentage of earnings before tax was relatively stable at 23% for the
year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 22% for the year ended December 31, 2017.

_Net earnings for the period_

Net earnings for the period increased by SEK 440 million, or 29%, from SEK 1,503 million in the year
ended December 31, 2017 to SEK 1,943 million in the year ended December 31, 2018.

**Results of operations on a service line basis**

Our service offering is divided into two areas of operations: (i) our CMS service line, which includes

Portfolio Investments service line.

(2) Common costs are costs that are not attributed to either of the CMS or Portfolio Investments service lines, mainly consisting
of shared expenses for sales, marketing and administration.

_Service line total revenue_

An analysis of our total revenue by service line is set forth below:

_CMS service line: total revenue of our CMS service line increased by SEK 406 million, or 8%, from SEK_
4,860 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 to SEK 5,266 million in the six months ended June
30, 2019. Excluding foreign currency effect, total revenue of our CMS service line increased by 7% in
the six months ended June 30, 2019. Growth was offset overall by startup costs associated with the
ramp-up phase of our partnership with Banco Intesa Sanpaolo as well as lower than expected volumes
due to the early stage of the partnership. We expect volumes to increase as previously outsourced
volumes are increasingly managed in-house. The size of our Italian platform means that it has a
significant effect on the group as a whole. Additionally, we continued to face headwinds in Spain due to
the expiration of high margin customer contracts. In the first quarter of 2019, we recognized SEK 175
million in service line revenues as items affecting comparability in connection with a one-off
compensation payment we received in relation to a contract being terminated prematurely. Aside from
Spain and Italy, revenues increased in the majority of countries in which we operate and synergies and
efficiency-enhancing measures began to show earnings in the period.

_Portfolio Investments service line: total revenue of our Portfolio Investments service line increased by_
SEK 396 million, or 13%, from SEK 3,096 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 to SEK 3,492
million in the six months ended June 30, 2019. Excluding foreign currency effect, adjusted revenue of
our Portfolio Investments service line increased by 10% in the six months ended June 30, 2019. The
increase was driven by strong collection in portfolio investments and growth in book value, with a
significant increase stemming from our partnership with Banca Intesa Sanpaolo.

_Service line earnings_

An analysis of our operating earnings by service line is set forth below:

_CMS service line: operating earnings of our CMS service line increased by SEK 48 million, or 4%, from_
SEK 1,371 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 to SEK 1,419 million in the six months ended
June 30, 2019. Excluding non-recurring items and foreign currency effect, operating earnings of our
CMS service line increased by 4% in the six months ended June 30, 2019. The increase in service line
operating earnings was driven by total revenue growth as described above. In the first quarter of 2019,
we recognized SEK 146 million in service line earnings as items affecting comparability in connection
with a one-off compensation payment we received in relation to a contract being terminated
prematurely.

_Portfolio Investments service line: operating earnings of our Portfolio Investments service line increased_
by SEK 814 million, or 48%, from SEK 1,706 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 to SEK

currency effect, operating earnings of our Portfolio Investments service line increased by 45% in the six
months ended June 30, 2019. The increase was driven by total revenue growth as described above.
Ongoing synergies associated from the Merger were also partially offset by currency effects over the
period.

Adjusted for items effecting comparability, common expenses increased as a result of additional
business taxes (in addition to corporate tax) in one of our Central and Eastern European region
companies and as a result of increases expenses associated with building up our management function
in Italy.

_Service line total revenue_

An analysis of our total revenue by service line is set forth below:

_CMS service line: total revenue of our CMS service line increased by SEK 620 million, or 7%, from SEK_
9,266 million in the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 to SEK 9,886 million in the twelve months
ended June 30, 2019. Growth was offset by lower than expected volumes due to the early stage of the
partnership with Intesa Sanpaolo. We expect volumes to increase as previously outsourced volumes
are increasingly managed in-house. The size of our Italian platform means that it has a significant effect
on the group as a whole. Additionally, we continued to face headwinds in Spain due to the expiration of

-----

high margin customer contracts. In the last quarter of 2018 and in the first quarter of 2019 we also
received one-off payments in relation to contracts being terminated prematurely. Aside from Spain and
Italy, revenues increased in the majority of countries in which we operate and synergies and
efficiency-enhancing measures began to show earnings in the period.

_Portfolio Investments service line: total revenue of our Portfolio Investments service line increased by_
SEK 930 million, or 16%, from SEK 5,860 million in the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 to SEK
6,790 million in the twelve months ended June 30, 2019. The increase was driven by strong collection
in portfolio investments and growth in book value, with a significant increase stemming from our
partnership with Banca Intesa Sanpaolo.

_Service line earnings_

An analysis of our operating earnings by service line is set forth below:

_CMS service line: operating earnings of our CMS service line decreased slightly by SEK 30 million, or_
1%, from SEK 2,511 million in the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 to SEK 2,481 million in the
twelve months ended June 30, 2019. In the first quarter of 2019, we recognized SEK 146 million in
service line earnings as items affecting comparability in connection with a one-off compensation
payment we received in relation to a contract being terminated prematurely.

_Portfolio Investments service line: operating earnings of our Portfolio Investments service line increased_
by SEK 1,213 million, or 38%, from SEK 3,201 million in the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 to
SEK 4,414 million in the twelve months ended June 30, 2019. The increase was driven by total revenue
growth as described above.

Adjusted for items effecting comparability, common expenses increased as a result of additional
business taxes (in addition to corporate tax) in one of our Central and Eastern European region
companies and as a result of increases expenses associated with building up our management function
in Italy.

_Service line total revenue_

An analysis of our total revenue by service line is set forth below:

100


-----

_CMS service line: total revenue of our CMS service line increased by SEK 2,780 million, or 41%, from_
SEK 6,700 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to SEK 9,480 million in the year ended
December 31, 2018. Growth in CMS service line revenue was mainly driven by the impact by the Merger
consolidation and higher volumes from servicing our own portfolio investments portfolios and increased
total revenues from acquisitions, particularly CAF Italy (acquired in December 2017).

_Portfolio Investments service line: total revenue of our Portfolio Investments service line increased by_
SEK 1,878 million, or 42%, from SEK 4,516 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to SEK 6,394
million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was driven by the full effect of the Merger
as well as increased portfolio investments, which contributed to an increase in portfolio investments
book value by 17% as of December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. The relatively high level
of portfolio investment is explained by the transaction with Banca Intesa Sanpaolo, a number of major
acquisitions in Greece and Hungary and a diversified collection of medium-sized portfolios purchased
in both mature and emerging markets.

_Service line earnings_

An analysis of our operating earnings by service line is set forth below:

_CMS service line: operating earnings of our CMS service line increased by SEK 729 million, or 43%,_
from SEK 1,704 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to SEK 2,433 million in the year ended
December 31, 2018. The increase in service line earnings was mainly driven by total revenue growth
as described above at low marginal cost increases, due to scale benefits, ongoing operational
efficiencies as a consequence of improved use of analytics and the leverage of our existing servicing
capabilities when servicing our debt portfolios. Growth was offset by the loss and maturing of high
margin business process outsourcing contracts in Spain, for which we have been partly compensated,
and by weaker than expected CMS service line performance in Italy.

_Portfolio Investments service line: operating earnings of our Portfolio Investments service line increased_
by SEK 1,144 million, or 47%, from SEK 2,456 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to SEK
3,600 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was driven by increased operating
total revenues from a higher portfolio investments book value as described above with a stable return
on investment and cost base, and a stronger performance than expected in Italy as well as the one
month effect of the Intesa JV which was completed in December 2018.

**Liquidity and capital resources**

Historically, our liquidity requirements primarily arose as a result of servicing debt, payment of taxes
and funding our purchased portfolios, capital expenditure and working capital. Following the Merger,
our primary source of liquidity has been borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and
cash flow from operations. Additional key sources of liquidity include capital markets transactions,
including the Intrum Existing MTNs and the Intrum Existing Commercial Paper Program.

Historically our collections have generated a stable and predictable cash flow throughout the year in
contrast to the debt purchasing activities, which vary between quarters. Our debt purchasing activities
are driven by supply of portfolios in the market, which we do not control, and our willingness to invest
in any particular available assets at the prevailing price. This can lead to volatility in our free cash flow
on a quarter by quarter basis. For example, in 2018 our quarterly cash flow from investing activities
varied between negative SEK 994 million and negative SEK 9,696 million.

Our operating cash flow generation depends on our future operating performance which to an extent is
dependent on the general economic environment, market competition and the regulatory environment
in jurisdictions in which we operate. See “Risk Factors.”

**_Working capital_**

We believe that our available working capital is sufficient for the twelve months following September 10,
2019.

**_Cash flows_**

The following table sets forth the principal components of our cash flows for the years ended December
31, 2018 and 2017 and the six and twelve months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.

**Cash and cash equivalents at period end ........................................** **1,253** **1,348** **968** **1,237**

_Cash flow generated from operating activities_

Our cash flow generated from operating activities increased by SEK 122 million, or 4%, from SEK 3,127
million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 to SEK 3,249 million in the six months ended June 30,
2019.

Our cash flow generated from operating activities increased by SEK 1,619 million, or 36%, from SEK
4,535 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to SEK 6,154 million in the year ended December
31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to the impact of the Merger and improved operating earnings
excluding depreciation and amortization.

_Cash flow from/(used in) investing activities_

Our cash flow used in investing activities increased by SEK 6,183 million from SEK 2,765 million from
investing activities in the six months ended June 30, 2018 to SEK 3,418 million used in investing
activities in the six months ended June 30, 2019. The increase was mainly due to the non-recurring
cash flow positive effect of the completion of the Divestment in March 2018.

Our cash flow used in investing activities increased by SEK 378 million, or 5%, from SEK 7,547 million
in the year ended December 31, 2017 to SEK 7,925 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The
increase was mainly due to the impact of the Merger and an increase in investments in associated
companies and joint ventures, including the Intesa JV, partially offset by decreased portfolio
investments and the cash flow positive effect of the completion of the Divestment in March 2018.

_Cash flow from financing activities_

Our cash flow from financing activities increased by SEK 5,892 million from negative SEK 5,840 million
in the six months ended June 30, 2018 to SEK 52 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019. Also,
during the quarter, we amended the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to provide for the
establishment of additional facilities. See “Summary—Recent developments” and “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Revolving Credit Facility.”_

Our cash flow from financing activities decreased by SEK 1,574 million, or 41%, from SEK 3,801 million
in the year ended December 31, 2017 to SEK 2,227 million in the year ended December 31, 2018.

**_Capital expenditure_**

Our capital expenditure consists mainly of IT, including both software and capitalized development
expenses (treated as intangible fixed assets) and hardware (treated as tangible fixed assets), plus
investments in equipment and fixtures and fittings.

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, we used SEK 499 million and SEK 251 million,
respectively (€48 million and €25 million equivalent, respectively), of our Cash EBITDA on capital
expenditures other than capital expenditures related to portfolio investments and M&A activities. Capital
expenditure in IT development increased by SEK 8 million, or 4%, from SEK 182 million in the year
ended December 31, 2017 to SEK 190 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, largely associated

(2) Reflects the outstanding aggregate indebtedness under the Intrum Existing MTNs as of June 30, 2019, as adjusted to give
effect to the 2019 MTN Transactions, which includes (i) SEK 1,000 million of Intrum Existing MTNs due 2020 and (ii) SEK
2,900 million of Intrum Existing MTNs due 2023, which were issued as part of the 2019 MTN Transactions and the proceeds
of which were used to repay amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Summary—Recent

We use operating assets through operating lease agreements, primarily leases for our premises in the
countries in which it operates. The minimum remaining payments under such leases within the year
ending December 31, 2018 total SEK 171 million, with SEK 351 million due on these leases in the
following three years (January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2021) and SEK 113 million due on these
leases thereafter. The aforementioned present values include lease commitments that will not be
reported in the balance sheet in accordance with IFRS 16, as they relate to short-term leases or leases
of lower value. For further information see Notes 1 and 30 in the Issuer’s Audited Financial Statements
included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. No single lease is of material significance in terms of
amount.

**_Other financial obligations: pension obligations_**

For a description of certain pension plans and obligations, see Note 21 to our Audited Consolidated
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Off balance sheet arrangements_**

We report pledged assets consisting of deposits (mainly with landlords) and restricted bank balances
that can be claimed by clients, suppliers or authorities in the event that we are not to meet our
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities consisting of payment guarantees. We offer payment
guarantee services whereby, against payment, we guarantee a client’s receivables from their
customers. The service requires that we incur a risk of having to pay clients for the guaranteed amount
in the event that the customer receivables invoices are not paid on time. In those cases where the
guarantee comes into play, we assume the client’s claim against its customer and oversee the claims
case within the Portfolio Investments service line. For details, see Note 25 to the Issuer’s Financial
Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

Certain of our existing joint ventures and co-investment vehicles, for example Ibercaja JV and the jointly
owned Intesa platform, have indebtedness which is only reflected on our balance sheet to the extent of
our proportionate interest in the net assets of such entity. As of June 30, 2019, our proportionate interest
in the net equity of such joint ventures totaled SEK 5,815 million. See “—Description of key consolidated
_income statement line items—Participation in Joint Ventures” and notes 1, 5 and 3 in the Issuer’s_
Audited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about financial risk management**

See Note 34 to the Issuer’s Audited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum for additional information on our exposure to market risk and the risk of loss that may
result from the potential change in exchange rates, interest levels, refinancing and credit risks.

**_Market risk_**

_Market and regulatory environment_

Our primary market risk is related to general macroeconomic conditions and local rules and statutory
regulations in each of the geographical markets in which we operate and which also impacts our clients’
ability and willingness to sell portfolios of loans and receivables, our clients’ customers’ ability to pay
their debts as well as potential commission from third party collection. See “Risk Factors” for a
discussion of these and other factors.

_Foreign exchange risk_

We operate internationally and are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency
exposures, primarily with respect to the Euro, NOK, Hungarian Forint and Swiss Franc, in relation to
our reporting currency Swedish kronor. Foreign exchange risk arises from recognized assets and
liabilities, net investments in foreign operations and any future commercial transactions involving foreign
exchange. Exchange rate risk can be divided into transaction exposure and translation exposure. We
have investments in foreign operations and the associated net assets are exposed to foreign currency
translation risk. Our strategy is to manage and limit exchange rate risk through forward exchange
contracts, interest rate swaps and currency interest rate swaps. For further information on foreign
exchange risk see Notes 1 and 34 of the Issuer’s Audited Financial Statements included elsewhere in
this Offering Memorandum. To an extent, we manage currency exposure arising from the net assets of
our foreign operations through external loans in foreign currency and derivatives.

_Transaction Exposure: revenue and operating expenses derived from national operations are primarily_
denominated in local currencies and thus currency fluctuations have only a limited impact on our
operating earnings in local currency. In addition, our existing indebtedness is primarily denominated in
euro and SEK, and the amounts incurred in euro and SEK do not necessarily match the cash flows
generated from operations in such currencies. Revenue and expenses from national operations are
thus hedged in a natural way, which limits transaction exposure. Our international debt collection and
debt purchasing options, however, are exposed to currency risk.

_Translation Exposure: we have operations in 25 countries. Our results of operations and financial_
position is reported in the relevant foreign currencies and later translated into SEK for inclusion our
financial statements. In the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, 93% and 91%, respectively, of
our revenue was generated in a currency other than SEK. In the six months ended June 30, 2019, 94%
of our revenue was generated in a currency other than SEK. Consequently, fluctuations in SEK
exchange rates against these currencies impact our total revenue and earnings, equity and other line
items in our financial statements. Our total revenue is distributed by currency as follows, expressed in
millions of SEK equivalent.

In the year ended December 31, 2018, with all other variables held constant, a 10% appreciation of the
Swedish krona on average against the euro, Swiss franc, Hungarian forint and Norwegian krone would
have affected revenues negatively by SEK 779 million, SEK 88 million, SEK 120 million and SEK 159
million, respectively.

**_Liquidity risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that we will need to incur higher than expected costs in order to fulfill our short
and long-term payment obligations to external parties. This risk has historically been met through
borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, debt capital market transactions and bilateral loan
agreements and we expect to continue to access these sources for these purposes in the future.

**_Interest rate risk_**

Interest rate risk is the risk of negative impacts on interest income and expenses due to movements in
interest rates. Our interest rate risk relates primarily to the cost of interest-bearing debt. The interest
rates on our debt are tied to the market rate including, in some cases, to floating rate benchmarks. Our
strong cash flow generating business provides us with the option to repay debt or invest in portfolios,
allowing us some flexibility to manage the size and interest expense associated with outstanding debt
and consequently our total interest cost.

**_Credit risk_**

Credit risk is the risk that our counterparties are unable to fulfill their obligations to us. Each of our local
entities is responsible for managing and analyzing the credit risk of each new client before standard
payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. Credit risk arises from assets, such as cash
and cash equivalents, guarantees and derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and
financial institutions, as well as outstanding receivables, portfolio investments and outlays on behalf of
clients. For financial assets owned by us, very limited collateral or other credit reinforcements have
been received. Therefore, the maximum credit exposure for each class of financial assets corresponds
to the carrying amount. There is also a limited risk of loss linked to our debt collection services, however,
this risk is primarily carried by our clients.

To minimize the risks related to purchase of portfolios, caution is exercised in purchase decisions.
Purchases are usually made from clients with whom we have maintained long-term relationships and
therefore have a thorough understanding of the receivables in question. Portfolio investments are
usually purchased at prices significantly below the nominal value of the receivables and is not
collateralized. Other than in the case of co-investments, we retain the full amounts of our collections on
portfolio investments, including interest and fees. For more information on our portfolio investments,
see “—Key factors affecting results of operations—Making portfolio investments at the right price” and
“—Key factors affecting results of operations—Gross collection levels—gross collection levels on
_portfolio investments.”_

**Introduction**

Debt is created when a debt originator extends credit to a person, or a legal entity, who in turn becomes
a customer. Such arrangements occur routinely and include financial institutions extending loans or
trade sector companies (including, _inter alia, telecommunications and utilities companies) issuing_
invoices for services rendered. When a debtor does not repay the debt according to the terms on which
it was extended, the debt becomes overdue. Overdue debt is a structural component of the credit
industry, as debt originators typically expect a certain percentage of customers to default, and price
credit accordingly. Overdue debt is either collected by the originator itself or by a credit management
company, such as us.

**Overview of the European credit management services and debt purchasing industry**

There are a number of stages in the debt lifecycle and credit management companies offer several
services to clients throughout the cycle. A number of credit management services are exemplified in
the following illustration and described in the text below.

**_The Credit Management Services (CMS) industry can be divided into the following two_**
**_sub-segments:_**

_Payment, information and invoice services_

Before debt originators extend credit to debtors, credit management companies provide credit scoring
and other forms of credit information services such as data extraction and modelling. Credit
management companies also provide payment processing services including invoice administration,
subsidiary ledger accounting, invoice printing, payment reminders and invoice purchasing. These
services are provided before debt is overdue.

106


-----

_Debt collection_

Credit management companies provide debt collection services to debt originators for overdue debt.
The debt collection process consists of three phases: pre-legal, legal and enforcement and surveillance.
The pre-legal phase is the first stage in debt recovery and is where the collector seeks to find a voluntary
solution with the debtor, for example through a payment plan. If it is unlikely that the debtor will pay
voluntarily even if that person could afford to pay and/or was aware of the claim, the case is moved to
the legal and enforcement phase where the court system is used to find a solution, for example through
garnishment of wages or sale of collateral. If the debtor is insolvent and the claim is uncollectable the
case moves to the surveillance phase. During this phase, debtors are monitored for any changes in
personal circumstances, such as employment status, that may allow debtors to commence payment.

**_Debt purchasing_**

Debt originators will often sell overdue debt to credit management companies through either: (i) a
one-off sale of an entire NPL portfolio; or (ii) a forward flow agreement where debt claims are sold at a
pre-defined price for a given volume from a client on an ongoing basis. One-off agreements entail buying
a portfolio of claims that are received in one transaction upon payment. Forward flow agreements entail
buying a given volume of claims at a pre-defined price or price range from a client on an ongoing basis.

Selling overdue debt helps debt originators increase their liquidity, strengthen their balance sheets,
release resources to focus on early-stage delinquencies and reduce operational risks, reporting
requirements and regulatory demands. How overdue debt is sold is dependent on the debt originators’
needs and balance sheet strategy. In the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis there was a pressing
need for financial institutions to quickly de-lever balance sheets and therefore NPL sales focused on
larger one-off transactions. Over the last years, we have observed a less immediate but continuous
need for banks to improve their capitalization, and as a result we see an increasing trend towards
forward-flow contracts as an additional measure for banks to manage NPL portfolios on an ongoing
basis. The decision to sell overdue debt can occur at one of several stages throughout the debt
collection cycle, depending on the type of debt, pricing and time since default. Typically, debt is sold
after more than one year in default and following the performance of various non-legal and legal
measures.

**_Market segments_**

The markets for CMS and debt purchasing are typically generated from two sources: financial
institutions and trade. Debt can also be broken down by client type, specifically consumer (“B2C”) and
corporate (“B2B”) debt.

_Financial institution generated debt_

Consumer debt originated by financial institutions primarily consists of bank loans and typically includes
mortgages, credit card loans, car loans, overdrafts and consumer loans. When such loans become
more than 90 days overdue, they are categorized as NPLs. These are typically characterized by a
relatively high average value and long collection times. Typically bank loans are further divided into
unsecured (e.g., credit card) and secured (e.g., mortgage) loans. We view the credit management
services market for debt originated by the financial institutions sector as highly sophisticated.

Historically, we have focused on unsecured consumer debt originated by financial institutions. We have
in recent years expanded our footprint and capabilities in the secured debt market segment. In 2016,
we acquired Aktua in Spain. In 2018, we acquired Solvia from Banco Sabadell, one of the leading real
estate service providers in Spain with more than €21 billion assets under management, entered into a
long-term strategic partnership with Intesa Sanpaolo, creating a market leading servicer of secured and
unsecured non-performing loans in Italy and also acquired a portfolio of 6,400 REOs from Ibercaja and
its affiliates, allowing us to extend Aktua’s servicing contracts. Consequently, we define all consumer
debt originated by financial institutions as our core addressable market (the “Core Addressable
**Market”). In addition to our Core Addressable Market we also address the market for B2B debt**
originated by financial institutions to small and medium-sized enterprises (“SMEs”). We also
opportunistically cover the large corporates segment and therefore include the total European B2B
market for debt originated by financial institutions in our total addressable market (the “Addressable
**Market”). Based on European Banking Authority (“EBA”) data, we estimate the stock of European NPLs**

107


-----

on banks’ balance sheets as of March 31, 2019 stood at €0.7 trillion. This figure (i) does not include
NPLs held by non-bank entities and therefore does not include the large volumes of NPLs sold over the
years to credit funds or debt purchasers such as ourselves and (ii) includes NPLs relating to the large
corporate segment, which we only compete in on an opportunistic basis, as well as B2B debt to SMEs,
both of which are not a part of our Core Addressable Market. As a result, the stock of NPLs in our Core
Addressable Market is significantly smaller than our Addressable Market.

_Trade_

OTRs mainly consist of overdue invoices from corporations. A number of industries are included in the
sector, such as telecommunication, public sector, retail and utility companies. Compared to the financial
institutions sector, debt portfolios originating from the trade sector that are serviced or purchased by
credit management companies typically consist of a larger number of debt claims with a lower average
value and relatively short collection times.

We expect the market outlook for overdue debt in the trade sector to remain stable over the coming
years.

**Key drivers of the credit management industry**

We expect continued high activity in the credit management services industry in the near term as debt
collection outsourcing and debt sales continue to increase due to an increased focus by clients on their
core businesses.

We have identified certain key market trends that we believe are particularly important to the further
development of the credit management services industry in general and in particular the further
development of the financial institutions sector:

- continued elevated level of NPLs on banks’ balance sheets;

- continued creation of new NPLs;

- continued sale of NPLs as banks are under pressure to de-lever and not accumulate new stocks;

- increasing amount of NPLs owned outside the banking systems and requiring servicing; and

- clear industry value proposition resulting in increased volume of outsourcing

**Continued elevated level of NPLs on banks’ balance sheets**

One of the key drivers of the European credit management market, in particular for companies with
large exposure to financial institutions, is the level of NPLs on banks’ balance sheets and, ultimately,
banks’ inclination to divest or outsource collection of such debt. The 2008 - 2010 global financial crisis
accelerated the build-up of NPLs in the European banking system driven by, inter alia, increased default
rates coupled with limited NPL sales activity. The European bank NPL stock increased from
approximately €0.4 trillion in 2007 to approximately €1.2 trillion in 2013. European bank NPL stock has
subsequently decreased to approximately €0.7 trillion as of March 31, 2019 due to banks’ focusing on
deleveraging, primarily via debt sales, but remains at more than 1.5 times the level of NPLs’ observed
prior to the global financial crisis.

The graph below shows the development in the total European NPL stock originated from financial
institutions from 2008 to March 31, 2019 (in € billions) and held on European banks’ balance sheets.

Source: EBA data

**_Continued creation of new NPLs_**

The total European bank NPL stock reported by the EBA was approximately €0.7 trillion as of March
31, 2019. Italy, France, Spain and Greece account for the largest proportion of the NPL volumes and
make up over 60% of total NPL volumes. From a macroeconomic perspective, we expect credit related
to mortgages, consumer and SME/Corporate is projected to grow over the coming years for the sourced
countries. We believe this credit expansion will have an increasing impact on NPLs over time.

**_Continued sale of NPLs as banks are under pressure to de-lever and not accumulate new stocks_**

There are a number of underlying factors for the high level of NPL sales volumes in recent years. In
addition to the buildup of NPLs on banks’ balance sheets, stricter regulations and increased provisioning
levels have incentivized banks to de-lever and sell NPLs in recent years. Additionally, selling NPLs
often provides banks with immediate benefits to liquidity and a positive impact to the profit and loss
statements if the NPLs sold have been substantially written down or written off. Increased regulatory
pressure and supervision (through, _inter alia, continuation of annual European Banking Authority_
stress-tests and stronger supervisory mechanisms, such as Single Supervisory Mechanism, Single
Resolution Board and European Systemic Risk Board), higher capital requirements for financial
institutions as a result of Revised Basel III coupled with the implementation of IFRS 9 and European
Central Bank guidance on prudential provisioning of non-performing loans, is expected to further drive
banks to strengthen their balance sheets and continue NPL sales. Minimum loss coverage for
non-performing exposures under CRR (as defined below) is currently a key regulatory issue confronting
banks and their balance sheets:

_Minimum loss coverage for non-performing exposures under Capital Requirements Regulation (“CRR”):_
Regulation (EU) 2019 / 630 amending the CRR came into effect April 2019, and requires banks to take
an additional deduction from capital where non-performing exposures (“NPEs”) are not sufficiently
covered by other existing adjustments. An NPE, for the purposes of the new rules, includes an exposure
in default per the CRR definition, exposures considered to be impaired under the accounting framework,
an exposure under probation where additional forbearance measures are granted or the exposure
becomes more than 30 days past due, and a commitment which is unlikely to be repaid and a guarantee
which is likely to be called. Under the new regulation, unsecured NPEs must be written off after 3 years
while secured NPEs must be written off after 7 years. NPEs secured by residential/commercial property
or guaranteed residential loans must be written off after 9 years. The aim of this regulation is to
encourage banks to write off exposures more readily, thus accelerating the clean-up of their balance
sheets, as well as to create a secondary market for NPEs.

Given these developments, we expect banks to increasingly manage NPLs in a proactive manner
leading to more regular sales of fresher NPLs.

109


-----

**Increasing amount of NPLs owned outside the banking systems and requiring servicing**

Large amounts of NPLs are also held by non-bank entities, e.g. funds that have no or limited in-house
collection capabilities. Cerberus, Blackstone and Lone Star have been the most active such buyers in
the European NPL market with approximately €200 billion of portfolios purchased for the period between
2014 to the third quarter of 2018. These funds tend to outsource collections to entities providing debt
collection services. Additionally, most funds tend to manage portfolios for a period of time and eventually
sell the portfolios in secondary trades. Lone Star, for example, sold approximately €9 billion of portfolios
during the period from 2014 to the third quarter of 2018. The graph below shows the top 20 most active
buyers from 2014 to the third quarter of 2018 (in € billions).

_Note: Intrum purchases of €11.2 billion presented in the graph above do not represent the entirety of Intrum’s investments for the_
_period._

**_Clear industry value proposition resulting in increased volume of outsourcing_**

We have seen a trend of banks turning away from non-core activities and being unwilling to spend
resources on internal debt collection capabilities. At the same time, mature credit management
providers have emerged and added value to banks through their proven track record of improving
recoveries and scale benefits. Debt collection requires a substantial amount of resources and
know-how, and we believe this is performed most efficiently by specialists. Consequently, credit
management providers have become an integral part of the credit industry and are frequently viewed
as trusted partners to their clients. We believe that this relationship will continue to grow in the coming
years, especially in markets with lower outsourcing ratios, such as Germany and Italy.

In addition to the overall increase in outsourcing of debt collection, we also see a trend where clients
increasingly demand outsourcing solutions from credit management companies at a regional or
pan-European level. As a leading European credit management company, we believe that we are
well-positioned to benefit from this trend.

**Competitive landscape**

The European credit management services industry is a fragmented market consisting of several
thousand companies with varied profiles. When viewing the competitive landscape, three factors should
be considered:

- _Product offering: Companies either offer a full-service business model and operate in all stages of_
the credit management value chain, or they focus on particular areas, such as debt collection or
debt purchasing.

110


-----

- _Geographic presence: Smaller participants tend to only operate in local markets. Medium and large_
companies typically have broader geographical footprints while only a few firms, including us, have
operations across multiple European countries.

- _Scale: The majority of firms are small or mid-sized and have a limited geographic presence, scale,_
skills, experience and information. In contrast, larger firms have the necessary scale to provide a
full-service offering.

Based on these considerations, the industry can be grouped into three categories of participants:

1. _Integrated pan-European credit management companies_

We are one of the few large credit management companies in Europe, which we define as
being present in more than five markets with an integrated offering throughout the credit
management value chain. These companies typically have operations in several countries and
a broad service offering, including both debt collection and debt purchasing. The large
companies have experienced strong growth and high profitability in recent years by capitalizing
on scale in skills, experience, information and origination sources.

The large integrated pan-European credit management companies generally have different
focuses and service offerings. Such pan-European competitors include Lowell and Cabot. We
believe our full-service offering in combination with our focus on the financial institutions sector
is attractive to potential clients and will enable us to capture anticipated growth opportunities
across a variety of markets in the future.

2. _Regional credit management companies_

Most European credit management companies are SMEs active only in one or few local
markets, and have varying scale and business focuses. While these companies have a
presence in their domestic markets, they have a limited or non-existing international presence.
This segment also consists of several thousand participants without sizable operations who
tend to focus on debt collection, as it has lower scale requirements. In addition to smaller credit
management companies focusing on debt collection, there are a number of larger scale
monoline players, which we define as having a presence in less than five geographic markets
and/or who predominantly focus on debt purchasing. Monoline and regional credit management
companies include PRA Group, Hoist and Kruk.

3. _Portfolio investors_

The third group of participants in the credit management industry comprises international
investors specializing in acquisitions of portfolios with distressed assets, such as Cerberus
Capital Management, Lone Star Funds and Fortress Investment Group. The core competency
of portfolio investors is the evaluation of portfolios and the raising of capital. Portfolio investors
compete with other credit management companies in the debt purchasing segment; however
they can also be strategic partners since they typically outsource debt collection. In recent
years, we have created a co-investment vehicle and acted as a co-investor together with
portfolio investors to acquire portfolios and have handled the debt collection process relating to
the portfolios acquired.

**Our place in the industry**

We are the largest European credit management provider, providing a complete service offering, by
revenue, EBITDA and ERC, with operations in 24 European countries. Based on internal estimates we
believe we hold a leading position in a majority of those countries. Our business model focuses on
financial institutions clients and a full-service offering and a balanced business mix between collection
and debt purchasing. We believe that our full service offering offers tangible benefits to our clients,
provides diversification and allows us to extract operational and financial synergies between debt
collection and debt purchasing.

We enjoy strong market positions across the countries in which we operate. The table below provides
an overview of our geographical presence and shows loans and advances volumes, NPL volumes, NPL

**Structural considerations: benefits for incumbents**

We believe that a number of structural factors operating within the European credit management
industry offer potential advantages for incumbent operators:

- _Client relationships: Debt originators, in particular financial institutions, are highly sophisticated and_
sensitive to reputational risk and are hence reluctant to switch credit management partners, in
particular to a new entrant that does not yet have an established track record and reputation.

- _Scale advantages: credit management is a scalable business with clear operational, strategic and_
financial scale benefits that provide a competitive advantage.

- _Data and pricing capabilities: A large database built over many years combined with strong data_
enhancement capabilities is valuable both for pricing portfolios and for developing effective
collection strategies.

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We are the largest European credit management company, providing a complete service offering, by
revenue, EBITDA and ERC, with operations in 24 European countries. Based on internal estimates, we
believe we hold a leading position in a majority of those countries. We provide our clients with a
balanced and integrated mix of services across the entire credit management value chain, including
credit management services and financial services, building upon our longstanding commitment to fair
collection. The economies of scale that we are able to leverage due to our size and our focus on
digitization and information analysis, combined with significant recent strategic transactions, has
allowed us to maintain our strategic focus on both growth and increased efficiency. Our entry in 2018
into a strategic partnership with Banca Intesa Sanpaolo established us as a leading player in late
payments in Italy, one of Europe’s most attractive markets, and our purchase of a real estate portfolio
from Ibercaja Banco SA (“Ibercaja”) along with our acquisition of Solvia Servicios Inmobiliaros
(“Solvia”), a leading supplier of real estate services in Spain, has cemented our leading position in
Spain in real estate servicing (“RES”), which involves servicing of loans related to properties and other
services related to the security/property owned by clients. In 2018, we also implemented our first minor
acquisition in Brazil, allowing us to further expand geographically and to explore the Brazilian market.

We provide two services to customers through our Credit Management Services (“CMS”) service line
and Portfolio Investments service line to ensure that companies that sell products, services or credit are
paid:

**_CMS service line. We employ tailored debt collection strategies and solutions to maximize cash flow_**
streams from loans and other overdue receivables for clients who have decided to outsource their debt
collection function. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, we generated net revenue of SEK
7,443 million (€712 million equivalent) from CMS, excluding revenue generated from portfolios of loans
and other overdue receivables that we own. We also provide leading capabilities in alternative solutions,
such as carve-outs, which involves taking over the in-house collection platform of financial institutions
clients and conducting debt collection on behalf of the financial institutions under a long-term contract
as well as RES.

In addition to, and generally in combination with, collection services, we provide clients with a wide
range of value-added services, prior to loans and receivables becoming overdue, including customer
and credit information and analysis on individuals and companies across Europe to help our clients
assess their potential customers’ payment capacity, data extraction and modelling, selection and
scoring of potential customers, and a full suite of services relating to accounts receivable, including
invoicing, reminders and account ledger services.

**_Portfolio Investments service line._** We offer a range of portfolio investment financial services,
including relating to real estate acquisitions and debt servicing. In particular, we purchase portfolios of
secured and unsecured loans and other overdue receivables from our clients for a portion of the nominal
value, which we then service using our in-house debt collection function, with a few exceptions.
Following the purchase of the defaulted receivables, our long-term debt collection measures
commence, aimed at helping consumers become debt-free as we help them reduce their debt in a
respectful manner, for example through instalment plans that take account of each consumer’s payment
capacity. We also, either in the course of recovery activities for secured loans (or, infrequently, in
relation to unsecured loans with personal guarantees) or as a standalone investment strategy, directly
or indirectly and independently or alongside co-investors, hold title to real estate that we expect to
eventually resell. We arrange for the sale of such real estate using internal and external resources and
networks. Our real estate exposure is concentrated in Spain, Italy, Portugal and Hungary and, together
with properties held by joint ventures in which we participate along with our co-investors, totals
approximately 6,000 properties with a book value of €259 million as of June 30, 2019. For the twelve
months ended June 30, 2019, we generated revenue of SEK 6,790 million (€650 million equivalent)
from our Portfolio Investments service line. As of June 30, 2019, the ERC of our portfolios of loans and
overdue receivables was SEK 60,896 million (€5,768 million equivalent). As part of our Portfolio
Investments service line, we also provide factoring, payment guarantees and e-commerce services.

We believe that the combination of portfolio investments and debt collection has been and will continue
to be key to our success. Our range of services helps attract and retain clients and increases the breadth

and depth of collectible data, in turn supporting the creation of tailored collection strategies and
development of analytical capabilities to enable more accurate pricing of portfolios. Operating across
Europe and with a balanced business model also gives us investment optionality as we can allocate
resources across our platform and jurisdictions to the opportunities that we find most attractive. For the
twelve months ended June 30, 2019, our revenue was SEK 14,233 million (€1,362 million equivalent)
and _Pro Forma_ Cash EBITDA was SEK 10,370 million (€993 million equivalent). See “Summary
_Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data.”_

**Our Strengths**

We believe that our business benefits from a number of key strengths, including:

**_Europe’s leading credit management company_**

_The largest credit management company in Europe_

We are the largest European credit management company, providing a complete service offering, by
revenue, EBITDA and ERC. We are significantly larger than the second largest such credit management
company in Europe. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, our Cash EBITDA was SEK 9,655
million (€924 million equivalent) and our Pro Forma Cash EBITDA was SEK 10,370 million (€993 million
equivalent). We believe our size gives us several benefits. In particular, our broad and in-depth
experience favorably impacts our ability to develop optimal collection strategies and competitively price
portfolios in our portfolio investment activities, which we believe has a positive impact on our revenue
and efficiency. Additionally, our size allows us to better absorb fixed costs, compared to smaller
companies, including those related to regulatory and legal compliance and information technology (“IT”),
which further benefits our margins. We also believe that our scale, leading positions, full scope of
services across the CMS value chain and broad geographic footprint make us increasingly relevant for
our largest clients, provides us with increasing sources of opportunities across Europe and enables us
to efficiently allocate capital to opportunities with the best risk/reward profiles.

_Market leading position in several European countries_

We are present in 24 European countries, which is more than any of our European competitors. Based
on our internal estimates, we believe we hold a leading position in the majority of those countries. We
believe our broad geographic footprint combined with strong local market positions is a competitive
advantage which continues to enhance our ability to serve our existing clients with a complete service
offering across diverse markets and the full CMS value chain and also to expand client relationships.

_Leading position in the European financial institutions segment_

Based on our internal estimates, we believe that we hold one of the leading positions among credit
management providers with respect to financial institutions clients in Europe. We believe that the
financial institutions segment in Europe continues to represent one of the most attractive segments of
the credit management market. Financial institutions are the largest originator of debt and, based on
data from the EBA, European bank NPL stock amounted to approximately SEK 7 trillion (€0.7 trillion
equivalent) as of March 31, 2019. The financial institutions segment also offers attractive economics
with long durations and high earnings visibility. We have a long track record of collecting on NPLs and
have built long-term relationships with European financial institutions. During the three years ended
December 31, 2018, we acquired NPLs with a total collectible value on portfolio investments of SEK
443,069 million (€44,312 million equivalent) from European financial institutions. For the year ended
December 31, 2018, 79% of revenue in our Portfolio Investments service line was generated by
portfolios acquired from financial institutions. In addition, we have a strong track record in entering into
strategic partnerships with financial institutions, including long-term servicing contracts and often the
carve-out of operational servicing platforms.

_Leading position in the European trade segment for CMS and portfolio investments_

Based on our internal estimates, we believe that we hold one of the leading positions among credit
management providers in providing servicing and acquisition of overdue trade receivables (“OTR”) to
non-financial services companies in Europe. The OTR segment complements the financial institutions
segment as it offers a relatively stable and high volume of stock with short duration. In many of the
markets in which we operate, we believe OTR flow will remain at high levels in the short-term, driven

114


-----

by increased household spending, a structural shift towards a higher proportion of invoice payments
and increased outsourcing of CMS operations.

**_Europe’s most diversified credit management company_**

_Complete service offering_

In addition to having the widest European geographic footprint, we believe that we have the European
market’s broadest service offerings across the CMS value chain, including financial services, enabling
us to operate as a “one-stop shop” for our clients. Our predominant activities are in CMS and portfolio
investments. Additionally, within our CMS service line, we offer value-added services before loans and
receivables become overdue, including information, invoice and payment services, which are an
important source of origination for our CMS and portfolio investment businesses and for data collection.
Our broad product and service offering is complemented by our ability to offer flexible solutions to our
clients, including by leveraging our market-leading capabilities in the carving-out of financial institutions’
in-house collection units, co-investment structures and the provision of RES.

_Ability to acquire and service several types of loans_

Historically, we have focused on unsecured consumer debt originated by financial institutions and OTRs
originated by the non-financial sector. In recent years, we have also increased our activities in the
secured consumer debt market segment, including through key acquisitions such as the June 2016
acquisition of Aktua Soluciones Financieras Holdings, S.L. and its subsidiaries (“Aktua”), one of the
leading credit management companies in the secured NPL segment in Spain, further strengthening our
RES capabilities and the purchase of a real estate portfolio from Ibercaja in December 2018. We now
work with secured assets in 10 countries, further demonstrating our capabilities across diverse types of
loans.

**_Integrated client offering spanning both CMS and Portfolio Investments service lines_**

_Data analytics_

Our broad service offering allows us to collect data through the CMS value chain and extract data
synergies to continuously strengthen our data analytics capabilities. We consider data analytics and
business intelligence to be important in driving optimized collection strategies and accurately and
competitively pricing the portfolios for which we bid. We estimate that we have collected depersonalized
data on over 296 million claims across both debt collection, sourced from within our CMS service line,
and portfolio investments, sourced from within our Portfolio Investments service line. We also estimate
that we have a data warehouse consisting of over 10.3 billion events, such as payments and actions
taken, associated with the claims on which we have collected depersonalized data.

_Operational synergies_

The combined scale we achieve through the breadth of our service offering as well as our pan-European
footprint provides us with economies of skill and scale. Given the scalable nature of our business model,
operational synergies are important drivers of increased operational efficiency. In the twelve months
ended June 30, 2019, our EBITDA margin increased to 38% compared to 37% for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2018.

_Financial complementarity_

With our integrated and balanced business model we can solve for our clients’ needs and offer a total
solution across the CMS value chain. Additionally we benefit from the financial complementarity
between our two service lines, whereby capital-light earnings from the CMS service line (SEK 2,481
million (€237 million equivalent) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019) generate cash which can
be utilized for portfolio investments and deleveraging.

**_Diversified origination platform_**

_Pan-European presence, multi-sector and transaction structure capabilities_

Our pan-European presence, with operations in 24 European countries, enables us to efficiently allocate
capital to opportunities with the best risk/reward profiles. We have capabilities with respect to financial
institutions as well as across multiple trade sectors, including utilities, telecommunications and retail,
which allows flexible capital deployment for portfolio investments and enhances our ability to identify
and take advantage of trends in various sectors in the CMS service line. Furthermore, we benefit from
our successful experience in executing co-investments which provides us with the resources to swiftly
capitalize on market opportunities, allowing us to acquire larger and more mixed portfolios. Additionally
our centrally organized Alternative Asset Group (“AAG”), which focuses on secured and sizeable B2B
transactions, gives us the capacity and capability to address large, complex and sensitive transactions,
as well as centrally coordinate and attract co-investors and secure additional sources of funding, as
demonstrated by our strategic partnership with Banca Intesa Sanpaolo (“Intesa Sanpaolo”) and the
acquisition of the REO portfolio from Ibercaja. In addition to generating Portfolio Investments revenues,
these transactions also act as growth accelerators of our CMS service line, through the subsequent
contracts to service the acquired portfolios, while requiring a lower level of upfront capital investment.
Our extensive pan-European presence also allows us to provide CMS services to, and increase our
share of wallet with, clients who have cross-border and across service activities across service lines.

_Long-term relationships with our CMS clients_

We have an impressive track record of maintaining long-term relationships with our largest clients and
we have also historically achieved high levels of repeat purchases from existing customers, which we
believe evidences the strength of our product and service offerings. Of our 20 largest clients in the CMS
service line, 17 have had a relationship with us lasting more than 10 years, of which 8 have had a
relationship of more than 15 years and the relationship with our largest client extends beyond 25 years.

_Large number of repeat and small purchases_

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, we purchased SEK 1,666 million (€160 million equivalent)
of loans and other overdue receivables under forward flow contracts, providing visibility on new
business origination. Additionally, over the same period, we made SEK 518 million (€49 million
equivalent) of smaller purchases of portfolios of less than SEK 21 million (€2 million equivalent) in size.
As of June 30, 2019, our average portfolio investment claim size was SEK 15,200 (€1,400 equivalent).

_CMS enables a competitive tendering process benefitting the portfolio investment part of our business_

When bidding for portfolios from our existing CMS clients, we are able to leverage our existing business
relationship, accurately and competitively price portfolios that we find attractive and offer an attractive
value proposition to clients that is informed by our knowledge of, and provision of other services to, the
specific client.

_Significant supply of NPLs in the market_

Based on data from the EBA, European bank NPL stock amounted to approximately SEK 7 trillion (€0.7
trillion equivalent) as of March 31, 2019, representing more than 1.5 times the 2007 levels. We expect
continued regular and pro-active sales by banks as they manage a broad range of new rules and
regulations such as, for example, Basel IV, IFRS 9 and ECB calendar provisioning. As a result, we
anticipate an increase in debt sales as a proportion of NPL stock. Ultimately, the evolution of NPL stock
depends on the macroeconomic situations of the countries in question. For example, in a downturn, we
would expect an increase in the generation of new NPLs. However, in a favorable macroeconomic
environment, NPL generation is more muted, as evidenced by NPL levels for the last few years. See
“Industry Overview—Key Drivers of the Credit Management Industry.”

**_Track record of continuous operational excellence, innovation and efficiency improvements_**

We benefit from a strong culture that is focused on innovation and operational improvement to drive
financial performance. We have historically undertaken a range of initiatives that have improved our
collection and margins and that we believe will continue to improve the performance of our business.
These include, among other things:

116


-----

- _standardization:_ consolidating infrastructure among subsidiaries, aligning operational processes
and reducing the number of physical collection sites and IT and virtual collection systems;

- _data management:_ centralizing data pools and implementing data cleansing techniques and
analytical tools to support enhanced decision-making;

- _digitalization: investing in self-service consumer and client portals to facilitate timely and transparent_
communication and proactive management of credit management services;

- _automation: deploying sales-based robotics with advanced software capable of replicating human_
activities and exploring the application of artificial intelligence to operational processes; and

- _shared services:_ consolidating and near-shoring shared services and continuing to evaluate
expansion to additional service centers.

In addition, we continue to benefit from significant cost synergies associated with the merger of Intrum
Justitia AB (publ) and Lindorff completed on June 27, 2017 (the “Merger”). Our integration efforts are
delivering the desired results, with approximately 90% of the planned synergies having been
successfully implemented by June 30, 2019. See “—Our Strategy—Continue to drive profitability
_through operational excellence and realization of operational synergies.”_

**_Strong embedded risk culture_**

We benefit from well-defined and multi-layered risk management frameworks and a rigorous approach
to maintaining pricing discipline that we believe will continue to support profitability through active and
effective management of pricing, reputational and regulatory risks throughout our investment decisionmaking process. Through the breadth and depth of our experience throughout the CMS value chain we
have access to comprehensive databases of purchased and serviced debt to which we apply our data
analysis capabilities in order to take a centralized approach to forecasting and pricing. Our centralized
forecasting and pricing is further supported by specialist local input, ensuring that the pricing of each
portfolio benefits from a strong cross-organizational evaluation. Our data capabilities also facilitate more
efficient debt collection strategies through data analytics and cross-learning. In addition, our three-tiered
risk management approach helps ensure that our sophisticated pricing information is used in an
investment decision-making context that is grounded in compliance and the maintenance of strong
internal controls. Our focus on risk management and compliance is incorporated into our structure at
the local level, which is our first line of defense, and up through both the internal and independent
external risk control and auditing functions that are carried out at our executive and board levels. All of
our portfolio acquisitions are subject to a standardized process involving independent review by our risk
function and investment authority, with the largest transactions requiring approval by our Board of
Directors.

We believe that our focus on pricing discipline and risk management has historically enabled us to
consistently outperform our forecasted collections. From January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2019, on a
quarterly basis we collected 105 – 115% of our cash flow forecasts.

**_Resilient financial performance with strong cash generation_**

_Track record of stable revenue growth and expanding margins_

We have a track record of delivering revenue growth and EBITDA margin expansion. For example,
during the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, our net revenue grew at 11% and our EBITDA margin
increased from 37% in the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 to 38% in the twelve months ended
June 30, 2019. We believe there is potential for further top-line growth based on favorable market
dynamics and our capital deployment flexibility. Additionally, we believe our EBITDA margin will
continue to be positively impacted by our operating leverage, ongoing cost savings initiatives and
realization of synergies associated with the Merger.

_Stable cash flows and a unique dataset from the capital light CMS service line_

Our CMS services, which require relatively limited investment, generate stable cash flows and are
supported by long-term client relationships. As of June 30, 2019, we manage third-party debt with a
combined total collectible value on third-party debt of SEK 920,313 million (€87,187 million equivalent).

117


-----

Furthermore, we benefit from several long-term servicing contracts related to carve-out transactions
with financial institutions. We also benefit from system integration with clients associated with the
provision of our services, making it unattractive from the client perspective to switch credit management
companies. Overall, we tend to experience strong client loyalty and limited attrition.

_Significant cash flows embedded in investment portfolios_

As of June 30, 2019, our estimated remaining collections (“ERC”) was SEK 60,896 million (€5,786
million equivalent). We have made significant portfolio investments over the past two years. For the
years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we acquired portfolios for SEK 11,854 million and SEK
7,223 million, respectively. We expect these investments to generate significant cash flows over the
coming years. We have a long track record of outperforming our initial collection forecasts during the
initial forecast period up to 15 years as well as a track record of extending collection periods beyond 15
years.

_Strong cash generation with efficient conversion of profit into cash flow_

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, we used SEK 499 million and SEK 251 million,
respectively (€48 million and €25 million equivalent, respectively), representing 5% and 3%),
respectively, of our Cash EBITDA on capital expenditures other than capital expenditures related to
portfolio investments and M&A activities. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, our
total portfolio investments were SEK 10,809 million and SEK 7,772 million, respectively (€1,035 million
and €784 million equivalent respectively). For additional information on our cash conversion rates, see
“Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and
_capital resources.”_

**_Proven management team with a clear strategic agenda_**

_Strong leadership of experienced senior management supported by specialist teams in central_
_functions and local markets_

We are managed by a strong executive team comprising individuals with many years of relevant
experience and providing leadership across all functional areas of the business. Our CEO, Mikael
Ericson, was formerly Head of International Banking at Danske Bank A/S, one of the leading banks in
the Nordic region, and CEO of Carnegie Investment Bank AB. Our CFO, Anders Engdahl, is an
experienced financial professional who has held senior positions at Intrum, Lindorff and Morgan
Stanley. At Morgan Stanley, Anders held the position of Managing Director and Head of Nordic Financial
Institutions investment banking. Anders possesses a strong background in the credit management
services sector, having joined Lindorff in 2014 as EVP of Debt Purchasing. Anders held the same role
at Intrum subsequent to the Merger. Our executive team is supported by a skilled team of managers
operating our central functions and assisting in strategy execution at the group level. In addition, our
regional and country managers bring to bear significant industry expertise and local input to drive
execution of our strategic agenda.

**Our Strategy**

**_Be the leading CMS company driving operational excellence_**

We are the largest and most diversified credit management company in Europe with one of the leading
positions in the majority of countries in which we operate, based on internal estimates, and the ability
to serve clients across the full CMS value chain and across various asset classes. We aim to continue
to build scale, lead in all markets where we operate, create value for clients, and achieve operational
excellence in everything we do.

**_Continue to operate an integrated business model providing a complete service offering_**

We believe that we continue to be well-positioned for growth and continue to offer complete credit
management solutions for our clients across asset classes and sectors based on our integrated and
balanced business model. Key features of our growth strategy include:

- _Full client offering providing integrated CMS and financial services solutions. We offer our clients_
both CMS and financial services solutions, providing them with the full scope of services across the

118


-----

CMS value chain. We believe that our full service offering, geographic footprint and scale are highly
attractive to existing and potential clients. For instance, our recent entry into a partnership with
Intesa Sanpaolo includes entering into a long-term CMS contract as well as our acquisition, through
a joint venture, of an NPL portfolio from Intesa Sanpaolo. See “Business—Material contracts,
_acquisitions and mergers—Banca Intesa Sanpaolo.” The transaction demonstrates the breadth of_
our capabilities and the attractiveness of our service offering to our clients. Furthermore, we see
opportunities to increase our share of wallet with existing CMS clients by providing services to them
throughout their geographic footprint and service needs. Additionally, our CMS business line
provides us with deep insight into the portfolios of our clients and enables us to competitively price
portfolios.

- _Continued focus on acquisitions of unsecured NPL and expansion of consumer (“B2C”) debt,_
_secured debt and real estate services: Unsecured consumer NPL sales volumes have remained_
high as banks increasingly prefer to sell their debt to trusted debt collection agencies in order to
clean up their balance sheets and enable them to focus on their core business. We expect a
continued high level of NPL sales, given factors such as the growth in consumer lending and
European Central Banks (“ECB”) regulation of NPLs. We expect to continue to deploy capital within
the unsecured NPL space in order to gain scale in markets where we are not a leader and, to a
lesser extent, to opportunistically enter new segments. We expect to continue to partner with banks
on bilaterally agreed large, complex and sensitive transactions, of which our Intesa Sanpaolo
partnership is a recent example. Additionally, secured NPL transactions have increased in recent
years and represent a large portion of the NPL market. Our acquisition of Aktua, one of the leading
credit management companies in the secured NPL segment in Spain, in June 2016 significantly
strengthened our secured consumer capabilities and added RES capabilities to our service offering.
In December 2018, we reached an agreement with Ibercaja to acquire 6,400 properties in Spain
via a joint venture and in April 2019 we completed the acquisition of Solvia, which offers real estate
management services in the Spanish market, from Banco Sabadell, both of which further build out
our RES capabilities. See “Business—Material contracts, acquisitions and mergers—Solvia
Servicios Immobiliaros.” We expect to continue our systematic expansion in the secured NPL and
RES segment through greenfield operations and opportunistic acquisitions. We see growth
potential from leveraging and exporting the capabilities we have developed in secured and RES
markets across many of the geographies in which we operate.

- _Co-investments: In our portfolio investments segment, we see a pipeline in terms of the number_
and the size of investment opportunities available, which may outpace our on-balance sheet
investment appetite. We consider flexible capital deployment initiatives, such as co-investment
structures, which provide us with the ability to acquire larger, mixed portfolios due to risk sharing
with co-investment partners. Co-investments also increase the breadth of our origination platform
by leveraging the network of our co-investment partners. These transactions, in addition to
generating revenues from portfolio investments, also act as growth accelerators of third-party debt
collection while requiring a lower level of upfront capital investment.

- _Geographic expansion: We have a strong track record of expansion into new markets and_
expanding our presence within existing markets. We have established operations in 25 countries,
including through partnerships and strategic transactions such as carve-outs and bolt-on
acquisitions. For example, in December 2018 we entered into a strategic partnership with Intesa
Sanpaolo, establishing us as a leading player in late payments in Italy, one of Europe’s most
attractive markets, and in June 2019 we announced we had entered into an agreement to acquire
an 80% stake in Piraeus’ Recovery Banking Unit platform in Greece (“Piraeus Partnership”).
Based on EBA data, our geographic footprint covers 98% of European NPLs, as of March 31, 2019.
Going forward, we will continue to proactively evaluate opportunities to expand in existing markets
where we currently do not hold leading positions and, to a lesser extent, opportunistically enter new
markets, for example through carve-outs and targeted acquisitions. When entering new markets,
our strategy is typically based on a cautious first entry: we start small and increase our investments
as our insight and experience in a particular market increases. Moreover, we often strengthen our
local knowledge and databases through business acquisitions and/or carve-out transactions (as we
have previously done in the United Kingdom, Spain, Poland and Italy). For example, one method
we employ to enter a new market involves acquiring a company with existing debt servicing
capabilities and data, operating the company to develop further knowledge and data capabilities

119


-----

and then leveraging this data and market knowledge to price and purchase debt in the newly
entered market.

**_Continue to drive profitability through operational excellence and the realization of operational_**
**_synergies_**

We have a long history of commitment to operational excellence and a track record of improving our
margins. We have identified several initiatives to further drive efficiency improvements and increase our
profitability going forward, including:

- _Operational integration and portfolio management: We have identified four key operational levers_
which we continue to execute on: utilization of shared services and scale opportunities, focus on IT
effectiveness and efficiency, best-in-class sourcing and procurement and continuing to deploy best
practices across our operations to maximize synergy opportunities. We seek to leverage scale and
skills advantages and experience in data management, analytics and digitalization to drive
collection performance across our CMS and Portfolio Investments service lines. We continue to see
strong value potential in focusing on active portfolio management.

- _Focus on pricing discipline, risk management and compliance: As a result of strict pricing discipline,_
institutionalized investment processes and operational improvements, from January 1, 2017
through June 30, 2019, on a quarterly basis we have collected 105 - 115% of our cash flow
forecasts. We intend to continue demonstrating a high level of underwriting discipline in order to
maintain forecasting accuracy and to ensure that we only acquire portfolios that meet our
investment return criteria. In addition, we seek to maintain our competitive advantage through
continued early adoption of regulation and best-in-class compliance and risk management
procedures.

- _Realize operational synergies: As of June 30, 2019, we have successfully realized 90% of the SEK_
680 million of cost savings and synergies we expect to achieve as a result of the Merger. Our
management estimates that we will achieve the remaining synergies by the end of 2019.
Implementation costs in relation to the remaining cost synergies are expected to be SEK 90 million
(€9 million equivalent). Cost savings realized to date primarily relate to optimization of operations
centers, consolidation of administrative and support functions, harmonization of IT systems and
application development/maintenance, and increased scale in procurement. We have also
capitalized on certain revenue synergies associated with the Merger from the combination of
business intelligence operations and data sets, cross-selling of complementary offerings to existing
clients, improved cross-border coverage of international clients and transfer of best practices.

**_Commitment to highest ethical standards and fair collection practices_**

We are dependent upon relationships characterized by trust with clients, the relevant authorities and
society as a whole. In order to achieve the necessary level of trust, we must act with professionalism,
expertise and high ethical standards at all levels of our operations. Our internal standards are applicable
to all employees. These standards mandate that all employees are expected to always work within the
law, have sound moral principles and behave in an upstanding and sincere way. We have implemented
a centrally coordinated compliance monitoring program which evaluates and assesses compliance with
legal, regulatory and industry best practices as well as our internal standards. The continued
commitment to the highest ethical and fair collection practices is paramount to our ability to be the
leading credit management company in Europe.

**_Commitment to financial targets_**

In the past, we have publicly committed to achieving certain financial targets, including with respect to
leverage, earnings per share, portfolio return on investments and dividend policy. In particular, by the
end of 2020, we aim to achieve the following financial targets:

- Net Debt/Cash EBITDA: 2.5 - 3.5x

- EPS: SEK 35

- Portfolio ROI: >13%

120


-----

- Dividend: >50% pay-out ratio on average over time, based on net earnings after tax over time.

These financial targets have been prepared and verified in good faith by our management based on
our forecasted business plan, which are subject to a number of assumptions, and have not been audited
or reviewed by our independent auditors or any other person. As these financial targets are forecasts
and dependent on future performance, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on them.
Where our financial targets are expressed as a range, there can be no assurance as to where within
such range our actual results of operations will in fact be.

In preparing financial targets, we have in general assumed that there will be no material changes in
existing political, legal, fiscal, market or economic conditions or in applicable legislation, regulations or
rules (including, but not limited to, accounting policies and accounting treatments), which, individually
or in the aggregate, would be material to our results of operations and that we will not become party to
any litigation or administrative proceeding of which we are currently unaware that might have a material
impact on our results of operations. Such assumptions may prove to be incorrect, we may decide to
alter our short- or medium-term priorities or strategic plan or we may decide to deviate from our financial
targets at any time, for example if compelling business or investment opportunities arise. Other factors
that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such targets include, but are not limited to,
those described under “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.”

**History**

Intrum was established in 2017 as Intrum Justitia and Lindorff combined to become one company. On
the Intrum Justitia side, we trace our origins to Sven Göranson founding a credit management services
company in 1923 in Sweden. In the aftermath of World War I, as European economies were rebuilding,
companies were encountering difficulties securing payment from their customers on time, or at all. The
companies that Sven Göranson founded became pioneers in developing processes to obtain credit
information prior to lending and in specialized collection operations. Following World War II and through
the 1960s, Europe experienced economic growth and an upswing in purchasing on credit. During this
period, one of the companies founded by Sven Göranson, Justitia Inkasso och Juridiska byrå AB,
became Sweden’s premier collection agency. Expanding both organically and through acquisitions, by
the 1980s its service offering included a comprehensive range of services for credit administration,
including collection, financial and administrative services and factoring. In 1982, Justitia Inkasso och
Juridiska byrå AB changed its name to Intrum Justitia AB (publ). In the years following, Intrum Justitia
continued to expand, both through acquisitions and organic growth, to become one of Europe’s leading
credit management companies.

Lindorff was founded in 1898 in Norway by Eynar Lindorff. From its origins in Norway, it grew to become
one of the leading credit management providers in Europe. In October 2014, Nordic Capital acquired
85% of Lindorff, and in mid-2015, Nordic Capital increased its ownership of Lindorff to 91% (the “Prior
**Lindorff Acquisition”). Lindorff solely operated in Norway until 1998, after which it expanded into other**
Nordic and Baltic countries. Subsequently, Lindorff undertook significant European expansion, both
organically and through acquisitions.

Upon completion of the combination of Intrum Justitia and Lindorff in 2017 (the “Merger”), we became
the leading credit management provider in Europe. Our shares have been listed on Nasdaq Stockholm
since June 2002 and have been listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm Large Cap list since January 2014.

In the past three years, in addition to the Merger, we have carried out various acquisitions to
complement our established operations. Historically, we have focused on investing in unsecured
consumer debt, but from 2016 we have increased the scope of our investments in purchased
receivables to include new asset classes, primarily secured claims, including the acquisition of a large
portfolio from Erste Bank Hungary, consisting of consumer loans with real estate collateral. In June
2016 Lindorff also completed the acquisition of 85% of Aktua. Aktua is a servicing company providing
mainly secured NPL services and real estate servicing in Spain. In April 2017, we completed the
acquisitions of Top Factoring, one of the leading portfolio investment companies in Romania, and in
December 2017 we acquired CAF, an Italian credit management company which included a large and
diversified debt portfolio. In November 2018, we formed a new joint venture, the Intesa JV, with Intesa
Sanpaolo to which the bank contributed its service platform for overdue receivables and to which we
contributed most of our Italian operations at the time. In December 2018, we acquired 6,400 properties
in Spain from Ibercaja, which were transferred to a new company in which we were initially the sole

121


-----

majority shareholder, and in which since February 2019 we have held a majority ownership along with
a co-investor, with Ibercaja retaining a minority interest. In April 2019, we completed our acquisition of
80% of the shares of Solvia, which offers real estate management services in the Spanish market, from
Banco Sabadell. We have also expanded geographically. In February 2017, we completed the
acquisition of 1st Credit, representing our re-entry into the UK market, in October 2017, we entered the
Greek market by acquiring a debt portfolio from Eurobank and in July 2018, we expanded into the
Brazilian market when we acquired a majority shareholding position of 51% in the credit management
company iPlatform. In June 2019, we announced a long-term strategic partnership with Piraeus Bank,
under which we agreed to acquire 80% of Piraeus Bank’s Recovery Banking Unit in combination with a
long-term non-performing exposures serving agreement, establishing a strategic partnership in the
Greek NPL servicing market.

As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 80,000 clients and approximately 9,000 employees
as well as operations in 25 countries. Following the Merger, Nordic Capital is our largest shareholder.
As of June 30, 2019, Nordic Capital held 44% of our shares, with no other shareholder holding 10% or
more of our shares. As a condition of the Merger, the European Commission required us to divest Intrum
Justitia’s operations in Norway and Lindorff’s businesses in Denmark, Estonia, Finland and Sweden
(the “Divestment”). The Divestment was consummated in March 2018.

**Operations and service offerings**

We divide our operations along two service lines: (i) our CMS service line, through which we offer
services along the credit management value chain, from credit optimization and payment services to
debt collection; and (ii) our Portfolio Investments service line, which includes factoring (to a limited
extent), payment guarantees, payment solutions for e-commerce companies and portfolio investments.
Our comprehensive service offering combined with our scale supports our ability to develop and
maintain strong customer relationships and collect and analyze data to gain further insight into
consumer behavior. The depth and breadth of our data assets and analytical capability is key to
promoting growth in each component of our business. For the last twelve months ended June 30, 2019,
without removing inter-service the revenue, our CMS service line accounted for 69% of consolidated
total revenues and our Portfolio Investments service line accounted for 48% of consolidated total
revenues.

The table below sets forth our revenue by service line for the periods indicated.

(1) Inter-service line total revenue relates to payment on arm’s length terms for work carried out with CMS regarding handling
and collection on our portfolio investments. Payment is made in the form of a commission that is recognized as a cost within
the Portfolio Investments service line.

**_CMS service line_**

Our CMS service line offers services throughout the credit management chain to meet the needs of our
clients, from the assessment of credit to payment and collection. Collection services generate the
greatest proportion of revenue for this service line. For the year ended December 31, 2018, collection
services accounted for 82% of credit management revenue. Our other offerings in the CMS service line
include credit information and optimization services and payment services.

_Collection services_

The primary source of revenue for the CMS service line is the provision of debt collection services to
clients when their invoices are past due, with the services being subject to guidelines chosen by the
client regarding specific procedures and settlement. As of June 30, 2019, our aggregate total collectible

122


-----

value on third-party debt was SEK 920,313 million (€87,167 million equivalent). During the debt
collection process we take into account country-specific laws and regulations and we aim in all
instances to preserve clients’ reputations. We also undertake the same debt collection processes for
our own portfolios.

In the initial stages of the debt collection process, we use our Scoring process to estimate the
creditworthiness of a group of consumers based on historical data, which allows us to anticipate their
payment habits and behaviors. See “Management Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations—Key factors affecting results of operations—Collection costs and operational_
_efficiency.” Scoring allows us to predict the likelihood that a customer will pay its debts and to tailor our_
debt collection strategies in order to efficiently collect final payments from end-customers. The process
is tailored to account for specific circumstances and behaviors and also to minimize the impact on the
customer relationship. Typically, customers are sent a letter stating that we have been instructed to
collect the claim on the client’s behalf. If the customer does not pay within a prescribed period, we
employ tailor-made strategies aimed at ensuring collection. Collection methods include telephone calls,
letters, text messages, emails and, to some extent, personal visits by agents. Via our online tools for
clients, including IntrumWeb, we provide visibility for our clients on the amount a client’s organization is
owed and the payment status in real-time. We also provide online tools to end-customers, which allow
the end-customer to update their contact information, review their outstanding payments and directly
proceed with payments on their own without needing to interact with a customer service representative.

Much of our debt collection process is standardized and automated, with the goal of maximizing the
total amount collected over the life of the debt through sustainable payment plans or affordable
settlements achieved through an amicable and solution-oriented collection approach, rather than
exploiting short-term collection potential.

We have integrated several automated processes into our debt collection process to improve efficiency
and reduce the need for manual case handling. These processes include:

- Standardized work processes: a sequence of predefined actions to occur according to a set
schedule. Standardized processes determine when our agents should telephone, send out a letter
to, text message or use another means to contact the customer.

- Campaigns: the implementation of common processes for a group of claims. Campaigns will
typically begin when we expect customers to have an enhanced ability to pay.

- Event engines: software driven processes that prescribe a series of actions to be taken in
connection with 65 different external events, such as customer bankruptcy, death or address
modification. For example, these actions could include periodic telephone calls, text messages and
other methods typically utilized in the pre-legal collection process.

- Automation: the automation of business processes through the use of advanced software. It is
effectively a virtual workforce that can carry out processes significantly faster than humans,
including selecting which customers to contact based on certain criteria and gathering information
and business intelligence across channels.

We have the ability to provide international collection services to companies engaging in international
trade in approximately 180 countries. Depending on the location of the end-customer, these services
are delivered through our network of offices or through our network of selected partners. Our network
contains partners selected through a structured on-boarding process and termination plan. Partners are
continuously monitored to ensure they meet our code of conduct.

If, after the end-customer has received assistance from us and an opportunity to pay, an amicable
collection process is unsuccessful, the matter may be forwarded to legal authorities for a decision. The
legal systems vary between countries depending on, for instance, the applicable legislation and the
local legal entities responsible for handling cases. We have established locally-adapted processes
using highly skilled staff, which may involve third parties such as courts, attorneys and bailiffs where
required.

123


-----

_Payment services_

We provide a full suite of services relating to accounts receivable, including invoicing and reminder
services. Invoices are distributed automatically and, in circumstances where customers do not pay their
bills, we offer reminder services. Using our IT capabilities and Scoring, we are able to send
individually-adapted reminders to those who have fallen behind on their payments. Our database on
end-customer payment patterns and trends enables us to adapt the design and frequency of payment
reminders to account for end-customers’ finances and thereby help to maintain strong relationships
between the customer and the client. If a client wishes to send its own invoices, we also offer a tailored
account ledger service to support clients in completing transactions with their customers.

We further offer VAT specialist services to manage clients’ VAT refund processes. We also offer VAT
consultancy, registration and compliance services, as well as tailored training packages on how to deal
with VAT issues.

_Credit information and optimization services_

We provide credit information on individuals and companies across Europe to help our clients determine
who to sell to and on what terms. As business is increasingly conducted online, a greater amount is
paid for through credit solutions such as invoicing or different installment models. Our integrated
services help our clients prevent late or non-payment. We share our insight into existing and prospective
consumers’ payment patterns so that clients can make credit decisions about the creditworthiness of
their customers on the basis of efficient and reliable information to help ensure a successful transaction
and so that consumers make transactions for which they have the capacity to pay.

Our credit risk analysis is based on Scoring, which requires advanced statistical tools and considerable
IT capacity. The overall credit risk assessment is derived from a combination of Scoring and an
understanding of human behavior, payment patterns and the market. We therefore benefit from our
long-term experience with European credit markets and our database of payment patterns in different
markets.

We also offer a monitoring service pursuant to which we monitor the performance of a client’s credit
agreements and detect and alert the client of changes that could affect their credit risk and that may
need action. This service helps clients avoid the possibility of a non-payment in the future.

**_Portfolio Investments service line_**

We offer a range of financial services and purchase portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables.
The revenue generated from returns on purchased portfolios is the primary source of revenue for this
service line. For the year ended December 31, 2018, revenue from portfolios accounted for 97% of our
Portfolio Investments service line revenue.

_Purchase of overdue receivables_

Following a thorough risk analysis assessment, we acquire portfolios of loans and other overdue
receivables for a portion of the nominal value, with the percentage depending on the quality of the debt.
Subject to certain exceptions, we then service the debt independently using our in-house debt collection
function, thereby benefiting from our expertise and economies of scale. We maintain pricing discipline
through an institutionalized investment process and a structurally embedded risk management culture,
supported by data analytics, which enables us to maintain high portfolio returns and mitigate the risk of
overbidding on portfolios. We buy written-off debt from nearly every type and size of company, including
credit institutions, private and public enterprises and government bodies, though we focus on acquiring
portfolios from known clients. Our provision of CMS, and the complementarity between collection
services and debt purchasing, places us in a strong position when seeking to purchase portfolios. In
addition to benefiting from advantages related to scale, particularly in relation to data analytics and
operational efficiencies, we have a greater understanding of the portfolios being acquired in
circumstances where we previously serviced the relevant debt and can therefore assess and price
offered portfolios more accurately. We believe our full service offering and established relationships
make us an attractive bidder for debt portfolios. For the year ended December 31, 2018, 75.3% of our
portfolio investments were from existing or previous clients.

Our core focus has been on portfolios containing consumer unsecured debt and we seek to maintain
diversified portfolios, by country and industry, helping to limit overall volatility. During 2016, we
increased the scope of our investments in purchased receivables within new adjacent asset classes by
acquiring our first major secured portfolio. In October 2016, we acquired a large portfolio from Erste
Bank of Hungary, consisting of past-due consumer loans secured by real estate. We also increased the
scope of our debt collection services for receivables with SMEs through business acquisitions, such as
the acquisition of Segestión Gabinete Tecnico Empresarial, SL in Spain and Dansk Kreditorservice A/S
in Denmark, each during the fourth quarter of 2016 and the acquisitions of Asset Gate GmbH in
Germany, Mirus International BV in the Netherlands, and Intractiv Wide Development SAS in France,
each during 2017. We believe that the provision of debt collection services improves our ability to
participate in tenders and make sound investment decisions with respect to portfolios of SME
receivables.

For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we invested SEK 1,736 million and SEK 1,450
million in forward flow agreements and for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 we invested
SEK 772 million and SEK 842 million, respectively, in forward flow arrangements. We believe that
forward flow agreements are beneficial as they provide certainty of a minimum volume of claims on
which to perform debt collection. Similarly, these agreements are beneficial to the seller as they provide
a certain level of predictability of the volume of claims being sold.

_Origination_

The majority of portfolios for sale are currently offered to the market through competitive tender
processes, although we also engage our clients in discussions to purchase portfolios through bilateral
negotiations whenever opportunities arise. A key driver of our success in debt purchasing has been our
ability to leverage our relationships with clients for whom we collect debt through outsourcing contracts.
Our local sales teams maintain close relationships with key debt originators in countries where we have
local operations. In addition, our senior management maintains close relationships on a cross-border
level with our major key debt originators and is actively involved in our largest transactions with these
sellers. Through these relationships, we often receive requests for proposals in relation to the portfolios
for sale.

_Valuation and due diligence_

We engage in an extensive valuation of any given portfolio in order to determine what price we should
offer the client. First, we look at certain characteristics, including the age of the claims in the portfolio,
the size of the portfolio, the type of receivable the portfolio contains, the characteristics of collaterals
(where applicable) and their connection to the claims, and the collection process already undertaken in
order to determine whether the portfolio is suitable. Once we have determined that a portfolio for sale
is suitable, we engage in an extensive valuation of the portfolio. Our use of multiple valuation methods
takes into account, among other factors, the below analyses:

- for the most granular portfolios we conduct vintage analysis, where we use historical cash flow
information to forecast future returns; debt profiles, where we identify the key value drivers in the
portfolio and segment the portfolio based on these key value drivers and evaluate the total likely
recovery for each claim; scorecards, where we use all available data (internal, external and client
data) to evaluate the propensity of each customer in the portfolio to pay and to what amount; and
paying books, where we identify different payment profiles and segment accounts based on historic
behavior.

- for secured loan portfolios or where claims are concentrated, in an industry or particular asset class,
we commission collateral valuations, legal case reviews (including court or bankruptcy
documentation), servicing notes review (including, for example, past or ongoing payment or
settlement agreements with debtors) and personal guarantor asset or income investigations which
either (a) can be reviewed position-by-position by an underwriter and will result in a Manual
Underwriting business plan specific to the position or (b) the information will be captured in a
position-by-position model which will augment or correct the seller-provided data (with, for example,
specific collateral values, liens, legal status, etc.) and will calculate position-by-position business
plans. Where it is not feasible or reasonable to commission reviews and valuations covering the
entirety of a portfolio, we will typically select a composition of the most valuable positions together
with a random sample; the results of these reviews and valuations (augmented with those prior

125


-----

exercises) will be fed into extrapolation models that will help adjust inputs and assumptions for the
positions that could not be reviewed. As a final validation step the investment team, together with
operations, organize sessions during which the business plan for a selection of positions is reviewed
against their inputs.

The emphasis we place on each valuation method depends on the specific circumstances, information
available and characteristics of the portfolio for sale.

In conjunction with the valuation process, we also perform due diligence on the portfolio prior to making
a final bid. The purpose of this due diligence process is to identify any areas of risk that would impact
our ability to successfully manage the portfolio following its purchase. As part of the due diligence
process, we request and work to verify certain data fields, including claim balances, payment history on
claims, details of credit agreements and legal enforceability. Additionally, we undertake a detailed
review of the assumptions that we applied as part of the valuation process and determine whether those
assumptions need to be adjusted. For certain transactions, we also engage external advisors for this
process. We seek to leverage our relationships with clients to assist us with this process by obtaining
guidance on pricing, where possible.

We believe that we have a competitive advantage when we are invited to bid on a portfolio that we
perform debt collection on because we are able to accurately assess the potential uplift that can be
generated given our familiarity with the debt collection measures that have been undertaken, allowing
us to accurately price the portfolio. This results in being able to confidently offer an attractive value
proposition to clients, which makes us a strong contender for portfolios that we finds attractive.

_Offer_

Depending on the size of the transaction, the assessment and final pricing of a portfolio involves input
from our country-level management and operations, our debt purchasing and debt collection teams, our
IT team and senior executives. This group works together to use the information gathered in the process
to prepare the final bid, and the relevant country level team uses its knowledge and expertise to provide
a current and accurate reflection on the competitive environment in order to ensure that any final bid is
aligned with the competing offers the client is likely to receive. The final bid is determined based on an
analysis of various scenarios, which are designed to test our models at the high and low ends of prior
experience, and is evaluated and approved by pre-defined levels of management, depending on the
size of the bid. The final price that we offer for a portfolio takes into account the return that we require
to compensate for the risk present in the transaction, the possibility that actual performance of the
portfolio may deviate from the expected performance and the level of competition that we face in the
market.

We believe that a key driver of our success in debt purchasing is due to our ability to leverage our
relationships with clients. We use these relationships to engage in a dialogue with the client in order to
help us putting together a competitive bid. These relationships can also be used to propose alternative
structures to those that were requested if we believe it will create value for us and the client. We also
frequently receive a “first and last look opportunity” at a portfolio due to these pre-existing relationships.

_Contract and closing_

For the majority of our portfolio purchases, clients receive a one-off cash payment. However, we also
offer different pricing models in an effort to address specific needs or desires of our clients. One such
alternative pricing model is an “earn-out model,” which provides for profit sharing, where the client
receives an upfront cash payment for the portfolio based on an initial forecast and then receives a
percentage of any gains above the initial forecast.

_Implementation_

After purchasing a portfolio, if we do not already perform debt collection on the purchased portfolio, we
must ensure that claim balances are accurately recorded, funds paid between the determination date
and the closing date by customers are received, and customers are diverted to the appropriate phase
of the collection process. We also screen individual claims against various databases to determine
whether any of the individual claims do not meet the specified criteria and should be returned, if
contractually permitted. If we already service the purchased portfolio, the risks associated with the

126


-----

conversion process are minimized, since many of these steps have already been undertaken as part of
our debt collection services.

_Contact and collection process_

After acquiring a portfolio, we typically manage the portfolio in-house. Our deep insight of the debt
collection process enables us to tailor customized approaches for each customer and to determine
whether we can extract additional value from a customer and uplift on a portfolio by applying different
collection methods than were used previously. By typically servicing purchased portfolios in-house, we
also provide stability and scale to the debt collection segment of our business, which allows us to
improve and enhance our debt collection methods.

_Co-investment_

We also partner and co-invest with financial investors that lack debt collection capabilities and with
banks that prefer to outsource such services and to deconsolidate non-performing assets.
Co-investment is beneficial as it provides us with a large portfolio on which to perform debt collection
through master servicing agreements, while it also generates portfolio income for us proportionate to
our economic interest. As of June 30, 2019, 3% of the portfolio investments book value consisted of our
share of portfolios purchased pursuant to consolidated co-investments and our net investment in
co-investments in which we do not have a controlling position, and are therefore not consolidated in the
Issuer’s Financial Statements, amounted to €2,435 million. See “Material contracts, acquisitions and
_mergers”._

**Business intelligence**

The characteristics of the credit management and financial services markets provide a competitive
advantage to participants with the strongest data assets and analytical capabilities. Our database of
businesses and credit information on markets, consumer groups and companies provides the basis for
assessing credit risk, offering individually tailored payment plans, collecting on overdue debt, offering
e-commerce services and valuing overdue receivables. Each of these services helps to ensure that our
clients get paid and their customers become debt-free.

We believe that our data assets and analytical capabilities enable us to proactively assess portfolios
and that our data sets and analytical capabilities were enhanced by the Merger. Companies that only
purchase portfolios typically have less data on customers and associated payment trends until a
portfolio is purchased, when the specific customers in the portfolio can be matched to a credit
referencing agency database. In addition, customer files in a portfolio may contain inaccurate or
incomplete information on the name, address or telephone number of the customer, which can make it
difficult to locate the customer or otherwise complicate the debt collection process. For competitors that
do not have experience in debt collection, this may result in data asymmetry in valuing portfolios prior
to purchase and through the collection process.

**Geographic presence**

As of June 30, 2019, we have operations in 25 countries, divided into four regions: Northern Europe
(Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden), Central Europe (Austria, the
Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Switzerland), Western
Europe (Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK) and Iberian Peninsula and Latin
America (Brazil, Portugal and Spain).

The table below sets forth the revenue from external clients in each of the regions in which we have
operations for the periods indicated.

(1) Data is extracted from the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018.
(2) Northern Europe includes Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden.
(3) Central and Eastern Europe includes Greece, Poland, Romania, Switzerland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Germany,
Hungary and Austria.

(4) Western and Southern Europe includes Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.
(5) Iberian Peninsula and Latin America includes Spain, Portugal and Brazil.
(6) In the third quarter of 2018, the composition of our geographic regions was updated so that, going forward, operations in
Spain, Portugal and Brazil were reported in the “Iberian Peninsula and Latin America” region. Prior to the reorganization,
our Portuguese operations were reported in the “Western and Southern Europe” region. For all periods in the above table
other than the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, amounts have been reflected based on our new reporting convention
for geographic splits such that our Portuguese operations are included in the “Iberian Peninsula and Latin America” region.
Such amounts are based on the geographic splits in the notes to our financial statements (including revised comparative
period amounts taking into account the above change). For the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, total revenue from
external clients by geographical region for each component period is not available on the basis of the new reporting
convention. As a result, for the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 in the table above, “Western and Southern Europe”
includes revenue from Portugal and “Iberian Peninsula and Latin America” does not include revenue from Portugal and as
such are not directly comparable to the other periods presented.

We have selectively pursued potential acquisitions and carve-out transactions to expand our geographic
footprint. For further information on our historical expansion, see “—History” and “—Material Contracts,
_Acquisitions and Mergers.” Additionally, we work closely with trusted agents around the world to perform_
international debt collection. We have partnerships with representatives in approximately 180 countries
to assist clients with operations both within Europe and beyond.

**Clients**

We have approximately 80,000 clients, operating in virtually all sectors, though with a focus on
telecommunications companies, energy companies, financial institutions and companies in the retail
sector. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our 20 largest clients accounted for 6% of our revenues.

While we are particularly strong among clients with large volumes of consumer receivables, we also
work with thousands of small, entrepreneurial companies and medium-sized companies that have
chosen to focus on their core operations rather than on credit management.

**Material contracts, acquisitions and mergers**

_Aktua_

In June 2016, Lindorff Iberia Holding, S.L.U., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Lindorff Holding
Spain, acquired 93.66% of the shares in Aktua from a vehicle of Centerbridge Partners LP, and other
minority shareholders. Aktua is a servicing company providing mainly secured NPL services and real
estate servicing in Spain. In July 2016, Lindorff’s ownership interest in Aktua decreased to
approximately 85% as minority interest shareholder Banco Santander acquired an additional 8.66% of
Lindorff’s shares. Banco Santander has a put option right against Lindorff Iberia, in respect of its 15%
stake in Aktua, for a circumstance-dependent strike price.

On March 10, 2016, prior to the Aktua Acquisition, Aktua acquired Ibercaja Group’s servicer, Gestión
de Inmuebles Salduvia, S.A (later renamed Aktua Soluciones Inmobiliarias, S.L). The transaction also
included the execution of a ten-year servicing agreement in relation to the management, on an exclusive
basis, of certain real estate assets of the Ibercaja Group.

_Top Factoring SRL_

In April 2017, we acquired Top Factoring SRL, one of the leading companies for portfolio investments
in Romania. The acquisition price was €25.7 million, the majority of which was attributed to a portfolio
of overdue receivables held by Top Factoring SRL’s parent company.

_IJCOF Corporate SAS_

In April 2017, we acquired the remaining 42% of the shares in IJCOF Corporate SAS for €8.9 million,
after having acquired a 58% stake in December 2013. IJCOF Corporate SAS provides corporate
collection operations in France.

_1st Credit_

In February 2017, we completed our acquisition of the entire share capital of 1st Credit, a UK company
offering debt collection services. The purchase price on a cash and debt free basis was £130 million,
attributable to a diversified portfolio of receivables, deriving from investments from several sellers in the
financial industry.

_The Merger and the Divestment_

In June 2017, the EC approved Intrum Justitia’s merger with Lindorff, which completed in the end of
June 2017. The approval was conditional on the divestment of the Carveout Business. On November
2, 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement with Lowell, a European credit receivables management
company, to divest the Carveout Business. The Carveout Business was sold for a purchase price
consideration of SEK 7,511 million. In connection with the Divestment, we entered into three-year brand
licensing agreements with Lowell for the “Lindorff” brand in Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Estonia and
the “Intrum Justitia” brand in Norway. The Divestment was consummated on March 20, 2018.

_CAF S.p.A. and related portfolio_

In December 2017, we completed the acquisition of CAF S.p.A, the third-largest credit management
company for impaired unsecured receivables in Italy. CAF employs approximately 200 employees over
three locations in Italy. In connection with the acquisition of CAF, we acquired from the sellers a large,
diversified unsecured receivables portfolio, the collection on which is performed by CAF. The total
purchase consideration for CAF and the portfolio was €200 million, on a cash and debt-free basis.

_Banca Intesa Sanpaolo_

In November 2018, we entered into a partnership agreement with the Italian bank Intesa Sanpaolo,
pursuant to which Intesa Sanpaolo contributed its service platform for overdue receivables, consisting
of a collection department with a labor force of 600, and we contributed all of our Italian operations at
the time (other than Cross Factor SpA and the holding company Lindorff Italy Srl). As a result of the
agreement, we own a 51% interest in the shared Italian collection business, Intrum Italy S.p.A., and
therefore consolidate its results of operations, with the minority share attributable to Intesa Sanpaolo
reported as a non-controlling interest. Intrum Italy S.p.A. also entered into a 10-year exclusive servicing
agreement with Intesa Sanpaolo for the vast majority of the bank’s new NPL inflow during this period.
As part of the partnership agreement, Intesa Sanpaolo also contributed a portfolio of overdue
receivables (mainly consisting of covered loans) to a jointly-owned platform. Along with CarVal
Investors, our co-investment partner, we own 80% of the capital of the Intesa JV, which in turn owns
51% of the jointly-owned platform.

The Intesa JV is subject, by agreement, to controlling influence shared by Intrum and CarVal Investors
and we therefore report our interest in the jointly owned platform as a participation in a joint venture.
The Intesa JV has invested in junior notes and mezzanine loans issued by the jointly-owned platform,
Penelope. Penelope has invested in overdue receivables acquired from Banca Intesa Sanpaolo.
Penelope also controls the property company, Savoy Reoco S.R.L., which assumes control of seized
collateral in the form of properties. See “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
_and Results of Operations—Acquisitions, geographic expansion and divestments” and “Management_
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Participations in joint_
_ventures—Ithaca Investment DAC.”_

_Ibercaja Banco SA_

In December 2018, we reached an agreement to purchase 6,400 properties in Spain from Ibercaja. The
properties were transferred to a new company, of which we were initially an 80% shareholder and
Residential Murillo S.A., a subsidiary of Ibercaja is a 20% shareholder. In February 2019, we divested
to a co-investor 50% of our shares in the new company. Following the divestment, our investment
amounts to SEK 347 million and we report our interest in the new company as a participation in a joint
venture.

_Solvia Servicios Inmobiliaros_

In April 2019, we acquired from Banco Sabadell 80% of the bank’s wholly owned subsidiary Solvia,
which offers real estate management services in the Spanish market, for a purchase price of €241
million.

_Piraeus Partnership_

In June 2019, we announced our entry into the Piraeus Partnership, a long-term strategic partnership
with Piraeus Bank. Under this agreement we agreed to acquire 80% of Piraeus Bank’s Recovery
Banking Unit in combination with a long-term non-performing exposures servicing agreement through
a newly formed company, establishing a strategic partnership in the Greek NPL servicing market.
Piraeus Bank will own the remaining 20% of the newly formed company’s shares. The current gross
book value of the portfolios that will be subject to the servicing agreement exceeds €28 billion. The
purchase price corresponding to the acquisition of 80% of the shares in the new company will be €328
million, of which only €296 million will be payable upon closing the transaction, with the remainder
expected to be paid after year end 2022. The purchase price will be funded through existing facilities.
The Piraeus Partnership represents a significant entry for us into the Greek market and will result in us
holding a market leading position in Greece. The completion of the transaction will be subject to certain
conditions, including customary regulatory approval, and is anticipated to complete in the fourth quarter
of 2019.

**Compliance and quality control**

We view the effective monitoring and management of significant risks, including investment risk, to be
critical to protecting our reputation and value. Within our risk management framework, all of our
employees assume responsibility for managing the economic, reputational and compliance risks faced
by the company as part of their regular work duties. In addition, our risk management and compliance
approach involves an independent external risk control function that serves as both an active participant
in important transactional processes, a monitor in connection with the auditing of risk management and
compliance activities and a strategic advisor in connection with establishing our risk appetite and
compliance policies.

The Chief Risk Officer is the executive responsible for managing our risk management and compliance
programs, and the Chief Risk Officer reports directly to our President and has direct access to our
board.

**Employees, recruiting and training**

As of December 31, 2018, we have approximately 9,000 FTEs. The majority of our employees are
actively involved in providing service to our CMS clients and claims management for our portfolio
investments. With the objective of attracting, developing and retaining talented employees, we employ
tools aimed at enhancing expertise and leadership capacity among employees and managers. In 2017,
we launched the Next Generation Program, our first trainee program, to attract, develop and retain
younger skilled employees. Trainees in the Next Generation Program work in various departments,
build networks and develop professionally. In 2018, we welcomed ten employees from various
European jurisdictions into this program.

The table below sets forth the average number of FTEs, including temporary employees, we had in
each of our local operations for the year ended December 31, 2018.

We believe that we have positive relations with our employees and the applicable unions and work
councils. Some of our employees are unionized. We meet with the unions and work councils on an
annual basis to update them on the direction of the business and to address any concerns that they
may have.

_Business services_

We operate Lindorff Business Services (“LBS”) in Vilnius, Lithuania. LBS is an in-house center of
excellence that supports us by providing back-office type services to improve efficiency, quality of
services and market responsiveness and to utilize scale and skill advantages, consolidate functions
and further develop knowledge sharing within Intrum.

**Legal and administrative proceedings**

As we have expansive operations across several jurisdictions, we are frequently subject to disputes,
claims and administrative proceedings, many of which arise in the ordinary course of business. These
can include disputes regarding VAT, interest cost deductions, intra-group loan pricing or a variety of
other matters, particularly relating to tax. Other than as discussed below, we have not been party to any
governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings (including any such proceedings which are pending or
threatened of which we are aware) during the previous 12 months from the date of this Offering
Memorandum which may have, or have had in the recent past, significant effects on our financial
position or profitability.

We are party to disputes relating to the acquisition and management of Buckaroo BV, despite having
divested our shares in Buckaroo BV in 2017. In January 2012, we acquired Buckaroo from its former
shareholders through our Dutch subsidiary. After certain unlawful behavior was detected, we replaced
Buckaroo BV’s management and became subject to a number of proceedings relating to earn-out
provisions. All claims brought by certain former shareholders and management have been dismissed
and there is no further opportunity to appeal. A risk remains however that the former shareholders will
continue to claim payment pursuant to earn-out provisions that may entitle them to an aggregate of €28
million. A provision of €4 million has been made in our accounts as of June 30, 2019.

Following the purchase of Casus Finanse S.A. by Lindorff and the subsequent calculation of the
carve-out, the vendors (and former management) of Casus Finanse S.A. disputed Lindorff’s calculation
of nil as the earn-out amount owing to the vendors under the purchase agreement. The vendors
presented an alternative calculation, indicating an earn-out amount of approximately €15.3 million.
Having received a second opinion from an audit firm supporting our calculations, our position is that no

131


-----

entitlement to an additional purchase consideration or remuneration for continued employment applies.
In connection with the acquisition of Casus Finanse S.A., a conditional bonus of €4.4 million was
payable to the former management, with 50% due upon closing and the remaining 50% due upon
continuous employment of the former managers until a certain point in time. The former management
was dismissed as of December 1, 2016. Intrum’s position is that the €2.2 million of the conditional bonus
paid on closing should be repaid, and as a result of the dismissal the remaining 50% of the bonus shall
not be paid. The dispute has been referred to an arbitration board, which requested an expert opinion
in 2018 and is expected to announce its ruling in the second half of 2019. A provision of €8.5 million
has been made in our accounts as of June 30, 2019.

Further, there are several disputes with the former CEO and CFO of one of our Spanish subsidiaries
regarding unlawful dismissals, exit bonus payment pursuant to group bonus agreements, salary claims
pursuant to local bonus agreements and claims regarding non-compete compensation. After certain
unauthorized activities were detected, the CEO and CFO were dismissed in 2016, after which they
brought forward the various claims in 2017. The Criminal Court of Madrid has issued a preliminary
ruling, in which it is stated that the CEO and CFO in relation to Intrum “incurred unjustified expenses
and misappropriated more than €3.5 million”. If the preliminary ruling is upheld (it has been appealed),
formal prosecution charges may be brought against the CEO and CFO, which we believe will likely have
a positive effect for Intrum in the civil cases against them. The Spanish Supreme Court has rejected the
CEO’s and CFO’s appeals regarding unlawful dismissals, and these cases have now been closed. It is
our expectation that this will have a positive impact on the claims regarding exit bonus payments and
salary claims, which are still outstanding, but the lower courts have not yet acted on the ruling of the
Spanish Supreme Court. The total amounts claimed under the disputes amount to around €10.2 million.
A provision of €0.9 million has been made in our accounts as of June 30, 2019.

**Insurance**

We maintain comprehensive insurance policies with respect to, among other things, business
interruptions, professional indemnity, directors’ and officers’ liability and property damage. We believe
that our insurance coverage is in accordance with that of other similar companies and is adequate for
our needs.

**Real property**

Our headquarters is located in Stockholm, Sweden but we coordinate local operations within each of
the countries in which we offer services through properties located in these countries. We lease our
headquarters and primarily lease the other properties from which we offer services.

**Intellectual property**

While we hold various trademarks and have registered several domain names, no individual or series
of trademarks or intellectual property is material to our business as a whole.

**Sustainability and social responsibility promote a sound economy**

Our objective is to create the conditions for a sound economy, which we believe includes being
environmentally and socially conscious. When credit assessments and payment flows function as they
should, companies are paid. This allows companies to be more profitable, to develop, to grow and to
recruit more employees. At the same time, we help people become debt-free and to achieve sound
private finances. It is in helping others achieve a sound economic situation, which in turn is a
fundamental element of society’s overall sustainability efforts, that we can make our greatest impact.

We have taken a number of concrete steps toward this goal. For example, over the years we have taken
an active role in policy development by frequent lobbying in Brussels. Additionally, since 1998, we have
conducted Europe’s largest survey on payment habits and commissioned written reports thereon. The
most recent report demonstrated the need for countries, governments, businesses and consumers to
establish efficient payment flows throughout Europe. In general, we endeavor to improve consumer
skills in private finance by helping consumers understand the importance of spending responsibly and
the risks associated with high indebtedness. We are committed to providing the greatest possible
benefits for clients through offering a comprehensive range of services.

We have developed three general focal points that drive our sustainability and social responsibility
efforts moving forward: (i) enabling sustainable payments, (ii) being a trusted and respected industry
actor and (iii) growing by making a difference.

_Enabling sustainable payments: we believe that in ensuring that our interactions with clients and that_
the services that we provide to our client’s customers are founded upon our four core values of empathy,
ethics, dedication and solutions, we can, as a market leader, influence the development of the credit
management industry in an ethical and sustainable direction, in turn enabling sustainable payment flows
through which our clients receive payments and end-customers become debt free.

_Being a trusted and respected industry actor: we believe that the integration of good business ethics_
throughout our operations and value chain is key to our being a trusted and respected actor within the
industry. Following the Merger, we consolidated the Intrum Justitia and Lindorff internal regulations to
form our new Code of Conduct. A key facet of being a trusted and respected actor, which is reflected
in our Code of Conduct, is our commitment to conducting our business, and treating all of our client’s
customers, with respect and consideration. We are in the process of providing each of our employees
with Code of Conduct training. Through our environmental instructions, in connection with our Code of
Conduct, we work to reduce our environmental and climate impact and we further endeavor to protect
the personal data of the individuals with whom we deal by handling sensitive information in a manner
that guarantees their personal integrity is respected. enabling a sustainable future for coming
generations.

_Growing by making a difference: through our third focal point we strive to be the most attractive_
employer in the sector by offering meaningful and stimulating work with strong opportunities to develop,
grow and make a difference in the communities in which our employees work. It is important to us that
all of our employees are treated respectfully and are afforded equal opportunities for development. With
a presence in 25 markets we believe that diversity is an important asset and that through increased
diversity we can be responsive to efforts to help people get out of debt and understand people’s
individual situations.

**_Education_**

We educate society on how credit and defaults affect individuals and companies. Since 1998, we have
conducted an annual study of payment behaviors in Europe, the results of which we disseminate
through the European Payment Report. We have conducted an annual study of European consumers’
payment behavior since 2013, published in our European Consumer Payment report. These reports
provide information on the effects of late payments on companies and what European consumers’
everyday finances look like. For example, in the European Payment Report 2019, the result shows that
30% of companies report having liquidity problems due to late payments. Of the companies surveyed,
12% say that late payments cause them to consider dismissing staff and 18% say that late payments
mean they do not dare recruit more employees. Data from the reports is used by clients,
decision-makers at the EU and local levels and media. The surveys provide guidance for the European
Commission in developing and evaluating the EU directive on late payments and we were the only
commercial actor invited to participate in the European Commission’s effort to implement the directive
in 2013 and 2014.

We have also undertaken a number of initiatives at the local level. In 2016, we launched Spendido in
Sweden, an interactive web lesson on household economy, with a focus on credit. The lesson
constitutes a tool for high school teachers to illuminate the consequences of buying on credit. Within
this framework, our employees hold lessons in upper secondary school classes about what buying on
credit entails, what the cost is when someone fails to pay and what happens once an invoice has been
passed on for debt collection. We work proactively with 10 similar education initiatives across Europe
in Germany, the United Kingdom and Hungary amongst others. The Global Compact: UN ten principles
for sustainable enterprises.

In April 2016, we signed the United Nations (“UN”) Global Compact, the ten principles for sustainable
enterprise developed by the UN. Signing the Global Compact means that we voluntarily commit to: (a)
conducting our operations in a responsible manner, in line with the ten principles of sustainability; (b)
taking steps to support the communities in which we operate; (c) establishing commitment at the highest
levels of our company (the board of directors and senior management), and making sustainability work

133


-----

part of our DNA; (d) preparing an annual report on our progress; and (e) engaging in sustainability
issues locally. We submitted our third report to the UN in April 2019.

**_Environmental sustainability_**

We are committed to making efforts to directly benefit the environment, such as by prioritizing video
meetings over travel, owning a vehicle fleet consisting of cars that emit less than 130 grams of carbon
dioxide in accordance with emissions directives from the EU and using office materials efficiently.

**REGULATORY OVERVIEW**

As a multinational credit management provider, we are subject to various laws and regulations in the
jurisdictions in which we operate. The credit management industry is highly influenced by legislation,
judicial rulings and regulatory decisions and oversight. Credit management companies additionally must
comply with various licensing, registration and other similar requirements in order to operate their
businesses. As a result, our financial condition and projections are susceptible to changes in the
regulatory environment.

For a description of certain material effects of laws and regulations on our business, see “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to Our Industry and Business—We operate in a variety of jurisdictions and must comply_
_with applicable laws, regulations, licenses and codes of practice across all jurisdictions. Changes to the_
_regulatory or political environments in which we operate may negatively affect our business.”_

**Regulation of the credit management industry**

Legislative, judicial and regulatory decisions affect us in a number of different ways. This overview will
highlight key areas of regulatory focus that have affected, and will continue to affect, our operations:
fair debt collection practices, statutes of limitations, enhanced consumer protection, consumer credit
development, corporate social responsibility, data protection and anti-money laundering regimes.

**_Fair debt collection practices_**

As debt collection regulation is not based on specific EU legislation, it is not possible to make use of a
passporting or similar regime. Instead, each country has developed its own set of rules for debt
collection operations. The regulations cover, among other things: the methods by which claims can be
assigned or transferred; the ways in which a customer can be contacted and a debt collected; and the
types and level of fees, interests and costs that can be imposed, and whether those fees, interests and
costs can be passed to the customer or the client.

In countries where there are no specific regulations covering debt collection and where no licensing
requirements apply for certain debt collection operations, there are still regulations of a more general
nature which we must observe when carrying out our debt collection operations. Such regulations
include, for example, general civil and commercial rules and consumer protection laws and regulations
regarding caps on collection fees and interest costs. In addition, in a number of markets in which we
operate, the reimbursement of costs for debt collection is limited by law. Any regulatory changes
reducing the amount of such costs we can recover may have a negative impact on our results of
operations.

In many of the countries in which our operations are licensed or regulated, our subsidiaries are subject
to certain integrity tests with respect to debt collection. These integrity tests may include verifying that:
the collection business is carried out in accordance with local rules and regulations; consumer lending
operations are conducted in accordance with sound lending practices; the directors of the board have
sufficient knowledge and experience and have not misused any debt collection permissions; and the
directors meet other general suitability and reliability checks.

**_Statutes of limitations_**

Rules regarding the length of time after which an unpaid debt may not be pursued by creditors and the
ways in which the statute of limitations can be tolled so that a debt can remain collectible also vary
across jurisdictions. In a majority of the countries in which we operate, it is possible to extend the
statutes of limitation on historic debt claims indefinitely by using various methods, including enforcement
actions, notification of the customer or otherwise interrupting the limitation period with continued court
proceedings. Some of the countries in which we operate have in recent years changed the statutes of
limitation for certain debt including by limiting the ability to extend or interrupt the limitation period, or
have discussed doing so. We constantly monitor any changes in these rules in the countries in which
we operate, and, where appropriate, implement local procedures to interrupt the limitations period. Any
significant reduction in the statute of limitations or in the ability to toll the statute of limitations, and any
failure to implement local procedures to interrupt the limitations periods, would negatively impact our
operations.

135


-----

**_Enhanced consumer protection_**

There has been a trend in recent years to afford more protection to consumers. Various laws,
regulations and judicial decisions in jurisdictions in which we operate have changed the way we operate
and some have negatively impacted our financial condition. For example, a few countries have
proposed giving bailiffs the right to provide services in the pre-legal market, including the right to
purchase debts and perform voluntary collections. We are currently assessing the impact of these
proposals on the relevant subsidiaries and are closely involved in the legislative processes.

Consumer protection laws can limit our ability to enforce debt claims. For example, in Finland, the
enforcement of a consumer debt claim in the event of a default by the customer is subject to restrictions,
such as a minimum period of time having passed since the payment due date and a minimum proportion
of the debt remaining outstanding. Further, enforcement is prohibited if the payment default of the
consumer customer is due to social force majeure, such as illness or unemployment, or other
circumstance beyond the customer’s control, unless it would be perceptibly unreasonable to the creditor
in the circumstances. Similar laws exist in other jurisdictions in which we operate.

Certain countries in which we have operations have taken steps to facilitate debt restructuring by
individuals, whereby a payment plan for all outstanding indebtedness is initiated. After making all
payments pursuant the payment plan, the customer is no longer liable to pay any of the debt included
in the debt reconstruction. In Sweden, a new Debt Reconstruction Act (Sw. Skuldsaneringslag
_2016:675) came into effect on November 1, 2016, under which eligible customers are allowed a_
payment plan shorter than the normal five years. In Norway, a debt reconstruction may involve either a
delay in payment of all or part of a debt; the creditors waiving, in whole or in part, their claims on interest
or fees; and/or the customer no longer being liable to pay the debt after a particular period of time.

Other jurisdictions have taken measures to impose moratoriums on collections procedures under
certain conditions or offer other collections solutions to those in debt. In 2013, the Spanish Act for the
Support of Entrepreneurs introduced an out-of-court payment arrangement proceeding (Sp. acuerdo
_extrajudicial de pagos) in the Spanish Insolvency Act, available to natural and legal persons meeting_
certain requirements (such as having liabilities which do not exceed €5 million and having sufficient
assets to meet the expenses of the out-of-court payment arrangement). A customer unable to meet its
payment obligations may apply for this procedure and a mediator will be appointed. Among other things,
the opening of the out-of-court payment arrangement procedure will stay enforcement of claims over
assets of the debtor for a maximum of three months, except under certain circumstances, and suspend
the accrual of interest during the negotiation period and for a maximum of three months. Payment
agreements may include the assignment of certain assets of the debtor for payment of the debt, a
reduction of debt, moratoriums of up to ten years or a conversion of debt into equity or into profit
participative loans with a term of up to ten years. Creditors may suggest changes to the proposed
agreement, which is subject to a majority vote by creditors and may therefore be imposed on dissenting
unsecured creditors. If the out-of-court procedure does not succeed, the mediator must immediately file
for the customer’s insolvency and will be appointed as the insolvency administrator. In the Netherlands,
a so-called ‘broad moratorium’ came recently into force that provides for a temporary cooling off period
for the customer to achieve a more stable financial situation.

Customers may also become subject to insolvency proceedings which may result in a delay or
prevention in the enforcement of the claims transferred to us, including reductions in principal or interest.
Collection of unsecured claims in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency is generally limited by means
of the funds available for distribution from the insolvent estate.

**_Consumer credit development_**

Consumer credit operations have received increased regulatory attention in many of the jurisdictions in
which we operate. Some countries have imposed caps on interest rates or total cost of credit and further
regulated consumer loans with small principal values. Other countries have targeted particular types of
consumer credit agreements. In the Netherlands, a Supreme Court ruling in June 2014 held that
telecom consumers party to an agreement in which a “free” phone is provided are protected by certain
laws and regulations relating to payments by instalments and consumer credit.

Another pronounced effect of this enhanced focus on consumer credit has been to increase the scope
of which entities must hold a consumer credit license. In reaction to a recent European Court of Justice

136


-----

case, Verein für Konsumenteninformation v INKO, Inkasso GmbH, that held debt collection companies
were credit intermediaries and thus not required to provide pre-contractual information to consumers,
many countries took legislative action to impose a requirement on debt collection companies to register
with the local authority or obtain a consumer credit license. Stricter regulations in general may increase
the compliance burden and operating costs.

**_Corporate social responsibility_**

We commit to pursuing broader social and environmental goals in addition to our business objectives.
As a result, company time and resources are spent for charitable purposes, to undertake initiatives to
serve our communities, to decrease our environmental footprint and to assess and produce reports on
our progress toward these goals. In April 2016 Intrum Justitia chose to sign the United Nations (“UN”)
Global Compact, the ten principles for sustainable enterprise developed by the UN, by which it formally
committed to a number of principles of sustainability. Specifically, the Global Compact means that we
will commit to: (a) conducting our operations in a responsible manner, in line with the ten principles of
sustainability; (b) taking steps to support the communities in which we operate; (c) establishing
commitment at the highest level (the board of directors and senior management) and making
sustainability work part of the company’s DNA; (d) preparing an annual report on our progress; and (e)
engaging the company in sustainability issues locally. Intrum Justitia submitted its first report to the UN
in April 2017.

**_Data protection_**

We process personal data in our business, both when providing debt collection services and
undertaking debt purchasing. As of May 25, 2018, the processing of personal data by companies
established within the EU is governed by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679)
(“GDPR”). Similar laws are in place in Norway and Switzerland. Although based on a directive, the
national data protection laws are not identical; therefore slightly different requirements may apply to
each of our subsidiaries within the EU. The requirements include that personal data may only be
collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and may only be processed in a manner
consistent with these purposes. Further, personal data must be adequate, relevant and not excessive
in relation to the purposes for which it is collected and/or processed and it must not be kept for a longer
period of time than necessary for the purposes of the collection. In several jurisdictions, however, the
local anti-money laundering legislation requires that the financial undertakings store data obtained in
relation to customer due diligence for five years after the closure of a customer relationship or five years
after a transaction has been executed, regardless of whether the storage is considered necessary.

We are also subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in each country where we
operate. To comply with regulatory requirements, we have established data protection processes,
including having in place data protection policies, information security policies, data retention policies
and procedures for handling data subject requests. Furthermore, many jurisdictions in which we operate
require that we acquire a license from, or register with, the local data protection authority.

The GDPR contains several opening clauses, whereby EU Member States may enact specific national
rules in specified areas. In Sweden, national rules have been implemented in the Swedish Act on
Supplementary Provisions to the EU Data Protection Regulation (Sw. Lag (2018:218) med
_kompletterande bestämmelser till EU:s dataskyddsförordning) (the “Act”). The Act contains provisions_
regarding, inter alia, the processing of certain categories of personal data. In addition to the Act, the
Swedish Regulation regarding Supplementary Provisions to the EU Data Protection Regulation
(Sw. Förordning med kompletterande bestämmelser till EU:s dataskyddsförordning) (the “Regulation”)
is applicable. The Regulation stipulates, _inter alia, that the Swedish Data Protection Authority is the_
supervisory authority under the GDPR and the Act.

It is not yet fully clear how the EU Member States in which we operate will make use of these opening
clauses, and how this might affect our business. We expect the data protection policies of our entities
outside of the EU to largely be in line with the GDPR by the time of its entry into force. Norway has
already directly implemented the GDPR through the Norwegian Act of Data Protection of 2018. The Act
also contains certain national provisions regarding, inter alia, the processing of certain categories of
personal data. In Switzerland, legislation is being considered that would update data protection law to
be more consistent with EU law. In the U.K., it is not yet clear what impact the announced exit from the
EU will have on our data protection responsibilities, including with respect to length of time such data

137


-----

may be retained, whether such data must stay within the U.K. and how transfers of personal data to
and from the U.K. will be protected. However, all of our entities, including any in the U.K., will be included
in the our Company-wide GDPR Program, as further described below, to ensure the data protection
policies across all of our entities are harmonious.

The GDPR significantly changes the EU data protection landscape, including strengthening of
individuals’ rights, stricter requirements on companies processing personal data and stricter sanctions
with administrative fines up to €20 million or, in the case of undertakings, 4% of the total worldwide
annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. GDPR also offers data subjects
the option to let a privacy organization litigate on their behalf, including collecting the potential damages.
We have established a data protection project team, with representatives from the compliance, IT,
operations and legal departments, and on March 22, 2019, we adopted a new data privacy policy to
ensure compliance with the GDPR. We will continue to implement the GDPR requirements and further
enhance awareness, governance and controls of data protection procedures throughout our operations.
This will ensure that our data protection policies are effective and applied consistently going forward.

**_Anti-money laundering_**

As part of certain operations, especially debt purchasing and financing operations, we follow anti-money
laundering and countering terrorist financing standards set forth in the applicable local laws
implementing Directive (EU) 2005/60/EC on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the
purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing. Our operations are also subject to requirements
of local anti-money laundering laws.

On May 20, 2015, Directive (EU) 2015/849 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the
purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing, amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, and
repealing Directive 2005/60/EC (the “4th AML Directive”) was adopted by the European Parliament
and the Council. The 4th AML Directive enhances the current client due diligence requirements and
also imposes stricter sanctions with administrative fines of at least €5,000,000 or 10% of total annual
turnover. The 4th AML directive directs all EU Member States to transpose the directive into local law
by June 2017. To ensure compliance with the 4th AML directive, we have established a
specifically-designed initiative, the AML Project, and appointed a group AML officer to monitor
transposition of the 4th AML Directive, coordinate implementation of required solutions for new client
due diligence measures and ensure ongoing monitoring of clients and their transactions. We are also
in the process of enhancing the client screening against sanctions lists by implementing advanced IT
solutions as part of the AML Project objectives.

Directive (EU) 2018/843 (the “5[th] AML Directive”), amending the 4[th] AML Directive, was adopted by
the European Parliament and the Council on May 30, 2018 and shall be transposed into the local laws
of EU members by January 10, 2020. We last approved a new AML policy on March 11, 2019 and we
continue to monitor the implementation of the 5[th] AML Directive by EU Member States.

**_Regulatory licenses debt collection_**

In several of the countries where we operate and provide debt collection services, debt collection is a
regulated area and companies providing such services are subject to licensing or registration
requirements. In these countries, the entity offering debt collection services has a license issued by, or
is otherwise registered with, the relevant local authority. Although the relevant local authority varies by
jurisdiction, normally it is the national financial supervisory authority, police commissioner, data
inspection authority, regional state administrative agency or, in some cases, the national association
for debt collection companies.

**_Portfolio investments_**

Our debt purchasing operations in certain subsidiaries subjects us to various licensing, registration and
permit regimes. Many jurisdictions deem debt purchasing as a financial undertaking or as providing
credit services, and thus require debt purchasing companies to obtain approval from a local authority
in order to operate their businesses. As these regulations are not based on EU legislation, each country
has developed its own requirements relating to the investment in debt portfolios. In some cases, our
entity is licensed as a financial undertaking by the local financial supervisory authority for purchasing
debt portfolios from financial institutions and is required to hold a type of bank or credit license for its

138


-----

debt purchasing operations. In some jurisdictions, purchasing performing mortgages portfolios could
trigger certain requirements, such as having to obtain a credit license, comply with AML measures or
maintain a certain level of civil liability insurance.

Many countries specifically regulate the assignment of debt claims to other parties. For example, in
Norway, such contracts can only be assigned without consent of the debtor to other financial institutions.
Further, the transfer of a loan portfolio is subject to the Norwegian regulator’s consent if the portfolio is
of significance for any of the involved entities. Additionally, some jurisdictions make it more difficult for
factoring contracts to be assigned. In most of the jurisdictions in which we operate, the court will refer
to the contract in determining whether an assignment is allowed, but in some the courts will weigh
special considerations favoring consumers in deciding whether to allow an assignment.

**_Consumer credit operations_**

Our consumer credit operations in various jurisdictions are subject to specific licensing or registration
requirements by the respective regulatory bodies and supervision by consumer advocacy agencies. As
a result of these consumer credit licenses, certain rules regarding ownership, ownership management
and management assessment apply to us. These rules involve, among other things, that approval from
the relevant authorities must be obtained prior to a shareholder acquiring shares that would bring the
shareholder’s direct or indirect holding of any of our license-holding entities to, or in excess of, certain
thresholds or the shareholder otherwise obtaining a significant influence over the management of any
of the license-holding entities. The entities subject to consumer license requirements often must comply
with other requirements, such as having dedicated compliance and internal control resources or
meeting capital adequacy requirements that are similar to those applicable to banks.

**_Internal rules framework process and structure_**

Given the level of regulation to which we are subject, we have adopted best practice principles regarding
our internal governance procedures and our regulatory requirements. This internal framework
constitutes a set of minimum requirements to be observed within the Company to ensure we are
operating in accordance with the law and maintaining high ethical standards. By outlining the applicable
requirements and responsibilities, our goal is to remain in compliance with laws and regulations
governing our business activities and, by so doing, reducing the risk of regulatory breach and
subsequent reputational and financial impact on us.

We have enhanced our group-wide internal rules to improve adherence across all of our operations.
These improvements include application of an “end-user perspective,” division of our internal rules
framework into three major blocks—how we run the Company, how we run our business and how we
run our support functions—and instituting a stricter process in general for monitoring our operations and
implementing rules.

**_Dedicated ownership and yearly review_**

We designate so-called Group Owners to be responsible for monitoring and implementing group-wide
rules. The Group Owner ensures that all relevant units and functions within the Company are informed
about our policies. Typically, this is handled in a referral process whereby Group Owners distribute
information on forthcoming, updated or new rules. Local entities use a similar structure and appoint
Local Owners, who ensure that all relevant functions and units on the local level are informed about
new rules and any changes to existing rules.

All group-wide internal rules are subject to annual review. The yearly review process is taking place in
November and December of this year in order to take into account for any changes in the business
plans that might have an impact on the governance structure. The proposed changes are presented to,
and approved by, the CEO and/or the Board.

**_Yearly follow-up on implementation_**

Local compliance officers support the implementation of group-wide internal rules within local entities
and follow up with yearly reports on how thoroughly they have been implemented. A rule-by-rule
assessment is made based on pre-defined criteria and is checked by the local compliance officer. The

139


-----

assessment is signed by the local managing director and is transmitted to our group compliance team
for analysis and reporting on the group level.

**Compliance procedures**

Our policy regarding regulatory compliance defines, among other things, governing principles regarding
identification of governing laws and regulations, delegation of compliance responsibilities, requirements
on education and competence, monitoring, testing and documentation of regulatory compliance control
measures. This instruction applies to all countries and operational units within the Company.

We have established a bank-style governance, applying the three lines of defense model, which
positions us well for regulatory changes. The compliance function, along with the risk function, is part
of the second line of defense and supports the implementation of compliance management procedures
within the business and support functions as well as measures, monitors and reports on compliance
risks.

All of our business entities have an appointed local compliance officer who reports on a regular basis
to the local managing director and, secondarily, to the local board and the group compliance officer.
The group compliance officer reports directly to the group’s chief risk officer, and, secondarily, to the
Board.

**_Risks covered by the compliance procedures_**

The compliance activities are typically performed within the focus areas listed below. The focus areas
for a specific business entity are adapted for the entity in question according to the size and complexity
of its operations, its regulatory requirements and its identified risks.

- _Treating customers fairly: focus on end-customer protection, fair debt collection practices, handling_
of client/customer complaints, safeguarding of customer/client assets, customer/client marketing,
information and documentation;

- _Regulatory licenses: permits, approvals and notifications required by any financial supervisory_
authority, data protection authority, company registrar, national bank or other similar entities;

- _Internal governance: clear and documented organizational structure that specifies reporting lines,_
approval levels/mandates and functions, including the management of outsourced activities;

- _Market conduct: customer/client confidentiality and integrity, disclosure of major shareholdings, gifts_
and entertainments and anti-bribery, market abuse, insider trading, anti-corruption and antitrust
provisions;

- _Conflicts of interest: shall be broadly interpreted to include relations with customers and clients,_
external assignments and board and management decisions;

- _Anti-money laundering and terrorist financing: know your customer procedures, monitoring_
customers and transactions, investigations and reporting requirements;

- _Data protection: compliance with requirements from local data protection authorities and_
implementation of robust internal controls and routines.

**_Regulatory watch_**

Each compliance officer monitors regulatory developments and informs relevant stakeholders,
management and the board about the new regulatory requirements before they are effective and as
soon as practically possible. The regulatory requirements applicable for each entity are documented in
a so-called Regulatory Map.

**_Quarterly reporting_**

Each local compliance officer submits quarterly compliance reports to the group compliance team that
includes information on new rules and regulations, material compliance risks and a recommendation

140


-----

on the actions required for risk mitigation. It also contains any material communication with local
authorities.

**_Risk analysis_**

The compliance risks that are governed by our group compliance policy are assessed and documented
on at least a yearly basis in a so-called Compliance Risk Map, which is maintained for all of our
operational entities. The Compliance Risk Map forms the basis for our yearly compliance program, as
further explained below.

**_Compliance programs_**

All entities shall create their own compliance program and update it on a yearly basis. This program
must contain support activities, such as training, information and compliance related projects, and
monitoring and control activities related to the risk areas covered by our compliance policies. Our group
compliance team also mandates particular support and control activities to be carried out by local
entities.

**_Incident handling and escalation procedures_**

Each compliance officer must report immediately to the local management, the local board and to the
group compliance officer on any new, significant compliance risks, incident, issues or breaches or any
significant regulatory visits, inspections, sanctions or material correspondence with authorities/
regulators.

**_Overview and structure_**

On June 16, 2017, the Issuer (for the purposes of this section ‘‘—Description of Other Indebtedness’’,
the ‘‘Company’’ and, for the purposes of this section ‘‘—Description of Other Indebtedness’’, the
Company and its restricted subsidiaries, the ‘‘Group’’) and certain of its restricted subsidiaries entered
into a multicurrency revolving credit facility agreement (as amended by that certain amendment letter
dated February 28, 2019, the ‘‘Revolving Credit Facility Agreement’’) with, among others, Swedbank
AB (publ), as facility agent and security agent, and Danske Bank A/S, DNB Bank ASA, Nordea Bank
AB (publ), Nykredit Bank A/S and Swedbank AB (publ), as lenders.

The revolving credit facility made available under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (the
‘‘Revolving Credit Facility’’) may be utilized by any current or future borrower under the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement in euro, Swiss francs, sterling, Norwegian krone, Swedish krona, Danish
krone or any other readily available and agreed currency by the drawing of cash advances or the
issuance of letters of credit or ancillary facilities. The Revolving Credit Facility may be used for financing
or refinancing the working capital and general corporate purposes of the Group, including the Merger
and any acquisition permitted or not prohibited by the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (including,
without limitation, any acquisition of debt portfolios to the extent permitted or not prohibited by the

149


-----

Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) but not for the payment of any dividend, redemption, repurchase,
defeasement, retirement, repayment, premium or any other distribution in respect of the share capital
of the Company.

In addition, the Company may elect to request additional facilities as additional tranches or an increase
of existing tranches under the Revolving Credit Facility (the ‘‘Additional Facility Commitments’’). The
Company and the lenders may agree to certain terms in relation to the Additional Facility Commitments,
including the margin and the termination date (each subject to parameters as set out in the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement) and the availability period. Most recently, on May 23, 2019 the Company
entered into Additional Facility Commitments of €275 million with Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB
(publ), which increased the overall commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility to €1,375 million.

The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized from the Closing Date until the date falling 53 months after
the Closing Date. The original borrowers under the Revolving Credit Facility are the Company and Lock
TopCo AS.

**_Interest and fees_**

Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will initially bear interest at rates per annum equal
to, for loans denominated in euro, EURIBOR, for loans denominated in Norwegian krone, NIBOR, for
loans denominated in Swedish krona, STIBOR, for loans denominated in Danish krone, CIBOR, or for
loans denominated in any other currency, LIBOR, plus a margin of 3.00% per annum, subject to a
margin ratchet based on the Net Leverage Ratio. The margin on any loans under an Additional Facility
Commitment will be agreed between the Company and the relevant lenders.

A commitment fee is payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Revolving
Credit Facility from the Closing Date to the end of the availability period for the Revolving Credit Facility
at a rate of 35% of the applicable margin for the Revolving Credit Facility. The commitment fee is
payable quarterly in arrears, on the last date of availability of the Revolving Credit Facility and on the
date the Revolving Credit Facility is cancelled in full or on the date on which a lender cancels its
commitment. Default interest is calculated as an additional 1% on any overdue amount. The Company
is also required to pay customary agency fees to the facility agent and the security agent in connection
with the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Repayments_**

Each advance is required to be repaid on the last day of the interest period relating thereto, subject to
a netting mechanism against amounts to be drawn on such date. All outstanding amounts under the
Revolving Credit Facility are required to be repaid on the termination date, which is the date falling 54
months after the Closing Date. The termination date for a facility under an Additional Facility
Commitment is the date agreed between the Company and the relevant lender(s) providing that
Additional Facility Commitment (subject to certain parameters referred to in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement). Amounts repaid by the borrowers on loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility may
be re-borrowed during the availability period for that facility, subject to certain conditions.

**_Mandatory prepayment_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement allows for voluntary prepayments (subject to minimum
amounts). The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also permits each lender to require the mandatory
prepayment of all amounts due to that lender:

(i) upon the occurrence of a change of control;

(for these purposes, ‘‘change of control’’ means at any time:

(A) any person or group of persons (other than Cidron 1748 S.à r.l or management team or any
person directly or indirectly controlled by any of them) who does not currently control any
member the Group acting in concert gains (directly or indirectly) control of the Company; or

(B) the shares of the Company cease to be listed, traded or publicly quoted on NASDAQ Stockholm
for any reason (excluding, for this purpose, any temporary suspension or limitation imposed on
trading such shares which is remedied within three business days).

150


-----

Where ‘‘control’’ of the Company or a member of the Group means ownership (directly or indirectly)
of the issued shares in the Company or a member of the Group with the right to cast, or control the
casting of, more than 30 per cent. of the maximum number of votes that might be cast at a general
meeting of the Company or such member of the Group.

(ii) upon the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Group (taken as a whole), to a person
who is not a member of the Group.

Following any acquisition which is permitted or not prohibited by the terms of the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement and within 60 days of the closing date of such acquisition, the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement requires that (subject to agreed security principles) each subsidiary of the Company
that is a Material Company (which definition includes, among other things, any member of the Group
that has earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization representing 5% or more of
consolidated EBITDA of the Group or whose gross assets represent 5% or more of the consolidated
gross assets of the Group and calculated by reference to the most recent annual financial statements
of the Group as if such subsidiary had been a member of the Group on the relevant accounting date)
will become a guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement further requires that (subject to agreed security principles) as
soon as practicable after any acquisition permitted thereunder in respect of any company that would
become a Material Company (by reference to the most recent annual financial statements and
calculated as though such company had been a member of the Group on the relevant annual accounting
date) the relevant acquired company will be required to become a guarantor under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement.

Furthermore, if on the last day of a fiscal year, the guarantors represent less than 80% of the
consolidated EBITDA and consolidated gross assets of the Group (subject to certain exceptions), within
90 days of delivery of the annual financial statements for the relevant fiscal year, such other restricted
subsidiaries of the Company (subject to agreed security principles) are required to become additional
guarantors until the requirement is satisfied (to be calculated as if such additional guarantors had been
guarantors on such last day of the relevant fiscal year).

**_Security_**

Any Material Company or other member of the Group which becomes a guarantor of the Revolving
Credit Facility is required (subject to agreed security principles) to grant security over certain of its
assets described therein in favor of the Security Agent.

**_Representations and warranties_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties
(subject to certain exceptions and qualifications and with certain representations and warranties being

151

documents, laws or other obligations, power and authority, authorizations, no default, governing law
and enforcement, insolvency, no misleading information, financial statements, no proceedings pending
or threatened, compliance with environmental and other laws, center of main interests and
establishments, _pari passu_ ranking, acquisition documents, sanctions, money laundering and anticorruption laws.

**_Covenants_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain of the incurrence covenants and related
definitions (with certain adjustments) that are set forth in the Indenture, with additional limitations on
debt incurrence by guarantors and the aggregate amount of any Qualified Receivables Financing. In
addition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains a financial covenant, see ‘‘—Financial
_Covenant.’’_

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also contains a ‘‘notes purchase condition’’ covenant. Subject
to certain exceptions set out in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Company may not, and
shall procure that no other member of the Group will repay, prepay, purchase, defease, redeem or
otherwise acquire or retire the principal amount of the Senior Pari Passu Notes Debt (or any
replacement or refinancing thereof as permitted under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement from
time to time) prior to the termination date in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility in any manner which
involves the payment of cash consideration by any member of the Group to a person which is not a
member of the Group. The exceptions to such covenant include (among other things) payments made
with the proceeds of Available Shareholder Amounts, New Equity or Subordinated Shareholder
Funding, payments following a change of control (provided that the Group is in compliance with its
obligations described in ‘‘—Mandatory prepayment’’) and payments made in circumstances where the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of Senior Pari Passu Notes Debt immediately following the
relevant notes purchase (i) is or would exceed 50% of the aggregate original principal amount of the
Senior Pari Passu Notes Debt which remain outstanding on or are issued by the Company on June 26,
2017 or (ii) is or would be less than 50% of the aggregate original principal amount of all classes of the
Senior Pari Passu Notes Debt in existence on June 26, 2017 and the commitments under the Revolving
Credit Facility are, or will be, at the time the notes purchase completes, cancelled in the same proportion
as (y) the amount by which the aggregate principal amount then outstanding of the Senior Pari Passu
Notes Debt is less than 50% of the aggregate original principal amount of all classes of Senior Pari
Passu Notes Debt on June 26, 2017 of that class bears to (z) 50% of the original aggregate principal
amount of the Senior Pari Passu Notes Debt on June 26, 2017.

152


-----

- maintenance of pari passu ranking of the Revolving Credit Facility; and

- certain pre-closing covenants which apply only until immediately prior to the Closing Date.

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains an information covenant under which, among other
things, the Company is required to deliver to the facility agent annual financial statements, quarterly
financial statements and compliance certificates.

**_Financial covenant_**

Subject to the paragraph below, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires the Company to
comply with a Drawn Super Senior Leverage Ratio (defined as the ratio of the aggregate principal
amount outstanding under each utilization under the Revolving Credit Facility and each additional facility
(including in each case, the amount outstanding under any letter of credit to the extent such letter of
credit is drawn or a claim has been made thereunder by the relevant beneficiary), together with all
ancillary outstandings (but excluding the aggregate amount of all accrued interest, fees and
commissions in respect of such utilizations, additional facilities and ancillary outstandings) (‘‘Drawn
_Super Senior Indebtedness’’) at such date to Consolidated EBITDA for the period of the most recent_
four consecutive financial quarters).

The financial covenant shall only be tested to the extent that a utilization has been requested and, at
any time during the financial quarter ending on the most recent quarter date, the aggregate amount of
all outstanding utilizations and ancillary outstandings under the Revolving Credit Facility was equal to
or greater than 30% of the total commitments on such quarter date. The Drawn Super Senior Leverage
Ratio for any relevant period shall not exceed 2.0:1.0.

The Company is permitted to prevent or cure breaches of the Drawn Super Senior Leverage Ratio by
applying any cure amount (being amounts received by the Company in cash pursuant to any new equity
or permitted subordinated debt) as if Drawn Super Senior Indebtedness had been reduced by such
amount. The portion of such cure amount used to cure a failure to satisfy the Drawn Super Senior
Leverage Ratio is not required to be applied in prepayment of the Revolving Credit Facility and no such
cure amount shall be taken into account for the purposes of the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA.
No more than five cure amounts may be taken into account during the term of the Revolving Credit
Facility and different cure amounts may not be taken into account in successive financial quarters.

**_Events of default_**

The Revolving Credit Facility contains equivalent events of default, with certain adjustments, as those
applicable to the Senior Pari Passu Notes as set forth in the section entitled ‘‘—Description of the
_Notes— Events of Default.’’ In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility contains the following events of_
default:

- failure to satisfy the Drawn Super Senior Leverage Ratio (when tested);

- cross default if a creditor of any member of the Group becomes entitled to declare any indebtedness
in an aggregate amount exceeding €55 million of any obligor due and payable prior to its specified
maturity as a result of an event of default;

- inaccuracy of a representation or statement when made;

- unlawfulness, repudiation, rescission, invalidity or unenforceability of the finance documents
entered into in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility if not remedied within 20 business days;
and

- failure by a party to the Intercreditor Agreement (other than a finance party) to comply with the
provisions of or perform its obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement in any material respect, if

such financing, refinancing or replacement and such sharing in the security to take place in a timely
manner. In particular, each of the secured parties authorizes and directs each of its respective agents
and the Security Agent to execute any amendment to the Intercreditor Agreement and such other debt
documents required by the Company to reflect, enable and/or facilitate any such arrangements.

The Company and the Debtors may make payments of the Senior Liabilities (defined below) and the
Senior Pari Passu Notes Trustee Amounts at any time, provided that following the occurrence of a
Senior Distress Event or a Senior Payment Default (defined below) which is continuing where the
unpaid amount exceeds €15 million (or the equivalent in any optional currency), no Debtor may make

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Senior Secured Creditors (as defined below), the
Company and the Debtors may at any time amend or waive the terms of the finance documents in
relation to the Senior Facility, the Senior Pari Passu Notes and the Permitted Senior Secured Financing
Debt in accordance with their respective terms from time to time (and subject only to any consent
required under them).

**_Security and guarantees: senior secured creditors_**

Any Senior Secured Creditor (and/or any other person acting on behalf of any of them) (in the case of
any Senior Pari Passu Notes Creditor, to the extent the Company has agreed that the relevant Senior
Pari Passu Notes are to benefit from that such Security or guarantee, indemnity or other assurance
against loss) may take, accept or receive the benefit of:

(i) any security from any member of the Group in respect of any of the Senior Lender Liabilities, the
Senior Pari Passu Notes Liabilities or the Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities in addition to the

agreed security principles:

(A) the security provider becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor (if not already
a party in that capacity);

(B) all amounts actually received or recovered by any Senior Secured Creditor with respect to any
such security shall immediately be paid to the Security Agent and applied in accordance with

than from the Senior Subordinated Debt Issuer) regarding any of the Senior Lender Liabilities, the
Senior Pari Passu Notes Liabilities or the Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities in addition to those
in:

(A) the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Pari Passu Notes Indenture or any Permitted Senior
Secured Financing Document;

(B) the Intercreditor Agreement; or

benefit of which (however conferred) is, to the extent legally possible and subject to certain
agreed security principles, given to all the senior secured parties in respect of their secured
obligations;

provided that, to the extent legally possible, and subject to certain agreed security principles,

(1) the guarantee provider becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor (if not
already a party in that capacity);

(2) such guarantee, indemnity or assurance against loss is expressed to be subject to the

Passu Notes or the Senior Subordinated Notes, unless required pursuant to the terms of the Senior
Pari Passu Notes Indenture or the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture (as the case may be).

**_Restriction on enforcement: senior lenders and senior pari passu notes creditors_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that none of the Senior Lenders, the Senior Pari Passu Note

Permitted Senior Secured Financing Creditors may take certain Enforcement Action (as defined below)
without the prior written consent of an Instructing Group.

Notwithstanding the above restriction or anything to the contrary in the Intercreditor Agreement, after
the occurrence of certain specified insolvency events (an ‘‘Insolvency Event’’) in relation to a Debtor,
each Senior Lender, Senior Pari Passu Note holder (only to the extent the Company has agreed that
the relevant Senior Pari Passu Notes are to benefit from that such Security or guarantee, indemnity or
other assurance against loss) and/or Permitted Senior Secured Financing Creditor may, to the extent it
is able to do so under the relevant debt documents, take certain Enforcement Action and/or claim in the
winding up, dissolution, administration, reorganization or similar insolvency event of that Debtor for
liabilities owing to it (but a Senior Secured Creditor may not direct the Security Agent to enforce the
security in any manner).

**_Option to purchase: senior secured creditors_**

Senior Pari Passu Note holders holding at least a simple majority of the Senior Pari Passu Notes
liabilities or Permitted Senior Secured Financing Creditors holding at least a simple majority of the
Permitted Senior Secured Financing Liabilities (the ‘‘Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors’’) may, after
the occurrence of an acceleration event which is continuing, by giving not less than ten (10) days’ notice
to the Security Agent, require the transfer to them (or to a nominee or nominees), in accordance with
the applicable transfer provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, of all, but not part, of the rights,
benefits and obligations in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities (a ‘‘Senior Liabilities Transfer’’) if:

(i) (that transfer is lawful and, subject to paragraph (ii) below, otherwise permitted by the terms of the
Senior Facilities Agreement;

(ii) any conditions relating to such a transfer contained in the Senior Facilities Agreement are complied
with, other than:

(A) any requirement to obtain the consent of, or consult with, a member of the Group in relation to
such transfer, which consent or consultation shall not be required; and

(B) to the extent to which all the Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors provide cash cover for any
letter of credit, the consent of the relevant letter of credit issuing bank relating to such transfer;

of:

(A) any amounts provided as cash cover by the Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors for any letter
of credit (as envisaged in paragraph (ii)(B) above);

(B) all of the Senior Lender Liabilities at that time (whether or not due), including all amounts that
would have been payable under the Senior Facilities Agreement if the Senior Facility were
being prepaid by the relevant Debtors on the date of that payment; and

(C) all costs and expenses (including legal fees) incurred by the Senior Facility Agent and/or the
Senior Lenders and/or the Security Agent as a consequence of giving effect to that transfer;

as a result of that transfer the Senior Lenders have no further actual or contingent liability to a
Debtor under the Senior Facilities finance documents.

(iv) an indemnity is provided from each of the Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors (other than any
Senior Agent) or from another third-party acceptable to all the Senior Lenders in a form reasonably

164


-----

satisfactory to each Senior Lender in respect of all costs, expenses, losses and liabilities which may
be sustained or incurred by any Senior Lender in consequence of any sum received or recovered
by any Senior Lender from any person being required (or it being alleged that it is required) to be
paid back by or clawed back from any Senior Lender for any reason;

(v) the transfer is made without recourse to, or representation or warranty from, the Senior Lenders,
except that each Senior Lender shall be deemed to have represented and warranted on the date
of that transfer that it has the corporate power to effect that transfer and it has taken all necessary
action to authorize the making by it of that transfer; and

(vi) the Senior Subordinated Creditors have not exercised their rights to purchase as described under
the provisions set out in the paragraph captioned ‘‘—Option to Purchase: Senior Subordinated
_Creditors’’ or, having exercised such rights, have not failed to complete the acquisition of the_
relevant Senior Secured Liabilities in accordance with such provisions.

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors may only require a
Senior Liabilities Transfer if, at the same time, they require a transfer of the Hedging Liabilities in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement and if, for any reason, such transfer cannot be made in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, no Senior Liabilities Transfer may be required to be made.

At the request of a Senior Agent (on behalf of the Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors), the Senior
Facility Agent shall notify that Senior Agent of the foregoing payable sums in connection with such
transfer.

Agreement; or

(iii) create or permit to subsist any security over any assets of any member of the Group or give any
guarantee (and the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee or Senior Subordinated Creditor
Representative, as the case may be, may not, and no Senior Subordinated Creditor may, accept
the benefit of any such security or guarantee from any member of the Group) for, or in respect of,
any Senior Subordinated Notes liabilities or any Permitted Subordinated Financing Liabilities other

(a) a Senior Payment Default is continuing; or

(b) an event of default under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Pari Passu Notes Indenture
and/or any Permitted Senior Secured Financing Agreement (a ‘‘Senior Event of Default’’) (other
than a Senior Payment Default) is continuing, from the date which is one business day after the
date on which any of the Senior Facility Agent, the Senior Pari Passu Notes Trustee and any Senior
Secured Creditor Representative (together, the ‘‘Senior Agents’’) delivers a payment stop notice (a
‘‘Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice’’) specifying the event or circumstance in relation to

(v) the Senior Discharge Date; and

(vi) the date on which the Security Agent, the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee or any Senior
Subordinated Creditor Representative takes Enforcement Action permitted under the

payments:

(a) capitalization of accrued interest under the Senior Subordinated Notes finance documents on its

any other event or set of circumstances. No Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice may be served
in respect of a Senior Event of Default which had been notified to the Senior Agents (as defined below)
at the time at which an earlier Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice was issued.

Any failure to make a payment due under the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture and any Permitted
Subordinated Financing Documents as a result of the issue of a Senior Subordinated Payment Stop
Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an Event
of Default (as defined in the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture or any Permitted Subordinated
Financing Documents, as applicable) as a consequence of that failure to make a payment in relation to
the relevant Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture and any Permitted Subordinated Financing
Documents; or (ii) the issue of a Senior Subordinated Enforcement Notice (as defined below) on behalf
of the Senior Subordinated Creditors.

operation of the provisions set out under each section above under the caption ‘‘—Restrictions Relating
_to Senior Subordinated Creditors and Senior Subordinated Liabilities’’ even if its obligation to make_
such payment is restricted at any time by the terms of any of those provisions.

The accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with the Senior Subordinated Notes
Indenture and any Permitted Subordinated Financing Document shall continue notwithstanding the
issue of a Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice.

**_Cure of payment stop_**

If:

(a) at any time following the issue of a Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of
a Senior Payment Default, that Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding
and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and

(b) the relevant Senior Subordinated Guarantor or the relevant Debtor then promptly pays to the Senior
Subordinated Creditors an amount equal to any payments which had accrued under the Senior
Subordinated Notes Indenture and any Permitted Subordinated Financing Document and which
would have been Permitted Senior Subordinated Payments but for that Senior Subordinated
Payment Stop Notice or Senior Payment Default,

then any Event of Default (including any cross default or similar provision under any other debt
document) which may have occurred as a result of that suspension of payments shall be waived, and
any Senior Subordinated Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that Event of
Default shall be waived, in each case without any further action being required on the part of the Senior
Subordinated Creditors or any other Creditor.

(iv) the Relevant Senior Subordinated Default is continuing at the end of the relevant Senior
Subordinated Standstill Period.

Promptly upon becoming aware of a Senior Subordinated Event of Default, the Senior Subordinated
Notes Trustee or the Senior Subordinated Creditor Representative, as the case may be, may by notice
(a ‘‘Senior Subordinated Enforcement Notice’’) in writing notify the Senior Agents of the existence of
such Senior Subordinated Event of Default.

**_Senior subordinated standstill period_**

In relation to a Relevant Senior Subordinated Default, a Senior Subordinated Standstill Period shall
mean the period beginning on the date (the ‘‘Senior Subordinated Standstill Start Date’’) the relevant
Senior Agent serves a Senior Subordinated Enforcement Notice on each of the Senior Agents in respect
of such Senior Subordinated Event of Default and ending on the earlier to occur of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after the Senior Subordinated Standstill Start Date;

(ii) the date the Senior Secured Parties take any Enforcement Action in relation to a particular
guarantor of the Senior Subordinated Notes and any Permitted Subordinated Financing Debt (a
‘‘Senior Subordinated Guarantor’’), provided, however, that if a Senior Subordinated Standstill
Period ends pursuant to this paragraph, the Senior Subordinated Creditors may only take the same
Enforcement Action in relation to the Senior Subordinated Guarantor as the Enforcement Action
taken by the Senior Secured Parties against such Senior Subordinated Guarantor and not against
any other member of the Group;

(iii) the date of an Insolvency Event in relation to the relevant Senior Subordinated Debt Issuer or a
particular Senior Subordinated Guarantor against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken;

(iv) the expiry of any other Senior Subordinated Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first
mentioned Senior Subordinated Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a result
of a cure, waiver or other permitted remedy);

(v) the date on which the consent of each of the Senior Facility Agent (acting on the instructions of the
Majority Senior Lenders), any Senior Pari Passu Notes Trustee (acting on behalf of the Senior Pari
Passu Note holders) and any Senior Secured Creditor Representative (acting on the instructions
the Majority Permitted Senior Secured Financing Creditors) has been obtained; and

(vi) a failure to pay the principal amount outstanding under the Senior Subordinated Notes or on any
Permitted Subordinated Financing Debt, as the case may be, at the final stated maturity of the
amounts outstanding under the Senior Subordinated Notes or on the Permitted Subordinated
Financing Debt, as the case may be (provided that, unless the Senior Lender Discharge Date has
occurred or as otherwise agreed by the Majority Senior Lenders and the Company, such final stated
maturity has not been amended to fall on a date prior to the date falling 96 months after the date of
the Intercreditor Agreement),

172


-----

(the ‘‘Senior Subordinated Standstill Period’’).

**_Subsequent senior subordinated event of default_**

The Senior Subordinated Finance Parties may take Enforcement Action under the provisions set out
under the caption ‘‘—Permitted Senior Subordinated Enforcement’’ above in relation to a Senior
Subordinated Event of Default even if, at the end of any relevant Senior Subordinated Standstill Period
or at any later time, a further Senior Subordinated Standstill Period has begun as a result of any other
Senior Subordinated Event of Default.

**_Enforcement on behalf of senior subordinated creditors_**

If the Security Agent has notified each of the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee and any Senior
Subordinated Creditor Representative (the ‘‘Senior Subordinated Agents’’) that it is enforcing security
created pursuant to any security document over shares or assets of a Senior Subordinated Guarantor,
no Senior Subordinated Creditor may take any action referred to under the provisions set out under the
caption ‘‘—Permitted Senior Subordinated Enforcement’’ above against that Senior Subordinated
Guarantor (or any subsidiary of that Senior Subordinated Guarantor) while the Security Agent is taking
steps to enforce that security in accordance with the instructions of an Instructing Group where such
action might be reasonably likely to adversely affect such enforcement or the amount of proceeds to be
derived therefrom.

**_Option to purchase: senior subordinated creditors_**

Subject to the following paragraphs, any of the Senior Subordinated Agents (on behalf of the Senior
Subordinated Creditors) may, after an acceleration event under any of the Senior Facilities Agreement,
the Senior Pari Passu Notes or in relation to any Permitted Senior Secured Financing Debt which is
continuing, by giving not less than 10 days’ notice to the Security Agent, require the transfer to the
Senior Subordinated Creditors of all, but not part, of the rights, benefits and obligations in respect of the
Senior Lender Liabilities, the Senior Pari Passu Notes Liabilities and the Permitted Senior Secured
Financing Liabilities (the ‘‘Senior Secured Liabilities’’) if:

(i) that transfer is lawful and, subject to paragraph (ii) below, otherwise permitted by the terms of the
Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Pari Passu Notes Indenture and any Permitted Senior
Secured Financing Agreement (as applicable);

(ii) any conditions relating to such a transfer contained in the Senior Facilities Agreement (in the case
of the Senior Lender Liabilities), the Senior Pari Passu Notes Indenture (in the case of the Senior
Pari Passu Notes Liabilities) and any Permitted Senior Secured Financing Agreement (in the case
of the Permitted Senior Secured Financing Liabilities) are complied with, in each case, other than
as specified in the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) each of the Senior Facility Agent, on behalf of the Senior Lenders, the Senior Pari Passu Notes
Trustee, on behalf of the relevant Senior Pari Passu Note holders and the applicable Senior
Secured Creditor Representative, on behalf of the relevant Permitted Senior Secured Financing
Creditors, is paid the amounts required under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iv) as a result of that transfer the Senior Lenders, the Senior Pari Passu Note holders and the Permitted
Senior Secured Financing Creditors have no further actual or contingent liability to the Company or
any other Debtor under the relevant Secured Debt Documents;

(v) an indemnity is provided from each Senior Subordinated Creditor (other than any Senior
Subordinated Notes Trustee) (or another acceptable third party) in respect of all costs, expenses,
losses and liabilities which may be sustained or incurred by any Senior Lender, Senior Pari Passu
Note holder or Permitted Senior Secured Financing Creditor in consequence of any sum received
or recovered by any such party from any person being required (or it being alleged that it is required)
to be paid back by or clawed back from any Senior Lender or Senior Pari Passu Note holder,
Permitted Senior Secured Financing Creditor for any reason; and

(vi) the transfer is made without recourse to, or representation or warranty from, the Senior Lenders,
the Senior Pari Passu Note holders or the Permitted Senior Secured Financing, except that each
of them shall be deemed to have represented and warranted on the date of that transfer that it has

173


-----

the corporate power to effect that transfer and it has taken all necessary action to authorize the
making by it of that transfer.

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, a Senior Subordinated Agent (on behalf of all the Senior
Subordinated Creditors) may only require a transfer of Senior Secured Liabilities if, at the same time,
they require a transfer of Hedging Liabilities regulated by the Intercreditor Agreement and if, for any
reason, such transfer cannot be made in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, no transfer of
Senior Secured Liabilities may be required to be made.

At the request of a Senior Subordinated Agent (on behalf of all the Senior Subordinated Creditors), the
Senior Facility Agent, the Senior Pari Passu Notes Trustee and any relevant Senior Secured Creditor
Representative shall notify the Senior Subordinated Agents of the foregoing payable sums in connection
with such transfer.

**_Effect of insolvency event; filing of claims_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, among other things, after the occurrence of an Insolvency
Event in relation to any Debtor, or, following an acceleration event which is continuing, any member of
the Group, any party entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of that member of the Group in
respect of liabilities owed to that party shall (if prior to a Distress Event, only if required by the Security
Agent arising on the instructions of an Instructing Group), subject to receiving payment instructions and
any other relevant information from the Security Agent and to the extent it is able to do so, including
pursuant to applicable law and regulation, direct the person responsible for the distribution of the assets
of that member of the Group to pay that distribution to the Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the
secured parties have been paid in full. In this respect, the Security Agent shall apply distributions paid
to it in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption ‘‘—Application of proceeds’’ below.

Subject to certain exceptions, to the extent that any member of the Group’s liabilities are discharged by
way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to that
member of the Group and any creditor which benefited from that set-off shall (if prior to a Distress Event,
only if required by the Security Agent arising on the instructions of an Instructing Group), subject to
receiving payment instructions and any other relevant information from the Security Agent, pay an
amount equal to the amount of the liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the
Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out in the caption ‘‘—Application of
_proceeds’’ below and subject to certain exceptions._

Subject to the provisions set out in the caption ‘‘—Application of proceeds’’ below, if the Security Agent
or any other secured party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in respect of any of the
liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent that the
realization proceeds are actually applied towards the liabilities.

After the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to any Debtor or, following an acceleration event
which is continuing, any member of the Group and each creditor irrevocably authorizes the Security
Agent, on its behalf, to:

(i) take any Enforcement Action (in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) against
that member of the Group;

(ii) demand, sue, prove and give receipt for any or all of that member of Group’s liabilities;

(iii) collect and receive all distributions on, or on account of, any or all of that member of Group’s
liabilities; and

(iv) file claims, take proceedings and do all other things the Security Agent considers reasonably
necessary to recover in respect of that member of Group’s liabilities.

Each creditor will (i) do all things that the Security Agent reasonably requests in order to give effect to
the matters referred to in this ‘‘—Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims’’ section and (ii) if the
Security Agent is not entitled to take any of the actions contemplated by this ‘‘—Effect of Insolvency
_Event; Filing of Claims’’ section or if the Security Agent requests that a creditor take that action,_
undertake that action itself in accordance with the instructions of the Security Agent or grant a power of
attorney to the Security Agent (on such terms as the Security Agent may reasonably require, although

174


-----

the Senior Pari Passu Notes Trustee and the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee shall be under no
obligation to grant such powers of attorney) to enable the Security Agent to take such action.

**_Turnover_**

_Turnover by primary creditors_

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that prior to the Senior Discharge
Date if any Primary Creditor receives or recovers from any member of the Group the proceeds of any
enforcement of any security or, following the occurrence of a Distress Event, proceeds which should
have otherwise been received, recovered or realized by the Security Agent pursuant to the debt
documents, that Primary Creditor will: (i) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered
by way of set-off (x) hold an amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less,
the amount received or recovered) on trust for the Security Agent and subject to receiving payment
instructions and any other relevant information from the Security Agent, promptly pay that amount to
the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and (y)
subject to receiving payment instructions and any other relevant information the Security Agent,
promptly pay an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the
relevant liabilities to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement; and (ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, subject
to receiving payment instructions and any other relevant information from the Security Agent, promptly
pay an amount equal to that receipt or recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Turnover by senior subordinated creditors and subordinated creditors_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that prior to the Senior Discharge
Date if any Senior Subordinated Creditor or prior to the Final Discharge Date, Subordinated Creditor
receives or recovers from any member of the Group (other than the Senior Subordinated Debt Issuer):

(a) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities which is
prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement or is not in accordance with the provisions set out
below the caption ‘‘—Application of proceeds’’;

(b) other than as referred to in the second paragraph of the caption ‘‘—Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing
_of Claims’’ any amount by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it which does not_
give effect to a payment permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(c) other than by way of set-off, any amount:

(i) on account of, or in relation to, any of the Senior Subordinated Notes Liabilities, Permitted
Subordinated Financing Liabilities, Investor Liabilities or Intra-Group Liabilities (x) after the
occurrence of a Distress Event or (y) as a result of any other litigation or proceedings against
a Debtor or a member of the Group (other than after the occurrence of an insolvency event in
respect of that Debtor or that member of the Group) other than, in each case, any amount
received or recovered in accordance with the provisions set out below the caption ‘‘—
_Application of proceeds’’; or_

(ii) by way of set-off in respect of any of the Senior Subordinated Notes Liabilities, Permitted
Subordinated Financing Liabilities, Investor Liabilities or Intra-Group Liabilities owed to it after
the occurrence of a Distress Event; or

(d) the proceeds of the enforcement of any transaction security except in accordance with the
provisions set out in the caption ‘‘—Application of proceeds’’; or

(e) subject to certain exceptions, any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or
in relation to, any of the liabilities owed by any member of Group which is not in accordance with
the provisions set out in the caption ‘‘—Application of proceeds’’ and which is made as a result of,
or after, the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that member of Group,

that Senior Subordinated Creditor or Subordinated Creditor (as applicable) will, subject to certain
exceptions: (i) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold

175


-----

an amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received or
recovered) on trust for the Security Agent and subject to receiving payment instructions and any other
relevant information from the Security Agent, promptly pay that amount to the Security Agent for
application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and (y) subject to receiving
payment instructions and any other relevant information from the Security Agent, promptly pay an
amount equal to the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities to
the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (ii)
in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, subject to receiving
payment instructions and any other relevant information from the Security Agent, promptly pay an
amount equal to that receipt or recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Enforcement of security_**

_Enforcement instructions_

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing: (a) the security unless instructed otherwise by (i) an
Instructing Group; or (ii) if required as set out under the fourth paragraph of this section, the Majority
Senior Subordinated Creditors; and (b) the Senior Subordinated Notes Only Security unless instructed
otherwise by the Majority Senior Subordinated Creditors.

Subject to the security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms (i) an Instructing Group
may give or refrain from giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from enforcing the
relevant transaction security as they see fit provided that the instructions as to Enforcement given by
the Instructing Group are consistent with the security enforcement principles set out therein (the
‘‘Security Enforcement Principles’’); or (ii) to the extent permitted to enforce or to require the
enforcement of the Shared Security prior to the Senior Discharge Date under the provisions under the
caption ‘‘—Restrictions Relating to Senior Subordinated Creditors and Senior Subordinated Liabilities’’
above, the Majority Senior Subordinated Creditors may give or refrain from giving instructions to the
Security Agent to enforce, or refrain from enforcing, the security as they see fit.

Subject to the Senior Subordinated Notes Only Security having become enforceable in accordance with
its terms the Majority Senior Subordinated Creditors may give or refrain from giving instructions to the
Security Agent to enforce or refrain from enforcing the Senior Subordinated Notes Only Security as they
see fit.

Prior to the Senior Discharge Date, (i) if an Instructing Group has instructed the Security Agent not to
enforce or to cease enforcing the security or (ii) in the absence of instructions from an Instructing Group,
and, in each case, an Instructing Group has not required any Debtor to make a distressed disposal, the
Security Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the Shared Security which the Majority
Senior Subordinated Creditors are then entitled to give to the Security Agent under the provisions under
the caption ‘‘—Restrictions Relating to Senior Subordinated Creditors and Senior Subordinated
_Liabilities’’ above._

Subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, no secured party shall have any
independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to, any security or to exercise any rights or powers
arising under the security documents except through the Security Agent.

_Manner of enforcement_

If the security is being enforced as set forth above under the caption ‘‘—Enforcement Instructions,’’ the
Security Agent shall enforce the security in such manner (including, without limitation, the selection of
any administrator or equivalent officer of any Debtor to be appointed by the Security Agent) as:

(i) an Instructing Group shall instruct, provided that such instructions are consistent with the Security
Enforcement Principles or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent considers
in its discretion to be appropriate and consistent with the Security Enforcement Principles; or

(ii) prior to the Senior Discharge Date and only insofar as the security concerned is Shared Security, if
(i) (i) the Security Agent has, pursuant to the fourth paragraph of this ‘‘—Enforcement of
_Security’’ section, given effect to instructions given by the Majority Senior Subordinated Creditors_
to enforce the Shared Security and (ii) an Instructing Group has not given instructions as to the

176


-----

manner of enforcement of the security, the Majority Senior Subordinated Creditors shall instruct or,
in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit provided that, the consent of
the Senior Creditor Representative representing an Instructing Group is required if any such
instructions are given by the Majority Senior Subordinated Creditors and are not in accordance with
the Security Enforcement Principles.

In the event that following receipt of instructions from an Instructing Group (an ‘‘Initial Enforcement
**Notice’’) conflicting enforcement instructions are received by the Security Agent or no instructions are**
received from Senior Secured Creditors entitled to give such instructions as an Instructing Group, the
Security Agent shall enforce the security, refrain or cease from enforcing the security or, as the case
may be, take the relevant other Enforcement Action in accordance with the instructions given the
holders of more than 50% of the total ‘‘Senior Secured Credit Participations,’’ being the aggregate of all
outstanding liabilities under certain hedging liabilities, the Senior Pari Passu Notes (to the extent the
Company has agreed that the relevant Senior Pari Passu Notes are to benefit from any transaction
security, the principal amount of outstanding Senior Pari Passu Notes Liabilities held by that Senior Pari
Passu Noteholder) and any other indebtedness sharing the transaction security on a first-ranking basis
other than the Super Priority Creditors (in each case provided that such instructions are consistent with
any applicable requirements of the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents) and the terms
of all instructions given by any other Instructing Group shall be deemed revoked.

If, prior to the Senior Lender Discharge Date:

(i) the Super Priority Creditors have not been fully repaid within six months of the date on which the
Initial Enforcement Notice was received;

(ii) the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement of the transaction security (or a
transaction in lieu thereof) or other Enforcement Action within three months of the date on which
the Initial Enforcement Notice was received; or

(iii) an Insolvency Event has occurred and the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement of
the transaction security (or a transaction in lieu thereof) or other Enforcement Action at that time,

then the Security Agent shall follow the instructions given by the Majority Super Priority Creditors (in
each case provided that such instructions are consistent with any applicable requirements of the
Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents).

_Exercise of voting rights_

To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, each Subordinated Creditor shall agree with the
Security Agent that it will cast its vote in any proposal put to the vote by, or under the supervision of,
any judicial or supervisory authority in respect of any insolvency, pre-insolvency or rehabilitation or
similar proceedings relating to any member of the Group as instructed by the Security Agent. The
Security Agent

shall give instructions for the purposes of this paragraph as directed by an Instructing Group or, in the
case of the Senior Subordinated Debt Issuer, the Majority Senior Subordinated Creditors.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party can exercise or require any other creditor under the Intercreditor
Agreement to exercise its power of voting or representation to waive, reduce, discharge, extend the due
date for payment or otherwise reschedule any of the liabilities owed to that creditor.

_Waiver of rights_

To the extent permitted under applicable law and subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement, each of the secured parties and the Debtors waives all rights it may otherwise have to
require that the security or the Senior Subordinated Notes Only Security be enforced in any particular
order or manner or at any particular time, or that any sum received or recovered from any person, or by
virtue of the enforcement of any of the security or the Senior Subordinated Notes Only Security or of
any other security interest, which is capable of being applied in or towards discharge of any of the
secured obligations, is so applied.

177


-----

_Security held by other creditors_

If any security is held by a creditor other than the Security Agent, then that creditor may only enforce
that security in accordance with instructions given by an Instructing Group pursuant to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement (and for this purpose references to the Security Agent shall be construed as
references to that creditor).

_Senior subordinated notes only security_

The Senior Subordinated Notes Creditors or an agent acting on their behalf may enforce the Senior
Subordinated Notes Only Security as provided for under the relevant Senior Subordinated Notes
Finance Documents.

_Duties owed_

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, each of the secured parties and the Debtors acknowledges
that, in the event that the Security Agent enforces, or is instructed to enforce, the security prior to the
Senior Discharge Date, the duties of the Security Agent and of any receiver or delegate owed to any
Secured Parties in respect of the method, type and timing of that enforcement or of the exploitation,
management or realization of any of that security shall (subject to certain exceptions) be no different to
or greater than the duty that is owed by the Security Agent, receiver or delegate to the Debtors under
general law.

**_Proceeds of disposals_**

_Non-distressed disposals_

The Security Agent is irrevocably authorized and instructed (at the request and cost of the relevant
Debtor or the Company) to promptly release (or procure that any other relevant person releases):

(a) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any asset which is the subject
of:

(i) a disposal not prohibited by the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Pari Passu
Notes Indenture, any Permitted Senior Secured Financing Agreement, the Senior Subordinated
Notes Indenture and any Permitted Subordinated Financing Agreement (each a ‘‘Debt
**Financing Agreement’’) (including a disposal to a member of the Group, but without prejudice**
to any obligation of any member of the Group in a Debt Financing Agreement to provide
replacement security); or

(ii) any other transaction not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement pursuant to
which that asset will cease to be held or owned by a member of the Group;

(b) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any document or agreement
in order for any member of the Group to effect any amendment or waiver in respect of that document
or agreement or otherwise exercise any rights, comply with any obligations or take any action in
relation to that document or agreement (in each case to the extent not prohibited by the terms of
any Debt Financing Agreement);

(c) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any asset of any member of
the Group which has ceased to be a Debtor; and

(d) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any other asset to the extent
that such release is in accordance with the terms of the Debt Financing Agreements.

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor (or any holding company of
any Debtor), or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor (or any holding company of any
Debtor) will cease to be a member of the Group or a Debtor, the Security Agent (on behalf of itself and
the Secured Parties (as defined below)) shall (at the request and cost of the relevant Debtor or the
Company) promptly release (or procure the release of) that Debtor and its subsidiaries from all present
and future liabilities under the Secured Debt Documents.

178


-----

When making any request for a release pursuant to this ‘‘—Non-Distressed Disposals’’ section, the
Company shall confirm in writing to the Security Agent that:

(i) in the case of any release requested pursuant to paragraph (i) or (ii) above, the relevant disposal
or other action is not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement; or

(ii) in the case of any release requested pursuant to paragraph (iv) above, the relevant release is in
accordance with terms of the Debt Financing Agreements,

and the Security Agent shall be entitled to rely on that confirmation for all purposes under the Secured
Debt Documents.

In the case of any release of security requested by the Company pursuant to the applicable provisions
of the Senior Facilities Agreement as part of a permitted transaction under the Senior Facilities
Agreement, when making that request the Company shall confirm to the Security Agent that:

(i) such request is a permitted transaction request (and absent any such statement in a request for a
release the Security Agent shall be entitled to assume for all purposes that such request is not a
permitted transaction request); and

(ii) it has determined in good faith (taking into account any applicable legal limitations and other
relevant considerations in relation to that permitted transaction) that it is either not possible or not
desirable to implement that permitted transaction on terms satisfactory to the Company by instead
granting additional security and/or amending the terms of the existing security,

and the Security Agent shall be entitled to rely on that confirmation for all purposes under the Secured
Debt Documents.

The Security Agent shall (at the cost and expense of the relevant Debtor or the Company but without
the need for any further consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Creditor or Debtor)
promptly enter into and deliver such documentation and/or take such other action as the Company
(acting reasonably) shall require to give effect to any release or other matter described above.

If any member of the Group is required or not prohibited under the senior debt documents to apply the
proceeds of any disposal or other transaction in prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or
reduction of the Senior Lender Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities, the Senior Pari Passu Notes Liabilities
or the Permitted Senior Secured Financing Liabilities (as applicable) (together, the ‘‘Senior Liabilities’’)
then no such application of those proceeds shall require the consent of any other party or result in any
breach of any Senior Subordinated Finance Documents and such application shall discharge in full any
obligation to apply those proceeds in prepayment, redemption or other discharge or reduction of any
Senior Subordinated Liabilities.

_Distressed disposals_

A ‘‘Distressed Disposal’’ is a disposal of an asset which is (a) being effected at the request of an
Instructing Group in circumstances where the security has become enforceable in accordance with the
terms of the relevant security documents, (b) being effected by enforcement of security in accordance
with the terms of the relevant security documents or (c) being disposed of to a third party subsequent
to a Distress Event.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at
the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Company and without any consent, sanction, authority or further
confirmation from any creditor or Debtor):

(a) to release the security or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver or enter into any
release of that security or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any floating charge or
any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be considered necessary
or desirable;

(b) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release:

179


-----

(i) that Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing liabilities, its
guarantee liabilities and its other liabilities;

(ii) any security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over any of its assets; and

(iii) any other claim of an investor, an intra-group lender, or another Debtor over that Debtor’s
assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor,

on behalf of the relevant creditors, Debtors and agents;

(c) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a
Debtor, to release:

(i) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of its
borrowing liabilities, its guarantees liabilities and its other liabilities;

(ii) any security granted by that holding company or any subsidiary of that holding company over
any of its assets; and

(iii) any other claim of any investor, any intra-group lender or another Debtor over that holding
company’s assets or the assets of any subsidiary of that holding company,

on behalf of the relevant creditors, Debtors and agents;

(d) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company
of a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides
to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities or the Debtor liabilities owed by that Debtor or holding
company or any subsidiary of that Debtor or holding company:

(i) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not intend
that any transferee of those liabilities or Debtor liabilities (the ‘‘Transferee’’) will be treated as a
Primary Creditor or the Security Agent, any receiver or delegate and each of the agents, the
arrangers, the Senior Secured Creditors and the Senior Subordinated Creditors (each a
‘‘Secured Party’’) for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement), to execute and deliver or
enter into any agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities or Debtor liabilities, provided
that, notwithstanding any other provision of any debt document, the Transferee shall not be
treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor
Agreement; and

(ii) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend that
any Transferee will be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement), to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of: all
(and not part only) of the liabilities owed to the Primary Creditors and all or part of any other
liabilities and the Debtor liabilities,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors and Debtors;

(e) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company
of a Debtor (the ‘‘Disposed Entity’’) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the ‘‘Receiving Entity’’) all or any
part of the Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of any subsidiary of that Disposed Entity
in respect of the intra-group liabilities or the Debtor liabilities, to execute and deliver or enter into
any agreement to:

(i) agree to the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or
Debtor liabilities on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to which those
obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and

(ii) (if the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also a guarantor
of Senior Liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those
intra-group liabilities or Debtor liabilities on behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities

180


-----

to which the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or Debtor liabilities are to be
transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities or
Debtor liabilities) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions
set out under the caption ‘‘—Application of proceeds’’ as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an
enforcement of the security and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities or Debtor liabilities has
occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities or Debtor liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities) effected by, or at the request of, the
Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), the Security Agent shall take
reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions (though the Security
Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities
in order to achieve a higher price).

Where borrowing liabilities in respect of any Senior Liabilities would otherwise be released pursuant to
the Intercreditor Agreement, the creditor concerned may elect to have those borrowing liabilities
transferred to the Company in which case the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (to the extent
legally possible and at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Company and without any consent,
sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor) to execute such documents as
are required to so transfer those borrowing liabilities.

Subject to the immediately following paragraph, in the case of a Distressed Disposal effected by or at
the request of the Security Agent, unless the consent of each Senior Agent is otherwise obtained, it is
a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal that the proceeds of such disposal are in cash
(or substantially all in cash) except to the extent contemplated by the Security Enforcement Principles
and such sale or disposal is made pursuant to a Public Auction in respect of which the Primary Creditors
are entitled to participate or where a Financial Adviser has delivered an opinion in respect of such sale
or disposal that the amount received in connection therewith is fair from a financial point of view. The
Primary Creditors shall be entitled to receive access to any valuation report commissioned by a member
of the Group in connection with any Public Auction (provided access is given to the other Primary
Creditors at the same time).

If prior to the discharge date for the Senior Subordinated Notes or any Permitted Subordinated
Financing Debt, a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that the Senior Subordinated Notes
Guarantees and the guarantees of any Permitted Subordinated Financing Debt or any security over the
assets of a Senior Subordinated Debt Issuer or any Senior Subordinated Guarantor will be released
and/or the Senior Subordinated Notes liabilities and any Permitted Subordinated Financing Liabilities
will be released or disposed of, it is a further condition to the release that either:

(a) the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee and any Senior Subordinated Creditor Representative has
approved the release; or

(b) where shares or assets of a Senior Subordinated Guarantor or assets of the Senior Subordinated
Debt Issuer are sold:

(i) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash);

(ii) all claims of the Senior Secured Creditors against a member of the Group (if any), all of whose
shares (other than any minority interest not owned by members of the Group) are sold or
disposed of pursuant to such Distressed Disposal, are unconditionally released and discharged
or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and are not assumed by the purchaser or
one of its affiliates), and all security under the security documents in respect of the assets that
are sold or disposed of is simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged
concurrently with such sale, provided that, if each Senior Agent (acting reasonably and in good
faith):

(A) determines that the Senior Secured Creditors will recover a greater amount if such claim is
sold or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or one of its affiliates and not released or
discharged; and

(B) serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming the same,

181


-----

the Security Agent shall be entitled to sell or otherwise transfer such claim to the purchaser or one
of its affiliates; and

(iii) such sale or disposal is made:

(A) pursuant to a Public Auction in respect of which the Primary Creditors are entitled to
participate; or

(B) where a Financial Adviser has delivered an opinion in respect of such sale or disposal that
the amount received in connection therewith is fair from a financial point of view.

**_Senior subordinated distressed disposals_**

If a Senior Subordinated Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is
irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the Investors and without any consent, sanction, authority or
further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor):

(a) to release the Senior Subordinated Notes Only Security or any other claim over that asset and
execute and deliver or enter into any release of that security or claim and issue any letters of noncrystallization of any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the
Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority Senior Subordinated Creditors), be
considered necessary or desirable;

(b) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of the Company, to release the
Company and any of its subsidiaries from all or any part of its Investor Liabilities on behalf of the
Investors;

(c) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of the
Company, to release:

(i) the Company and any of subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of the Investor
Liabilities; and

(ii) any Senior Subordinated Notes Only Security; and

(d) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of the Company or a holding
company of the Company and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to dispose of all or any part of the Investor Liabilities owed by the Company or
holding company or any subsidiary of the Company or holding company to execute and deliver or
enter into any agreement to dispose of all or part of those Investor Liabilities on behalf of, in each
case, the Investors.

The net proceeds of each Senior Subordinated Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any
disposal of Investor Liabilities) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the
provisions set out under the caption ‘‘—Application of proceeds’’ as if those proceeds were the proceeds
of an enforcement of the Senior Subordinated Notes Only Security and, to the extent that any disposal
of Investor Liabilities has occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities or Investor Liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Senior Subordinated Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of Investor Liabilities) effected
by, or at the request of, the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), the
Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions
(though the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone any such Senior Subordinated
Notes Distressed Disposal or disposal of Investor Liabilities in order to achieve a higher price).

**_Application of proceeds_**

_Order of application_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Recoveries (other than recoveries in respect of the Senior
Subordinated Notes Only Security) shall be applied by the Security Agent at any time as the Security

_Liabilities of the senior subordinated debt issuer_

All amounts from time to time received or recovered by the Security Agent from or in respect of the
Senior Subordinated Debt Issuer pursuant to the terms of any debt document (other than in connection
with the realization or enforcement of all or any part of the security) shall be held by the Security Agent
on trust to apply them at any time as the Security Agent (in its discretion) sees fit, to the extent permitted
by applicable law in accordance with the order of priority set out under the caption ‘‘—Application of
_proceeds—Order of application—Senior Subordinated Notes Only Security.’’_

_Debt refinancing_

The Intercreditor Agreement permits any of the liabilities under the debt documents to be refinanced,
replaced, increased or otherwise restructured in whole or in part including by way of Permitted Senior
Financing Debt and/or Permitted Subordinated Financing Debt or the issue of additional Senior Pari
Passu Notes and/or additional Senior Subordinated Notes (a ‘‘Debt Refinancing’’). Each party to the
Intercreditor Agreement shall, subject to any contrary provision of the Secured Debt Documents, be
required to enter into any amendment to or replacement of the then current Secured Debt Documents
and/or take such other action as is required by the Company in order to facilitate such a Debt
Refinancing including changes to, the taking of, or release and retake of, any guarantee or security,
subject to certain conditions. At the option of the Company, a Debt Refinancing (i) may be made
available on a basis which is senior to, pari passu with or junior to any of the other liabilities, (ii) shall
be entitled to benefit from all or any of the security, (iii) may be made available on a secured or
unsecured basis (subject to certain restrictions) and (iv) may be effected in whole or in part by way of a
debt exchange, non-cash rollover or other similar or equivalent transaction, in each case unless
otherwise prohibited by any of the Debt Financing Agreements. Under the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, each agent, each Secured Party and each Primary Creditor agrees that it shall co-operate
with the Company, each other member of the Group and each agent in order to facilitate any Debt
Refinancing (including by way of, at the request and cost of the Company, executing any document or
agreement and/or giving instructions to any person). In the event of any refinancing or replacement of
all or any part of the Senior Lender Liabilities (or any such refinancing or replacement indebtedness
from time to time), the Company shall be entitled to require that the definition of Instructing Group is
amended such that the relevant refinancing or replacement indebtedness is treated in the same manner
as the Senior Facility (meaning that for the purpose of calculating the voting entitlement of any person,
at the option of the Company all or any part of the relevant refinancing or replacement indebtedness
may be treated as Senior Pari Passu Credit Participations of the Super Priority Creditors and not Senior
Pari Passu Notes/Permitted Financing Credit Participations).

_Required consents_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, it and/or a security document
may be amended or waived only with the written consent of:

(a) if the relevant amendment or waiver (the ‘‘Proposed Amendment’’) is prohibited by the Senior
Facilities Agreement, the Senior Facility Agent (acting on the instructions of the requisite Senior
Lenders in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Senior Facilities Agreement);

(b) if the Proposed Amendment is prohibited by the terms of the relevant Senior Pari Passu Notes
Indenture, the Senior Pari Passu Notes Trustee (acting on the instructions of the requisite Senior
Pari Passu Note Holders);

(c) if any Permitted Senior Secured Financing Debt has been incurred and the Proposed Amendment
is prohibited by the terms of the relevant Permitted Senior Secured Financing Agreement, the
Senior Secured Creditor Representative in respect of that Permitted Senior Secured Financing Debt
(if applicable, acting on the instructions of the Majority Permitted Senior Secured Financing
Creditors);

(d) if any Senior Subordinated Notes have been issued and if the Proposed Amendment is prohibited
by the terms of the relevant Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture, the Senior Subordinated Notes
Trustee (acting on the instructions of the requisite Senior Subordinated Note holders);

185


-----

(e) if any Permitted Subordinated Financing Debt has been incurred and the Proposed Amendment is
prohibited by the terms of the relevant Permitted Subordinated Financing Agreement, the Senior
Subordinated Creditor Representative in respect of that Permitted Subordinated Financing Debt (if
applicable, acting on the instructions of the Majority Permitted Subordinated Financing Creditors);

(f) if a Hedge Counterparty is providing hedging to a Debtor under a hedging agreement, that Hedge
Counterparty (in each case only to the extent that the relevant amendment or waiver adversely
affects the continuing rights and/or obligations of that Hedge Counterparty and is an amendment or
waiver which is expressed to require the consent of that Hedge Counterparty under the applicable
hedging agreement, as notified by the Company to the Security Agent at the time of the relevant
amendment or waiver);

(g) the Investors; and

(h) the Company.

Any amendment or waiver of any Secured Debt Document that is made or effected in connection with
any Debt Refinancing (see ‘‘—Debt Refinancing’’), any incurrence of additional and/or refinancing debt
(as referred to in ‘‘—Ranking and Priority—Additional and/or Refinancing Debt’’) or Non-Distressed
Disposal (see ‘‘—Proceeds of disposals—Non-Distressed Disposals’’) or in connection with any other
provision of any Secured Debt Document (provided that such amendment or waiver is not expressly
prohibited by the terms of any other Secured Debt Document) is binding on all parties to the Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement or a security document may be amended by the Company and the Security
Agent without the consent of any other party, to cure defects or omissions, resolve ambiguities or
inconsistencies or reflect changes in each case of a minor, technical or administrative nature or as
otherwise for the benefit of all or any of the Secured Parties. Any amendment, waiver or consent which
relates only to the rights or obligations applicable to creditors under a particular Debt Financing
Agreement (and which does not materially and adversely affect the rights or interests of creditors under
other Debt Financing Agreements) may be approved with only the consent of the agent in respect of
that Debt Financing Agreement and the Company.

_Amendments and waivers: security documents_

Subject to the paragraph below and to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement and unless
the provisions of any debt document expressly provide otherwise, the Security Agent may, if authorized
by an Instructing Group, and if the Company consents, amend the terms of, waive any of the
requirements of or grant consents under, any of the security documents which shall be binding on each
party.

Subject to the second and third paragraphs of the section captioned ‘‘—Exceptions’’ below, any
amendment or waiver of, or consent under, any security document which would adversely affect the
nature or scope of the charged property or the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the
security are distributed requires approval as set out under the section captioned ‘‘—Required
_Consents.’’_

_Exceptions_

Subject to the following paragraph of this ‘‘—Exceptions’’ section, an amendment, waiver or consent
which adversely relates to the express rights or obligations of an agent, an arranger or the Security
Agent (in each case in such capacity) may not be effected without the consent of that agent, that
arranger or the Security Agent (as the case may be) at such time.

The foregoing shall not apply:

(a) to any release of security and/or Senior Subordinated Notes Only Security, claim or liabilities; or

(b) to any consent,

which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in accordance with the provisions set out in the caption
‘‘—Proceeds of Disposals’’ above.

186


-----

The first paragraph of this ‘‘—Exceptions’’ section shall apply to an arranger only to the extent that the
arranger liabilities are then owed to that arranger.

_Agreement to override_

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement overrides
anything in the debt documents to the contrary.

_Guarantees_

The Intercreditor Agreement additionally provides for Hedge Counterparties to receive guarantees and
indemnities from the Debtors on substantially the same terms (including the relevant limitations) as such
guarantees and indemnities are provided by the obligors to the finance parties under the Senior
Facilities Agreement.

_Equalization_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that if (but only to the extent that such transaction security is
expressed to secure those liabilities), for any reason, any Senior Pari Passu Notes Liabilities or
Permitted Senior Secured Financing Liabilities remain unpaid after the enforcement date and the
application of Recoveries and the resulting losses are not borne by the Senior Pari Passu Notes
Creditors or Permitted Senior Secured Financing Creditors in the proportions which their respective
exposures at the enforcement date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the Senior Pari Passu Notes
Creditors and Permitted Senior Pari Passu Financing Creditors at the enforcement date, the Senior Pari
Passu Notes Creditors and Permitted Senior Secured Financing Creditors will make such payments
from such Recoveries actually received amongst themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put
them in such a position that (after taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in those
proportions.

**Intrum Existing MTNs**

In February 2012, the Issuer established a Swedish law MTN program (the ‘‘Intrum Existing MTN
**Program’’) under which the Issuer has issued, and may in the future issue, unsecured medium term**
notes (the ‘‘Intrum Existing MTNs’’). Swedbank AB (publ) is the lead arranger under the Intrum Existing
MTN Program. On June 12, 2019, the Issuer published, and the Swedish Financial Supervisory
Authority (Sw. Finansinspektionen) approved in accordance with the Swedish Financial Instruments Act
(Sw. _lag (1991:980) om handel med finansiella instrument), an updated prospectus for the Intrum_
Existing MTN Program, raising the aggregate total nominal amount of Intrum Existing MTNs able to be
outstanding under the Intrum Existing MTN Program to SEK 5,000 million. As adjusted for the 2019
MTN Transactions, the Issuer has Intrum Existing MTNs outstanding as of June 30, 2019 in an
aggregate amount of SEK 3,900 million, including (i) SEK 1,000 million of Intrum Existing MTNs that
were issued on July 6, 2018, that will mature on July 6, 2020 and that bear interest at a floating rate of
STIBOR plus a margin of 1.90% per annum; (ii) SEK 2,000 million of Intrum Existing MTNs that were
issued on July 3, 2019, that will mature on July 3, 2023 and that bear interest at a floating rate of three
months STIBOR plus a margin of 3.25% per annum and (iii) SEK 900 million of Intrum Existing MTNs
that were issued on August 22, 2019, that will mature on July 3, 2023 and that bear interest at a floating
rate of three months STIBOR plus a margin of 3.25% per annum. The SEK 2,900 million Intrum Existing
MTNs due 2023 are not reflected on our balance sheet as of June 30, 2019. See ‘‘Summary—Recent
_developments—2019 MTN Transactions.’’ The Intrum Existing MTNs may not be voluntarily prepaid_
prior to their respective maturity dates. The Intrum Existing MTNs are senior unsecured obligations of
the Issuer and are not guaranteed by any of its subsidiaries.

The Intrum Existing MTNs may be issued with fixed, floating or zero coupon rate. The terms and
conditions of the Intrum Existing MTN Program contain customary restrictions, _inter alia, on security_
and guarantees, prohibiting the Issuer from providing security or guarantees (or permitting any group
company or other entity to provide security or guarantees) for market loans (including any debt
securities, loans or commercial paper that are sold or placed in an organized form and can be traded
on an exchange) issued by it, its subsidiaries or any other person. Further, the terms and conditions of
the Intrum Existing MTN Program contain customary events of default such as, inter alia, cross-default
(limited to loans exceeding €5 million), insolvency and mergers where the Issuer is not the surviving
entity, the occurrence of which would enable the issuing agent to, by written notice, declare the loans

187


-----

and any accrued interest due and payable immediately, or on such later date as the issuing agent may
decide.

**Intrum Existing Private Placement Notes**

In June 2016, the Issuer issued €160 million bonds (SEK 1,687 million equivalent) (the ‘‘Intrum
**Existing Private Placement Notes’’) (outstanding as of June 30, 2019) through a private placement**
with AB Svensk Exportkredit (‘‘AB SEK’’) (the ‘‘Private Placement’’). The Intrum Existing Private
Placement Notes are senior secured obligations of the Issuer and are not guaranteed by any of its
subsidiaries. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intrum Existing Private
Placement Notes are secured by the property securing the Revolving Credit Facility and that will secure
the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility.

The terms and conditions of the Intrum Existing Private Placement Notes contain customary restrictions,
_inter alia, on security and guarantees, prohibiting the Issuer from providing security or guarantees (or_
permitting any group company or other entity to provide security or guarantees) for market loans
(including any debt securities, loans or commercial paper that are sold or placed in an organized form
and can be traded on an exchange) issued by it, its subsidiaries or any other person. Further, the terms
and conditions of the Intrum Existing Private Placement Notes contain customary events of default such
as, inter alia, cross-default (limited to loans exceeding €5 million), insolvency and mergers where the
Issuer is not the surviving entity, the occurrence of which would enable AB SEK to, by written notice,
declare the loans and any accrued interest due and payable immediately, or on such later date as the
issuing agent may decide.

Furthermore, the Issuer and AB SEK have, in connection with the Private Placement, entered into a
side letter stipulating, inter alia, that certain financial covenants included in the Revolving Credit Facility
(or any agreement replacing the Revolving Credit Facility) shall apply also to the Intrum Existing Private
Placement Notes. Accordingly AB SEK benefits from the same financial covenants included in the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. See ‘‘—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.’’

The Intrum Existing Private Placement Notes mature in June 2023 and may not be voluntarily prepaid
prior to their maturity date. The Intrum Existing Private Placement Notes bear interest at a floating rate
of EURIBOR (3 months) plus a margin on commercial and competitive terms.

**Intrum Existing Commercial Paper**

In 2011, the Issuer established a Swedish law commercial paper program (the ‘‘Intrum Existing
**Commercial Paper Program’’) under which the Issuer has issued, and may in the future issue,**
unsecured commercial paper (‘‘Intrum Existing Commercial Paper’’). Nordea Bank AB (publ) and
Swedbank AB (publ) are the issuing agents under the Intrum Justitia Existing Commercial Paper
Program. The aggregate total nominal amount of Intrum Justitia Existing Commercial Paper outstanding
under the Intrum Existing Commercial Paper Program may not exceed SEK 4,000 million. As of June
30, 2019, the Issuer has Intrum Existing Commercial Paper outstanding in an aggregate amount of SEK
2,480 million was (€235 million equivalent). The Intrum Existing Commercial Paper is a unsecured
obligation of the Issuer and is not guaranteed by any of its subsidiaries.

The terms and conditions of the Intrum Existing Commercial Paper Program contain customary
restrictions, _inter alia, on security and guarantees, prohibiting the Issuer from providing security or_
guarantees (or permitting any group company or other entity to provide security or guarantees) for
market loans (including any debt securities, loans or commercial paper that are sold or placed in an
organized form and can be traded on an exchange) issued by it, its subsidiaries or any other person.
Further, the terms and conditions of the Intrum Existing Commercial Paper contain customary events
of default such as, _inter alia, cross-default (limited to loans exceeding €5 million), insolvency and_
insolvency proceedings, the occurrence of which would enable the issuing agents to, by written notice
by noteholders representing at least 10% of the total adjusted nominal amount, declare the loans and
any accrued interest due and payable immediately.

The Intrum Existing Commercial Paper is frequently issued with an average term of three months,
though the term may vary between one and 12 months. The Intrum Existing Commercial Paper bears
interest at an average all-in rate of 0.28% per annum.

**Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement**

On July 18, 2019, the Issuer entered into a multicurrency revolving credit facility agreement (the
‘‘Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement’’) with, among others, Swedbank AB (publ), as
facility agent and security agent, and Danske Bank A/S, Danmark, Sverige Filial, DNB Bank ASA,
Nordea Bank Abp, filial i Sverige, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (publ) and Swedbank AB (publ),
as lenders, in order to provide a backstop facility for the Intrum Existing Commercial Paper Program.
Pursuant to the terms of the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Issuer’s subsidiaries
which are guarantors under the Revolving Credit Facility shall accede to the Backstop Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement within 90 days from the date of the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

**_Commitments_**

The total commitments under the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are SEK
2,000,000,000, of which SEK 250,000,000 may be utilized as swing line loans.

**_Borrower and Borrowings_**

The facilities under Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are available for borrowing by the
Issuer. It is a condition of utilization of the commitments under the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement that the Revolving Credit Facility (or any facility replacing such) has been utilized in an
amount not less than 95% of the available commitments thereunder.

**_Purpose_**

Utilization under a facility may only be applied by the Issuer as a backstop to the Intrum Existing
Commercial Paper Program or for general corporate purposes.

**_Guarantees and security_**

The obligations under the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will be guaranteed by the
Issuer and the same subsidiaries of the Issuer that guarantee the Revolving Credit Facility, and will be
secured (within 90 days from the date of the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) with
substantially the same collateral that secures the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Repayment of borrowings and maturity_**

The original termination date under the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is the first
anniversary of the date of the agreement. The Issuer may request a one-time extension of the original
termination date to the first anniversary of the original termination date (which extension, with respect
to any lender, will be at the option of the given lender).

**_Interest rate and fees_**

The rate of interest on each loan for each interest period under the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement is the percentage rate per annum which is the aggregate of 2.50% per annum and the
applicable IBOR with a 0.65% commitment fee payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled
amount of the revolving credit facility commitments thereunder.

**_Other terms_**

The other material terms of the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, including the financial
covenant, the undertakings and the events of default, are substantially the same as the terms of the
Revolving Credit Facility. The Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement prevents the incurrence of
secured indebtedness by the Issuer that ranks pari passu with, or senior to, the indebtedness incurred
thereunder (other than any indebtedness incurred under the Revolving Credit Facility), and prevents
the Issuer from amending the terms of indebtedness outstanding on the date of the Backstop Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement the effect of which would be that such indebtedness ranks pari passu with or
senior to the indebtedness incurred under the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (provided
the Issuer may incur secured _pari passu_ indebtedness up to €250 million). Any reference to
indebtedness ranking pari passu with the indebtedness incurred under the Backstop Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement means indebtedness which (i) is secured and (ii) ranks in right and priority with the

189


-----

liabilities thereunder as set out in Clause 13.1 (Order of application—Transaction Security (other than
_Shared Security)) or Clause 13.2 (Order of application—Shared Security) of the Intercreditor_
Agreement. The Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is governed by Swedish law.

**Existing Notes**

On June 26, 2017, the Issuer issued senior notes comprised of the following tranches (outstanding as

Issuer’s existing and future indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Existing
Notes and rank senior in right of payment to any and all of the existing and future indebtedness of the
Issuer that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Existing Notes. The Existing Notes are
unsecured and effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured indebtedness of the Issuer,
including any amounts owing under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility,
the Intrum Existing Private Placement Notes and certain hedging arrangements, to the extent of the
value of assets securing such indebtedness. The Existing Notes are not guaranteed by any of the

subsidiaries, including such subsidiaries’ obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Backstop
Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging arrangements.

under other debt instruments which (i) are caused by the failure to pay principal on the indebtedness at
its stated maturity prior to expiration of any applicable grace period or (ii) result in the acceleration of
such indebtedness prior to its maturity, and, in each case, the principal amount of such indebtedness
(together with the principal amount of any other such indebtedness under which there has been a
payment default or the maturity of which has been accelerated) aggregates €55 million or more.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

The following is a description of the €850 million in aggregate principal amount of 3% Senior Notes due
2027 (the “Notes”).

The Notes will be issued by Intrum AB (publ) (formerly Intrum Justitia AB (publ)), a company
incorporated in Sweden (the “Issuer”).

In this “Description of the Notes,” the “Issuer” refers only to Intrum AB (publ), and any successor obligor
to Intrum AB (publ) under the Indenture, and not to any of its Subsidiaries. You can find the definitions
of certain terms used in this description under “—Certain Definitions.”

The proceeds of the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used by the Issuer as set forth
in this Offering Memorandum under the caption “Use of Proceeds.”

The Issuer will issue the Notes under an indenture, to be dated as of the Issue Date (the “Indenture”),
among, inter alios, the Issuer and Citibank, N.A., London Branch as trustee (the “Trustee”). The Notes
will be issued in private transactions that are not subject to the registration requirements of the
Securities Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.” The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture.
The Indenture will not be qualified under, and will not incorporate any provision of, or be subject to the
terms of, the Trust Indenture Act. The Notes are subject to all such terms pursuant to the provisions of
the Indenture, and Holders are referred to the Indenture for a statement thereof.

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Notes and refers to the
Intercreditor Agreement and does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to, all provisions of the Indenture, the Notes and the Intercreditor Agreement,
respectively. Because this is a summary, it may not contain all the information that is important to you.
You should read the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement in their entirety. Copies of the Indenture
and the Intercreditor Agreement are available as described under “Listing and General Information—
_Admission to trading and listing.”_

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. In general, only
registered Holders will have rights under the Indenture.

**Brief Description of the Notes**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes offered hereby:

- will be senior obligations of the Issuer and will rank equal in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s
existing and future obligations that are not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including
obligations under the Existing Notes, the RCF Facility Agreement, the Backstop RCF Agreement,
certain Hedging Obligations, the MTNs, the Private Placement Notes and the Commercial Paper
Program;

- will be senior in right of payment to any Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer;

- will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured obligations of the Issuer, including
obligations under the RCF Facility Agreement, the Private Placement Notes, the Backstop RCF
Agreement (upon the granting of security) and certain Hedging Obligations, to the extent of the
value of the property and assets securing such obligations; and

- will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that are not
Guarantors, including such subsidiaries’ obligations under the RCF Facility Agreement, the Private
Placement Notes and the Backstop RCF Agreement (upon granting of the guarantees).

Initially, none of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will Guarantee the Notes and the Issuer will not have any
obligation to cause any of its Subsidiaries to Guarantee the Notes in the future (except as required
under the circumstances described below under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries; Future Guarantors)”._

192


-----

Substantially all the operations of the Issuer are conducted through its Subsidiaries. Claims of creditors
of non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt
and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any)
of those Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those
Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and any Guarantor, including Holders. The Notes
and any Guarantee thereof will be effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors and
the obligations under the RCF Facility Agreement, the Private Placement Notes (to the extent of the
value of the property and assets of the relevant subsidiaries of the Issuer securing the Private
Placement Notes), the Backstop RCF Agreement and certain Hedging Obligations) and preferred and
minority stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than any Guarantor). As of June 30,
2019, after giving effect to the Transactions, the Issuer’s Subsidiaries would have had no external debt,
including interest-bearing notes, loans and borrowings (but excluding trade payables, liens, shareholder
loans and finance lease obligations), other than the Guarantees of Indebtedness under the RCF Facility
Agreement and the Backstop RCF Agreement. Although the Indenture will limit the incurrence of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject
to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the
incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the Notes to receive the payments on such Notes are
subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking,
société anonyme (“Clearstream”). If the due date for any payment or redemption in respect of any Notes
is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not
be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and
will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**Principal and maturity**

The Issuer will issue €850 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes in this Offering on the Issue
Date. The Notes will mature on September 15, 2027. The Notes will be issued in minimum
denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes shall be
treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including with respect to waivers,
amendments or other modifications of the Indenture or any other action by the Holders, except as
otherwise provide in the Indenture.

**Interest**

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of 3.000% per annum and will:

- accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was
most recently paid;

- be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15, commencing on March
15, 2020;

- be payable to the Holder of record of Notes on the Clearing System Business Day immediately
preceding the related interest payment date, or to the extent certificated securities (“Definitive
_Registered Notes”) have been issued, to the Holders of record of the Notes on the Business Day_
immediately preceding the related interest payment date; and

- be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

**Additional Notes**

The Issuer may issue an unlimited principal amount of additional Notes having identical terms and
conditions as the Notes (the “Additional Notes”) so long as such issuance is in compliance with the
covenants contained in the Indenture, including the covenant restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness
(as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”). The Notes issued in
this Offering and, if issued, any Additional Notes will be treated as a single class for all purposes under
the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and
offers to purchase, except as otherwise provided for in the Indenture. Unless the context otherwise

193


-----

requires, in this “Description of the Notes,” references to “Notes” include the Notes offered hereby and
any Additional Notes that are actually issued under the Indenture.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts (defined below), if any, on the Global Notes
(as defined below) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents;
_provided that all such payments with respect to Notes represented by one or more Global Notes_
registered in the name of or held by a nominee of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, will be made
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the Holder or Holders thereof.

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on any Definitive Registered Notes
will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents in London, in each case,
maintained for such purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid by

See “—Paying Agent and Registrars for the Notes.”

**Paying Agent and Registrars for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each a “Paying Agent”) for the Notes, including a
Paying Agent in London (the “Principal Paying Agent”). The initial Principal Paying Agent for the Notes
will be Citibank, N.A., London Branch.

The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar”). The Issuer will also maintain
a transfer agent in London. The initial Registrar in respect of the Notes will be Citibank, N.A., London
Branch (the “Registrar”) and the initial transfer agent will be Citibank, N.A., London Branch. The
Registrar, Paying Agent and transfer agent, as applicable, will maintain a register reflecting ownership
of Definitive Registered Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and will make payments on and
facilitate transfers of Definitive Registered Notes on behalf of the Issuer. Each transfer agent shall
perform the functions of a transfer agent.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer agent for the Notes without prior notice
to Holders. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the
Notes. Notice of any change in a Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent may be published on the
[official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu), to the extent and in the manner](http://www.bourse.lu/)
permitted by the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will initially be issued as follows:

- The Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers (“QIBs”) pursuant to Rule
144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by global notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”).

- The Notes sold outside the United States to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the
Securities Act will initially be represented by global notes in registered form without interest coupons
attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global
_Notes”)._

- The Global Notes will, upon issuance, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee
of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.
Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions
on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer
_Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or_
participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, pursuant to
customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, and their respective participants.

194


-----

No Book-Entry Interest in any Global Note representing one series of Notes and no Definitive
Registered Note issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest in such series of Notes may be transferred
or exchanged for any Book-Entry Interest in any Global Note representing another series of Notes or
any Definitive Registered Note issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest in another series of Notes.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes only upon delivery by the transferor of a
written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made
in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Prior to 40 days after the date of initial issuance of the Notes, ownership of Book Entry Interests in
Regulation S Global Notes will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream
or persons who hold interests through Euroclear or Clearstream, and any sale or transfer of such
interest to U.S. persons shall not be permitted during such period unless such resale or transfer is made
pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. During the 40 day distribution compliance period, Book
Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (“Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”) may be
transferred only to non U.S. persons in compliance with Regulation S of the Securities Act or to persons
whom the transferor reasonably believes are “qualified institutional buyers” within the meaning of Rule
144A under the Securities Act in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A under the
Securities Act or otherwise in accordance with applicable transfer restrictions and any applicable
securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction. Subject to the foregoing,
Regulation S Book Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
Book Entry Interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a
person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of
Rule 144A under the Securities Act in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A under the
Securities Act or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer
_Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction._

Any Book Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will,
upon transfer, cease to be a Book Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and
will become a Book Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and
after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures
applicable to Book Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of
€100,000 aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, in each case,
upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other
documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon
directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant that owns the
relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest
will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer to be in compliance
with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer
summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes
may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in
aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any
such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among
other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information
regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, to furnish certain
certificates and opinions, and to pay any taxes, duties and governmental charges in connection with
such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder,
other than any taxes, duties and governmental charges payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any
Definitive Registered Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of such Notes;

195


-----

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of such Notes to be
redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date applicable
to such Notes; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not validly withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a
Change of Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Paying Agents and the transfer agent will be entitled to treat
the Holder of a Note as the owner of it for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

As of the Issue Date all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. In the circumstances
described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the Issuer will be permitted to
designate other Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not
be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture.

**Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

In connection with the Incurrence of certain Indebtedness by the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries, the Trustee shall, at the request of the Issuer, enter into with the Issuer, the relevant
Restricted Subsidiaries and the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives)
one or more intercreditor agreements or deeds (including a restatement, replacement, amendment or
other modification of the Intercreditor Agreement) (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”), on
substantially similar terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms that are not materially less favorable
to the Holders); _provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal_
obligations on the Trustee or adversely affect the personal rights, duties, liabilities, indemnification or
immunities of the Trustee under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement. In connection with the
foregoing, the Issuer shall furnish to the Trustee such documentation in relation thereto as it may
reasonably require.

In relation to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee shall
consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance,
acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided,
however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant described herein under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”_

The Indenture will also provide that, at the written direction of the Issuer and without the consent of
Holders, the Trustee shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or
inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer
or its Restricted Subsidiaries that is subject to the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (provided that such Indebtedness is Incurred in compliance with the Indenture), (3) add
Guarantors or other Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, (4) secure the Notes (including Additional Notes) or (5) make any other change
to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect. The Issuer
shall not otherwise direct the Trustee to enter into any amendment to the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under “—
_Amendments and Waivers” or as permitted by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional_
Intercreditor Agreement, and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee to enter into any amendment to the
extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or, in the opinion of
the Trustee, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Indenture,
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed
to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or
entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have authorized the

196


-----

Trustee to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or any
restatement, replacement, amendment or other modification to reflect the above on each Holder’s
behalf and the Trustee will not be required to seek the consent of the Holders to perform its obligations
under and in accordance with the above provisions.

A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement and/or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made
available to the Holders upon request to the Issuer.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth herein and under “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons,” the Notes are not
redeemable at the option of the Issuer.

At any time prior to September 15, 2022, the Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole or in part, at its
option, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 100%
of the principal amount of such Notes plus the relevant Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and
unpaid interest to, the redemption date, and Additional Amounts, if any.

At any time and from time to time on or after September 15, 2022, the Issuer may redeem the Notes in
whole or in part, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, at a redemption price equal
to the percentage of principal amount set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the
redemption date and Additional Amounts, if any:

**Twelve-month period commencing on September 15,** **Percentage**

2022 ........................................................................................................................ 101.500%

2023 ........................................................................................................................ 100.750%

2024 and thereafter ................................................................................................. 100.000%

At any time and from time to time prior to September 15, 2022, the Issuer may redeem the Notes upon
not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, with the net cash proceeds received by the Issuer
from any Equity Offering at a redemption price equal to 103.000% plus accrued and unpaid interest to
the redemption date and Additional Amounts, if any, in an aggregate principal amount for all such
redemptions not to exceed 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including
Additional Notes), provided that:

(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related
Equity Offering; and

(2) not less than 50% of the original principal amount of the Notes being redeemed (including the
principal amount of any Additional Notes) remain outstanding immediately thereafter.

**_General_**

Any redemption and notice of redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction
of one or more conditions precedent (including, without limitation, in the case of a redemption related
to an Equity Offering, the consummation of such Equity Offering and, in the case of a redemption of the
Notes, the incurrence of Indebtedness the proceeds of which will be used to redeem the Notes). In
addition, if such redemption or notice is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent,
such notice may state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such
time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived (provided, however, that, in any case,
such redemption date shall be no more than 60 days from the date on which such notice is first given),
or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such
conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived by the redemption date, or by the redemption date
so delayed.

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of the Notes, it will, for so long as the Notes are listed on
the Securities Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange so require, inform the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of such optional redemption and confirm
the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that will remain outstanding immediately after such
redemption.

197


-----

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest
payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is
registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to
Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

In connection with any tender offer or other offer to purchase for all of the Notes, if Holders of not less
than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding Notes validly tender and do not
validly withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such tender
offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by such
Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’
notice following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such
purchase at a price equal to the price paid to each other Holder in such tender offer (other than any
incentive payment for early tenders), plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment,
accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but not including, the repurchase date (subject to the
right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date). In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount
of the then-outstanding Notes have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Notes in a tender offer
or other offer to purchase for all of the Notes, as applicable, Notes owned by an affiliate of the Issuer or
by funds controlled or managed by any affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed
to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer or other offer, as applicable.

If the Issuer elects to redeem the Notes or portions thereof and, in connection with a satisfaction and
discharge of, or defeasance of, the Indenture, requests that the Trustee distribute to the Holders
amounts deposited in trust with the Trustee (which, for the avoidance of doubt, will include accrued and
unpaid interest to the date fixed for redemption) prior to the date fixed for redemption in accordance
with the provisions set forth under “—Defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge,” the applicable
redemption notice will state (i) that Holders will receive such amounts deposited in trust with the Trustee
prior to the date fixed for redemption and (ii) such earlier payment date.

**Sinking Fund**

The Issuer will not be required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Notes.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee or the Registrar, as applicable,
will select the Notes for redemption in compliance with the rules and procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, or (i) if such Notes are not held through Euroclear or Clearstream, on a pro rata basis or
(ii) if Euroclear or Clearstream prescribe no method of selection, by use of a pool factor; _provided,_
however, that no Note of €100,000 or less in aggregate principal amount shall be redeemed in part and
only Notes in integral multiples of €1,000 will be redeemed. Neither the Trustee nor the Registrar will
be liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

The Issuer shall publish notice of redemption in accordance with the prevailing rules of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange applicable to the Securities Official List and in addition to such publication, not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, mail such notice to Holders by first-class
mail, postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as they appear on the registration books of the
Registrar or deliver such notice in accordance with the rules and procedures of Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, in lieu of the aforesaid mailing.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state
the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case the unredeemed portion of
the original Note will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note.
In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal
amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the
applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein), Notes called for redemption
become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to
accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer or Successor Issuer, as defined below, may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at
any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice to the Holders (which notice will
be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject
to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (see “—Withholding Taxes”), if any, then due and
which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise if the
Issuer, Successor Issuer or Guarantor determine in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaty (or any regulations, protocols or rulings
promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below under “—
_Withholding Taxes”); or_

(2) any change in, or amendment to, or the introduction of, an official position regarding the
application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including
a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
(each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

the Issuer, Successor Issuer or Guarantor are, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the
Notes would be, required to pay any Additional Amounts, and such obligation cannot be avoided by
taking reasonable measures available to the Issuer, Successor Issuer or Guarantor (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable and not
result in any material legal or regulatory burden or any significant additional costs but not including
assignment of the obligation to make payment with respect to the Notes). In the case of redemption due
to withholding as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that is a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
at the date of this Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must be publicly announced and
become effective on or after the date of this Offering Memorandum. In the case of redemption due to
withholding as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that becomes a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction after the date of this Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must become
effective on or after the date the jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, unless the Change
in Tax Law would have applied to the predecessor of the Successor Issuer. Notice of redemption for
taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under “—Selection and
_Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90_
days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obliged to make such payment of Additional
Amounts if a payment in respect of the Notes were then due and (b) unless at the time such notice is
given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or
mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer or Successor
Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such
redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right to so
redeem have been satisfied and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing
to the effect that the Issuer, Successor Issuer or Guarantor has or have been or will become obligated
to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept such Officer’s
Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described
above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

The foregoing will apply _mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to the Issuer is_
incorporated or organized or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on account of the Issuer, a Successor Issuer or a Guarantor (a “Payor”) on
the Notes or any Note Guarantees, as defined below, will be made free and clear of and without
withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such
Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed
or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) Sweden or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having power to
tax;

199


-----

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Guarantee is made by the
Issuer, Successor Issuer, Guarantor or their agents on their behalf, or any political subdivision or
Governmental Authority thereof or therein having the power to tax; or

(3) any other jurisdiction in which the Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in a trade or
business for tax purposes or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political
subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause
(1), (2) and (3), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required from any payments made by a Payor with respect to any Note or Guarantee,
including payments of principal, redemption price, premium, if any, or interest, the Payor will pay
(together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be
necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by the Holders or the
Trustee, as the case may be, after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or
withholding from such Additional Amounts), will equal the amounts which would have been received in
respect of such payments on any such Note or Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or
deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner of a Note (or between a fiduciary,
settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder or
beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership,
limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including being a
citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent
establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in
each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or
the receipt of any payment in respect thereof;

(2) any Taxes to the extent that they are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or
the beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a written request of the Payor addressed to the
Holder, after reasonable notice, to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence
concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make
any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters,
which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of withholding or deduction
of, all or part of such Taxes;

(3) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment on or with
respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee;

(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, value added, use, excise, transfer, personal property or similar
tax, assessment or other governmental charge;

(5) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Note presented for payment (where presentation is
permitted or required for payment) by or on behalf of a Holder or beneficial owner who would have
been able to avoid such Tax by presenting the relevant Note to, or otherwise accepting payment
from, another paying agent;

(6) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to a payment to any Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership
or any Person other than the sole beneficial owner of payment or such Notes to the extent that the
beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial
owner of such Notes would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary,
settlor, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly;

(7) any Taxes withheld or deducted pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any
amended or successor version of such Sections), any U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated
thereunder, any official interpretations thereof or any agreements (including an intergovernmental
agreement or any law implementing any such agreement) entered into in connection with the
implementation thereof; or

(8) any combination of the above.

200


-----

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable (x) if the payment could have been made without
such deduction or withholding if the beneficiary of the payment had presented the Note for payment
(where presentation is permitted or required for payment) within 30 days after the relevant payment was
first made available for payment to the Holder or (y) where, had the beneficial owner of the Note been
the Holder, such beneficial owner would not have been entitled to payment of Additional Amounts by
reason of any of clauses (1) to (8) inclusive above.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all
reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so
deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, in such form as
provided in the ordinary course by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and as is reasonably available to
the Issuer and will provide such certified copies to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made available to
the Holders upon request. The Payor shall attach to each certified copy or other evidence, as applicable,
a certificate stating (x) that the amount of Tax evidenced by the certified copy was paid in connection
with payments under or with respect to the Notes then outstanding upon which such Taxes were due
and (y) the amount of such withholding tax paid per €1,000 of principal amount of the Notes.

If any Payor becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to
any payment made on any Note or Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the
Payor will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be
payable and the amount so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent
to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay
Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor
may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to
the payment date). The Trustee will be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive
proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in either the Indenture, any Guarantees or this “Description of the Notes” there are mentioned,
in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this
heading to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect
thereof.

The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes, or any other property or
similar taxes, charges or levies (including interest and penalties to the extent resulting from a failure by
the Payor to timely pay amounts due) that arise in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction or any jurisdiction
in which a Paying Agent is located from the execution, delivery, registration or enforcement of any
Notes, the Indenture, the Security Documents or any other document or instrument in relation thereto
(other than a transfer of the Notes), and the Payor agrees to indemnify the Holders for any such taxes
paid by such Holders. The Payor will also pay any such taxes, charges, or levies arising in any taxing
jurisdiction in connection with the enforcement of the Notes, or any other such document or instrument,
following the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Notes.

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and
will apply _mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to the Issuer is organized or_
resident for tax purposes or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms hereof, each Holder will have the right to require the
Issuer to repurchase all or part (in integral multiples of €1,000; provided that Notes of €100,000 or less

201


-----

in aggregate principal amount may only be repurchased in whole and not in part) of such Holder’s Notes
at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid
interest to the date of purchase and Additional Amounts, if any (subject to the right of Holders of record
on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided,
however, that the Issuer shall not be obliged to repurchase Notes as described under this “—Change
_of Control” section in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem_
all of the Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have
been satisfied or waived.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under “—
_Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than_
the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice (the “Change of Control
_Offer”) to each Holder of any such Notes, with a copy to the Trustee:_

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to
require the Issuer to purchase such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of
the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date
of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the
relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the
date such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Change of Control;

(4) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder
must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(5) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of
Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will,
to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Principal Paying Agents an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in
respect of all Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal
amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Principal Paying Agents the
Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been
tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar
for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder
of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the
Trustee or the Registrar as applicable will promptly authenticate (or cause to be authenticated) and mail
(or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Note
equal in aggregate principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any;
_provided that each such new Note will be in an aggregate principal amount that is at least €100,000_
and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Securities Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will, to the extent and in the manner permitted by
such rules, post such notices on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

202


-----

The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other
provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of
Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer
repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The
existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the
occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its
Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third
party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with
the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer
and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in
advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a
definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control, or an offer or other transaction that if
consummated would result in a Change of Control has been publicly announced and, if applicable, not
withdrawn, at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act and any other applicable securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which the Notes
are then listed) in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that
the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of the
Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations (or exchange rules)
and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the
Indenture by virtue of the conflict.

Under the RCF Facility Agreement, the occurrence of a change of control would require the repayment
of such indebtedness. Future debt of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may prohibit the Issuer from
purchasing Notes in the event of a Change of Control or provide that a Change of Control is a default
or require repurchase upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to
require the Issuer to purchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, other
debt, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of the purchase on the
Issuer.

The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be
limited to the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes—
_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes_
_upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the Indenture.”_

Holders may not be entitled to require the Issuer to purchase their Notes in certain circumstances
involving a significant change in the composition of the Issuer’s board of directors, including in
connection with a proxy contest.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and
assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons.
Although there is limited case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise
established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be
unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer
to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders
of a majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes under the Indenture.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness); _provided, however, that the Issuer and any of its Restricted_
Subsidiaries may Incur Indebtedness if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma effect
thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof) as if the additional Indebtedness had
been Incurred at the beginning of the relevant four quarter period, the Consolidated Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio for the Issuer’s most recently ended four fiscal quarters for which internal consolidated
financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional
Indebtedness is Incurred is at least 2.0 to 1.0; provided further that the aggregate principal amount of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this paragraph and clause (11) of the next paragraph by Restricted
Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors shall not exceed the greater of 6.4% of ERC and €300 million at
any one time outstanding.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness:

(1) Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility (including letters of credit or bankers’
acceptances issued or created under any Credit Facility), and any Refinancing Indebtedness in
respect thereof and Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness in a maximum aggregate
principal amount at any time outstanding not exceeding (a) the greater of (i) €1,100 million and
(ii) 35% of ERC, plus (b) in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this
clause (1) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums
and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(2)

(a) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary so long as (i) the Incurrence of such Indebtedness being guaranteed is
permitted under the terms of the Indenture, (ii) if the Indebtedness being guaranteed is
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or to a Note Guarantee then such Guarantee
must be subordinated to the same extent as the Indebtedness being guaranteed and (iii) if the
Indebtedness being guaranteed is Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor, such Restricted
Subsidiary complies with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Guarantees of
_Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries; Future Guarantors;” or_

(b) without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens,” Indebtedness arising by
reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing Indebtedness of the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under
the terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; _provided,_
however, that:

(a) if the Issuer or any Guarantor is the obligor under such Indebtedness and the obligee is not
the Issuer or a Guarantor, such Indebtedness is unsecured and ((i) except in respect of the
intercompany current liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business in connection with
the cash management operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries and (ii) only
to the extent legally permitted (the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries having completed
all procedures required in the reasonable judgment of directors of officers of the obligee or
obligor to protect such Persons from any penalty or civil or criminal liability in connection
with the subordination of such Indebtedness)) expressly subordinated in right of payment to
prior payment in full in cash (whether upon Stated Maturity, acceleration or otherwise) and
the performance in full of its obligations under the Notes and the Indenture; and

(b) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in
any such Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer and (ii) any sale or other transfer of any such
Indebtedness to a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer,

204


-----

shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness by the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4) Indebtedness represented by (a)(i) the Notes (other than any Additional Notes) and any Note
Guarantees thereof, (ii) the Existing Notes (including the portion of the Existing Notes that will be
redeemed in accordance with the Transactions until the portion is redeemed in accordance with
the Transactions), the MTNs, the Private Placement Notes and the Commercial Paper Program,
in each case, outstanding on the Issue Date and (iii) any “parallel debt” obligation under the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (b) any Indebtedness (other
than Indebtedness described in clauses (1) and (3) of this paragraph) outstanding on the Issue
Date after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions and (c) Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred
in respect of any Indebtedness described in sub-clause (a), (b) or (c) of this clause (4) or clause
(5) of this paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant;

(5) Indebtedness (a) of any Person Incurred and outstanding on the date on which such Person
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or is
merged, consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise combined with (including pursuant to any
acquisition of assets and assumption of related liabilities) the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
(other than Indebtedness Incurred in connection with, or to provide all or any portion of the funds
utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such
Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary) or (b) Incurred by the Issuer to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to
consummate the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person
became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary; provided, however, with respect to each of clause (5)(a) and (5)(b), that at the time of
such acquisition or other transaction (i) the Issuer would have been able to Incur €1.00 of
additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant after giving effect to the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (5) or (ii) the Consolidated Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio of the Issuer would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to
such acquisition or other transaction;

(6) Indebtedness under Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements and Commodity Hedging
Agreements entered into for _bona fide hedging purposes of the Issuer or its Restricted_
Subsidiaries and not for speculative purposes (as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors or Senior Management of the Issuer);

(7) Indebtedness represented by Capitalized Lease Obligations or Purchase Money Obligations, and
in each case any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof, in an aggregate outstanding
principal amount which, when taken together with the principal amount of all other Indebtedness
Incurred pursuant to this clause (7) and then outstanding, will not exceed at any time the greater
of (A) €150 million and (B) 2.4% of Total Assets;

(8) Indebtedness in respect of (a) workers’ compensation claims, self-insurance obligations,
performance, indemnity, surety, judgment, appeal, advance payment, customs, VAT or other tax

and warranties provided by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or relating to liabilities,
obligations or guarantees Incurred in the ordinary course of business or in respect of any
governmental requirement, (b) letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, guarantees or other similar
instruments or obligations issued or relating to liabilities or obligations Incurred in the ordinary
course of business or in respect of any governmental requirement; provided, however, that upon
the drawing of such letters of credit or similar instruments, the obligations are reimbursed within
30 days following such drawing, (c) the financing of insurance premiums in the ordinary course of
business and (d) any customary cash management, cash pooling or netting or setting off
arrangements in the ordinary course of business;

(9) Indebtedness arising from agreements providing for customary guarantees, indemnification,
obligations in respect of earn-outs or other adjustments of purchase price or, in each case, similar
obligations, in each case, Incurred or assumed in connection with the acquisition or disposition of
any business or assets or Person or any Capital Stock of a Subsidiary (other than Guarantees of
Indebtedness Incurred by any Person acquiring or disposing of such business or assets or such
Subsidiary for the purpose of financing such acquisition or disposition); provided that, in the case

205


-----

of a disposition, the maximum liability of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of all
such Indebtedness shall at no time exceed the gross proceeds, including the fair market value of
non-cash proceeds (measured at the time received and without giving effect to any subsequent
changes in value), actually received by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection
with such disposition;

(10)

(a) Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check,

Restricted Subsidiaries; and

(d) Indebtedness incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary in connection with bankers acceptances,
discounted bills of exchange or the discounting or factoring of receivables of the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary for credit management of bad debt purposes, in each case incurred
or undertaken in the ordinary course of business on arm’s length commercial terms on a
recourse basis;

(11) Indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and the aggregate principal amount of all other
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (11) and then outstanding, will not exceed the
greater of €365 million and 9.5% of ERC; _provided that the aggregate principal amount of_
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (11) and under the first paragraph of this covenant
by Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors shall not exceed the greater of €300 million
and 6.4% of ERC at any one time outstanding;

(12) Indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and the principal amount of all other Indebtedness
Incurred pursuant to this clause (12) and then outstanding, will not exceed 100% of the Net Cash
Proceeds received by the Issuer from the issuance or sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary)
of its Subordinated Shareholder Funding or its Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock,
Designated Preference Shares or an Excluded Contribution) or otherwise contributed to the equity
(other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock, Designated Preference Shares or an
Excluded Contribution) of the Issuer, in each case, subsequent to the Issue Date; _provided,_
however, that (i) any such Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be
excluded for purposes of making Restricted Payments under the first paragraph and clauses (1)
and (6)(ii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described below under “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments” to the extent the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries Incur Indebtedness_
in reliance thereon and (ii) any Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be
excluded for purposes of Incurring Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (12) to the extent the
Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries makes a Restricted Payment under the first paragraph
and clauses (1) and (6)(ii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described below under “—
_Limitation on Restricted Payments” in reliance thereon;_

(13) Indebtedness Incurred by a Receivables Subsidiary in a Qualified Receivables Financing;

206


-----

(15) Indebtedness consisting of local lines of credit or working capital facilities not to exceed the greater
of 2.1% of ERC and €100 million outstanding at any one time.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness
described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will
classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to
include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second paragraph
or the first paragraph of this covenant;

(2) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date under the RCF Facility Agreement shall be
deemed Incurred on the Issue Date under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the description
of this covenant and not the first paragraph or clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the
description of this covenant;

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments or any “parallel debt” obligation relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is
otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be
included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1),
(7), (11), (12) or (15) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters
of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then
such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory
redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase
premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one
provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and
in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; and

(7) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be
equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization
of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment
of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the
reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will
not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this
“—Limitation on Indebtedness.” The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be
calculated as specified under the definition of “Indebtedness.”

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date.

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro- or SEK-denominated (as applicable) restriction
on the Incurrence of Indebtedness (including any Indebtedness to be Incurred under the first paragraph
of this covenant or by reference to a percentage of ERC or Total Assets) or for purposes of calculating
the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or Consolidated Leverage Ratio for any other purpose
under the Indenture, in each applicable case, the euro or SEK equivalent of the aggregate principal
amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term
Indebtedness or, at the option of the Issuer, first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower
euro or SEK equivalent, as applicable), in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit
facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated
in a currency other than euro or SEK, as applicable, and such refinancing would cause the applicable

207


-----

ratio or euro- or SEK-denominated restriction, as applicable, to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such ratio or euro- or
SEK-denominated restriction, as applicable, shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as
the aggregate principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the aggregate
principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus the aggregate amount of fees,
underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, premiums (including tender premiums) and other
costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in
connection with such refinancing; (b) subject to clause (c) below, the euro or SEK equivalent of the
aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated
based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if and for so long as
any such Indebtedness is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in which such
Indebtedness is denominated covering all or any portion the principal and interest on such
Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro or SEK, as applicable, will be
adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be
exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of
any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the
Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to
the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of
such refinancing.

Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor (if any) will incur any Indebtedness (including any Indebtedness
permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the second paragraph of this covenant) that is contractually
subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any such Guarantor unless
such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and the applicable
Guarantee thereof on substantially identical terms (as determined in good faith by the Issuer); provided,
however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to
any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured, by virtue of
being secured with different collateral, by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis, by virtue of
being guaranteed by different obligors or by virtue of the application of waterfall or other
payment-ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness under Credit Facilities.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on or in respect of the Issuer’s or any

therefrom);

succeeding paragraph, but excluding all other Restricted Payments permitted by the second
succeeding paragraph) would exceed the sum of (without duplication):

Payment for which internal consolidated financial statements are available (or, in the
case such Consolidated Net Income is a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit);

(ii) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds, and the fair market value (as determined
in accordance with the next succeeding paragraph) of property or assets or marketable

of the Issuer for the benefit of its employees to the extent funded by the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary, (y) Net Cash Proceeds or property or assets or marketable
securities to the extent that any Restricted Payment has been made from such

for the benefit of its employees to the extent funded by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary) by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary subsequent to the Original Issue
Date of any Indebtedness that has been converted into or exchanged for Capital Stock
of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares) or

value (as determined in accordance with the next succeeding paragraph) of property
or assets or marketable securities, received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
upon such conversion or exchange);

(iv) the amount equal to the net reduction in Restricted Investments made by the Issuer
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries resulting from:

(A) repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions or retirements of any such
Restricted Investment, proceeds realized upon the sale or other disposition to a
Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of any such Restricted
Investment, repayments of loans or advances or other transfers of assets
(including by way of dividend, distribution, interest payments or returns of capital)

Investment in such Subsidiary) or the transfer of all of the assets of such
Unrestricted Subsidiary to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (valued at the
fair market value of the property received by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary),

which amount, in each case under this clause (iv), was included in the calculation of
the amount of Restricted Payments referred to in the first sentence of this clause (c);
_provided, however, that no amount will be included in Consolidated Net Income for_
purposes of the preceding clause (i) to the extent that it is (at the Issuer’s option)
included under this clause (iv); and

(v) the amount of the cash and the fair market value (as determined in accordance with
the next succeeding paragraph) of property or assets or of marketable securities
received by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with:

(A) the sale or other disposition (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
or an employee stock ownership plan or trust established by the Issuer or any
Subsidiary of the Issuer for the benefit of its employees to the extent funded by
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) of Capital Stock of an Unrestricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer; and

(B) any dividend or distribution made by an Unrestricted Subsidiary or Affiliate to the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary;

in each case, which Unrestricted Subsidiary was designated as such after the Original
Issue Date; provided, however, that no amount will be included in Consolidated Net
Income for purposes of the preceding clause (i) to the extent that it is (at the Issuer’s
option) included under this clause (v).

The fair market value of property or assets other than cash covered by the preceding sentence shall be
the fair market value thereof as determined in good faith by an Officer or the Board of Directors of the
Issuer.

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit any of the following (collectively, “Permitted Payments”):

concurrent sale or issuance of, Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock or

stock ownership plan or trust established by the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer for the
benefit of its employees to the extent funded by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, through
the issuance of Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares, through an Excluded
Contribution and to the extent that any Restricted Payment has been made from such proceeds

Stock of such Restricted Subsidiary, that, in each case, is permitted to be Incurred pursuant to
the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” above, and that in each case,
constitutes Refinancing Indebtedness;

(4) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of

on a pro forma basis after giving effect to any such Restricted Payment does not exceed 3.00 to
1.00.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment
meets the criteria of more than one of the categories described in clauses (1) through (17) above, or is
permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer will be entitled to classify such
Restricted Payment (or portion thereof) on the date of its payment or later reclassify such Restricted
Payment (or portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of
such Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The
fair market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of
any non-cash Restricted Payment shall be determined conclusively by an Officer or the Board of
Directors of the Issuer acting in good faith. For purposes hereof, unsecured Indebtedness shall not be
deemed to be subordinate or junior to Indebtedness that is secured by virtue of it not being secured.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur
or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest
therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the
“Initial Lien”), except (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens
if the Notes (or any Note Guarantee in the case of Liens of any Guarantor) are secured equally and
ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the
Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien (in each case, including pursuant to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) for so long as such Indebtedness is
so secured.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes pursuant to clause (2) of the preceding paragraph will be
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and discharge of the Initial
Lien to which it relates.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit
to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any
Restricted Subsidiary to:

213


-----

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock held by
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or pay any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions_
prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of
(including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall
not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the RCF Finance
Documents) or (b) any other agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into

agreement or instrument is assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with
an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in,
or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of
related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was
acquired by the Issuer or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in connection with such transaction) and outstanding
on such date;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument
referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or
contained in any amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in
clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3); provided, however, that the encumbrances
and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or
instrument are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which
such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in good
faith by the Issuer);

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property
or asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer
of any lease, license or other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements not prohibited by

thereto) that impose restrictions on the transfer of the rights, property or assets of the joint venture,

disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements, co-investment and other

of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially
less favorable to the Holders than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Existing
Notes Indentures, the RCF Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, together with the security documents associated therewith as in effect
on the Issue Date after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions or (ii) in comparable financings
(as determined in good faith by the Issuer) and where the Issuer determines when such
Indebtedness is Incurred that such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any
material respect, the Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes;

(12) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any Lien permitted under “—Limitation on
Liens;” or

effect such Qualified Receivables Financing.

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition
unless:

(1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including
by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent
or otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on
the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by an
Officer or the Board of Directors of the Issuer, of the shares and assets subject to such Asset
Disposition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset
Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the
Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset
Disposition (excluding any consideration by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming
responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, other than Indebtedness) received by the

215


-----

Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash, Cash Equivalents
or Temporary Cash Investments; and

(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied by the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be:

(a) to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is
required by the terms of any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary), within 365 days from
the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available
Cash, (i) to prepay, repay or purchase any Indebtedness of a non-Guarantor Restricted
Subsidiary (in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary), Indebtedness secured by a Permitted Lien or Indebtedness under the RCF
Facility Agreement or any other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the second
paragraph of the “—Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant; _provided,_ _however, that, in_
connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to this
clause (a) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will
cause the related commitment (if any) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the
principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased; (ii) to prepay, repay or purchase _Pari_
_Passu Indebtedness at a price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari_
_Passu Indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment,_
repayment or purchase; _provided that the Issuer shall redeem, repay or repurchase_ _Pari_
_Passu Indebtedness that is Public Debt pursuant to this clause (ii) only if the Issuer makes_
(at such time or subsequently in compliance with this covenant) an offer to all Holders to
purchase their Notes at a purchase price equal to or greater than 100% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the date of purchase
and/or redeems Notes pursuant to the redemption provisions set forth above under the
caption “—Optional Redemption,” in each case on a pro rata basis with any such other Pari
_Passu Indebtedness that is purchased; or (iii) to prepay, repay or purchase any_
Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien on the assets or property which were the subject of
the Asset Disposition (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor
or Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary);

(b) to the extent the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, within 365 days from the later
of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash, to
redeem Notes pursuant to the redemption provisions set forth above under the caption “—
Optional Redemption” and/or (at the option of the Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary) purchase
Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders at a purchase price equal to at least 100% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest;

(c) to the extent the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit to invest
in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a
Restricted Subsidiary with Net Available Cash received by the Issuer or another Restricted
Subsidiary) within 365 days from the later of (i) the date of such Asset Disposition and (ii)
the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that any such reinvestment in
Additional Assets made pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or a commitment
approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer that is executed or approved within such
time will satisfy this requirement, so long as such investment is consummated within 180
days of such 365th day; or

(d) any combination of the foregoing,

_provided that, pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with clause_
(a), (b), (c) or (d) above, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness
or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

Except as set forth in the second succeeding paragraph, for purposes of determining compliance with
the provisions of this covenant, the euro equivalent of any Indebtedness denominated in another
currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
Indebtedness was Incurred.

216


-----

Any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to be
applied or invested as provided in the first paragraph of this covenant will be deemed to constitute
“Excess Proceeds” under the Indenture. On the 366th day (or the 546th day, in the case of any Net
Available Cash committed to be used pursuant to any definitive binding agreement or commitment
approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer pursuant to clause (c) of the first paragraph of this
covenant) after the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net
Available Cash, or at such earlier date that the Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess
Proceeds under the Indenture exceeds €90 million, the Issuer will be required to make an offer (“Asset
_Disposition Offer”) to all Holders of Notes issued under the Indenture and, to the extent the Issuer elects,_
to all holders of other outstanding _Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum aggregate_
principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer
applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in
an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and, in the case of any _Pari Passu_
Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such _Pari Passu_
Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of
purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing
such _Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in_
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary may make an Asset Disposition Offer prior to the expiration of the 366-day or 546-day period,
as applicable, referred to above.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and
not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the
Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other
covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in
any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or
lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated
among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so tendered. For the purposes
of calculating the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in euro, such
Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such aggregate principal amounts into their euro
equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer
Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess
Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in
a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated, the amount thereof
payable in respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such
Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion into such
currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less
than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later
than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset
_Disposition Purchase Date”), the Issuer will purchase the aggregate principal amount of Notes and, to_
the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased pursuant to this covenant (the
“Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly
tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition
Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for
payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and
_Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered_
and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition
Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and _Pari Passu_
Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations of
€100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer
in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Issuer or the relevant Paying Agent, as the case
may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset
Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price

217


-----

of the Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer
for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the Global Note), and the Trustee
or the Registrar, as applicable, upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate
and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) such new Note to such Holder, in an
aggregate principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered; provided that
each such new Note will be in an aggregate principal amount with a minimum denomination of
€100,000. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry)
by the Issuer to the Holder thereof.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to
be cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness of the Issuer or Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor) and the release
of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness in connection
with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer from the transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash
or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of
such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are
released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset
Disposition; provided that such Indebtedness is not, directly or indirectly, secured by any Lien on
any of the assets or property of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (including Capital Stock
of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer);

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer (other than Subordinated Indebtedness)
received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in
such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other
Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time
outstanding, not to exceed the greater of €90 million and 1.5% of Total Assets (with the fair market
value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received
and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value); and

(6) any Capital Stock or assets of a kind referred to in clause (3)(c) of the first paragraph of this
covenant.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of any applicable securities laws
or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which the Notes are then listed) in connection with the
repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws
or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with
the applicable securities laws and regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have
breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of any conflict.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter
into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or
exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the
Issuer (any such transaction or series of related transactions, “Affiliate Transaction”) involving
aggregate value in excess of €30 million unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a
comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing
for such transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

218


-----

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of €75 million, the
terms of such transaction have been approved by a majority of the members of the Board of
Directors of the Issuer.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (2) of
this paragraph if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—
_Limitation on Restricted Payments,” any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to clause (9)(ii)_
of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”) or
any Permitted Investment (other than Permitted Investments as defined in paragraphs (1)(b), (2)
and (14) of the definition thereof);

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities,
or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding
of, or entering into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and
other compensation arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of
the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive
plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or
consultants’ plans (including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance,
retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf
of officers, employees, directors or consultants approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer,
in each case in the ordinary course of business;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) any transaction between or among the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted
Subsidiaries;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities
(including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses
provided on behalf of, directors, officers, consultants or employees of the Issuer, any Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer or any Parent (whether directly or indirectly and including through any
Person owned or controlled by any of such directors, officers or employees);

(6) the Transactions and the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction pursuant to or contemplated by, and
any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of
or on the Issue Date after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions as these agreements and
instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed or refinanced from
time to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more
disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect and the entry into and performance of any
registration rights or other listing agreement in connection with any Public Offering;

(7) execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or the formation and
maintenance of any consolidated group for tax, accounting or cash pooling or management
purposes in the ordinary course of business;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in
each case, in the ordinary course of business which are fair to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted
Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or the Senior Management
of the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable than those
that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Issuer or an Associate, similar entity or Co-Investment Vehicle
that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary

219


-----

owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate, similar entity or
Co-Investment Vehicle;

(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference
Shares) of the Issuer or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock or
Subordinated Shareholder Funding; provided that the interest rate and other financial terms of
such Subordinated Shareholder Funding are approved by a majority of the members of the Board
of Directors of the Issuer in their reasonable determination and (b) any amendment, waiver or
other transaction with respect to any Subordinated Shareholder Funding in compliance with the
other provisions of the Indenture;

Permitted Holder in connection with its direct or indirect investment in the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries;

(12) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Receivables Financing;

(13) the performance of any transactions or obligations of any Person or any of its Subsidiaries under
the terms of any transaction arising out of, or payments made pursuant to or for the purposes of
funding, any agreement or instrument in effect at the time such Person is acquired by the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary, including by way of a merger, amalgamation or consolidation with
or into the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in a transaction that is not prohibited by the
Indenture; provided that such agreements or instruments were not made in contemplation of such
acquisition, merger, amalgamation or consolidation and were in existence on, or made pursuant
to binding commitments existing on, the date of such acquisition, merger, amalgamation or
consolidation; and

(14) transactions in which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, delivers to the
Trustee a letter or opinion from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that (i) the terms are not
materially less favorable to the Issuer or its relevant Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be,
than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arm’s length basis or (ii) that the transaction
is fair to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view.

**_Reports_**

For so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will provide to the Trustee the following reports:

(1) within 120 days after the end of the Issuer’s fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2019, annual reports containing, to the extent applicable, the following information:
(a) audited consolidated balance sheets of the Issuer as of the end of the most recent fiscal year
and audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Issuer for the
most recent fiscal year (in each case, with comparable prior-year periods), including footnotes to
such financial statements and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements;
(b) unaudited pro forma income statement information and balance sheet information of the Issuer
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the provision of a full income statement or
balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available), together with explanatory footnotes, for any
material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of
the most recently completed fiscal year (unless such pro forma information has been provided in
a previous report pursuant to clause (2) or (3) below); (c) an operating and financial review of the
audited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial
condition, EBITDA and liquidity and capital resources of the Issuer, and a discussion of material
commitments and contingencies and critical accounting policies; (d) a description of the business,
management and shareholders of the Issuer, all material affiliate transactions and a description
of all material contractual arrangements and (e) material risk factors in a level of detail comparable
to the English language version of the Issuer’s annual report for the year ended December 31,
2018 and material recent developments (to the extent not previously reported pursuant to clauses
(2) and (3) below);

(2) within 60 days following the end of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Issuer
beginning with the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2019, all quarterly reports of the Issuer

220


-----

containing the following information: (a) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as
of the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the
most recent quarter ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and the comparable
prior year periods, together with condensed footnote disclosure; (b) unaudited pro forma income
statement information and balance sheet information of the Issuer (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall not include the provision of a full income statement or balance sheet to the extent not
reasonably available), together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions,
dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently
completed fiscal year; (c) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements,
including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, EBITDA and material
changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Issuer and a discussion of material changes not
in the ordinary course of business in commitments and contingencies since the most recent report;
and (d) material recent developments (to the extent not previously reported pursuant to clause (3)
below); and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring or any senior
executive officer changes or change in auditors of the Issuer, or any other material event that the
Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries announces publicly, a report containing a description
of such event.

All financial statement and pro forma financial information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS
as in effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then
in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods presented; provided, however, that the reports set
forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in applicable IFRS, present earlier
periods on a basis that applied to such periods. The filing of an Annual Report on Form 20-F within the
time period specified in (1) will satisfy such provision.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, constitutes a
Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the annual and quarterly financial information required by
clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant shall include either (i) a reasonably detailed
presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial
condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries other than any Unrestricted
Subsidiary (as applicable) separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the
Unrestricted Subsidiaries of Issuer or (ii) stand-alone audited or unaudited financial statements, as the
case may be, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as a group or otherwise)
together with an unaudited reconciliation to the financial information of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries
other than any Unrestricted Subsidiary (as applicable), which reconciliation shall include the following
items: net revenues, EBITDA, ERC, net income, cash, total assets, total debt and interest expense.

Substantially concurrently with the issuance to the Trustee of the reports specified in clauses (1), (2)
and (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer shall also (a) use its commercially reasonable
efforts (i) to post copies of such reports on such website as may be then maintained by the Issuer and
its Subsidiaries or (ii) otherwise to provide substantially comparable availability of such reports (as
determined by the Issuer in good faith) or (b) to the extent the Issuer determines in good faith that it
cannot make such reports available in the manner described in the preceding clause (a) owing to
applicable law or after the use of its commercially reasonable efforts, furnish such reports to the Holders
and, upon request, prospective purchasers of the Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
the Issuer either (i) posts copies of such reports on such website as may be then maintained by the
Issuer and its Subsidiaries or (ii) otherwise provides substantially comparable availability of such reports
(as determined by the Issuer in good faith), it will be deemed to have delivered such information by
making it available to the Trustee.

In addition, so long as the Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the Parent is
not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b),
the Parent shall furnish to the Holders and, upon their request, prospective purchasers of the Notes,
the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially
all its assets, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to, any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Issuer”) will be a Person organized
and existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union, the United Kingdom, the
United States of America, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia, Canada or
any province of Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Issuer (if not the Issuer) will
expressly assume (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the
Indenture and (b) all obligations of the Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement or such Additional
Intercreditor Agreement (to the extent required by the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement);

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes
an obligation of the Successor Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Successor Issuer as a result of
such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Issuer or such Subsidiary at the time
of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Successor Issuer would be able
to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Consolidated Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio of the Successor Issuer would not be less than the Consolidated Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel,
each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if
any) comply with the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental
indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and
binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Issuer (in each case, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee); provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel
may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact, including as to satisfaction of clauses
(2) and (3) above.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition
of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which
properties and assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to
be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer.

The Successor Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power
of, the Issuer under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the
predecessor Issuer will not be released from its obligations under such Indenture or the Notes.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this
sentence) and, other than with respect to the second preceding paragraph, clause (4) of the first
paragraph of this covenant, (a) any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer may consolidate or otherwise
combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer and (b) the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may undertake a Permitted Reorganization.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (3) and (4) (which do not apply to the transactions referred to in
this sentence), the Issuer may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or a
portion of its assets to an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal
domicile of the Issuer, reincorporating the Issuer in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of
the Issuer.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

222


-----

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this
covenant) will not apply to the creation of a new subsidiary of the Issuer that becomes a parent of one
or more of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If, on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on
that day (the “Suspension Date”) and continuing until the Reversion Date, the provisions of the
Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to such Notes: “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments,” “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions_
_from Restricted Subsidiaries,” “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions,” “—Limitation on Sales of Assets_
_and Subsidiary Stock,” “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries; Future_
_Guarantors” and the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—_
_Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer,” and, in each case, any related default provision of the_
Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries. Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their
terms from the first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not,
however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Issuer properly taken during the continuance of
the Suspension Event, and the “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if
it has been in effect since the date of such Indenture except that no Default will be deemed to have
occurred solely by reason of a Restricted Payment made while that covenant was suspended. On the
Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be
classified, at the Issuer’s option, as having been Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or one of the clauses set forth in the second paragraph
of such covenant (to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be Incurred thereunder as of
the Reversion Date and after giving effect to Indebtedness Incurred prior to the Suspension Event and
outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the extent such Indebtedness would not be so permitted to be
incurred under the first two paragraphs of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,”
such Indebtedness will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified
as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Indebtedness.”_

The Issuer shall notify the Trustee and the Holders that the two conditions set forth in the first paragraph
under this heading have been satisfied; provided that such notification shall not be a condition for the
suspension of the covenants set forth above to be effective. The Trustee shall not be obliged to notify
Holders of such event.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an investment grade rating.

**_Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries; Future Guarantors_**

The Issuer will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, directly or
indirectly, to Guarantee any Public Debt or any refinancing thereof in whole or in part unless such
Restricted Subsidiary becomes a Guarantor on the date on which such other Guarantee or other
Indebtedness, as applicable, is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a
supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted
Subsidiary will provide a Guarantee of the Notes, which Note Guarantee will be senior to or pari passu
with such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such other Indebtedness.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event that on any date the MTNs and any Eligible MTN
Replacement Indebtedness that contains a covenant substantially similar to the MTN Negative Pledge
Provision have been repaid in full, the Issuer will procure that the Restricted Subsidiaries which
Guarantee any Indebtedness under the RCF Facility Agreement will each, within 60 days of such date,
become a Guarantor and, if applicable, execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in
the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Note
Guarantee, which Note Guarantee will be senior to or _pari passu with such Restricted Subsidiary’s_
Guarantee of the RCF Facility Agreement.

223


-----

A Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor may become a Guarantor if it executes and delivers to
the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such
Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Guarantee of the Notes.

Each Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to
guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference,
financial assistance, corporate purpose, thin capitalization, distributable reserves, capital maintenance
or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations
under applicable law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer shall not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary to
Guarantee the Notes to the extent and for so long as such Restricted Subsidiary is an Excluded
Subsidiary or the Incurrence of such Guarantee is not required to be granted by operation of the Agreed
Security Principles or could reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in: (1) any violation of
applicable law or regulation; (2) any liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case
of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such
partnership); (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other
than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and other than reasonable expenses incurred in connection
with any governmental or regulatory filings required as a result of, or any measures pursuant to clause
(1) of this paragraph undertaken in connection with, such Guarantee, which in any case under any of
clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this paragraph cannot be avoided through measures reasonably available to
the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; or (4) an inconsistency with the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will automatically and unconditionally terminate and release (and
thereupon will terminate and discharge and be of no further force and effect):

- upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of ownership interests
in the Guarantor (directly or through a parent company) such that the Guarantor does not remain a
Restricted Subsidiary, or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor
(other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each case, otherwise permitted by the
Indenture;

- upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary;

- upon the defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction
_and Discharge;”_

- in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

- in the case of any Restricted Subsidiary that after the Issue Date is required to Guarantee the Notes
pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, upon the release or discharge of the Guarantee of
Indebtedness by such Restricted Subsidiary that resulted in the obligation to Guarantee the Notes;
_provided that no Event of Default would arise as a result and such Restricted Subsidiary does not_
Guarantee any other Public Debt of the Issuer or any Guarantor;

- in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization; or

- as described under “—Amendments and Waivers.”

**Maintenance of Listing**

The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes
on the Securities Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange for so long as such Notes are
outstanding; provided that if the Issuer is unable to obtain admission to such listing or if at any time the
Issuer determines that it will not maintain such listing, it will use its commercially reasonable efforts
(where the Notes are initially so listed, prior to the delisting of the Notes from the Securities Official List
of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange) to obtain and thereafter to maintain a listing of the Notes on

224


-----

another stock exchange deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors or a member of Senior
Management.

**_Payments for Consent_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, pay or
cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any Holder for or as an inducement to any
consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms of the provisions of the Indenture or the Notes unless
such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all Holders that consent, waive or agree to amend
in the time frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be permitted, in any offer
or payment of consideration for, or as an inducement to, any consent, waiver or amendment of any of
the terms or provisions of the Indenture, to exclude Holders in any jurisdiction or any category of Holders
where (1) the solicitation of such consent, waiver or amendment, including in connection with any tender
or exchange offer, or (2) the payment of the consideration therefor could reasonably be interpreted as
requiring the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to file a registration statement, prospectus or
similar document under any applicable securities laws or listing requirements (including, but not limited
to, the United States federal securities laws, the laws of the United Kingdom and the laws of the
European Union or any of its member states), which the Issuer in its sole discretion determines (acting
in good faith) (a) would be materially burdensome (it being understood that it would not be materially
burdensome to file the consent document(s) used in other jurisdictions, any substantially similar
documents or any summary thereof with the securities or financial services authorities in such
jurisdiction); or (b) such solicitation would otherwise not be permitted under applicable law in such
jurisdiction or with respect to such category of Holders.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note when due and
payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under
the Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required
repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure to comply with the provisions of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Merger and Consolidation;”_

(4) failure to comply for 30 days after written notice by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the
Holders of 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes with any of the Issuer’s
obligations under the covenants described under “—Change of Control” above (other than a
failure to purchase Notes which will constitute an Event of Default under clause (2) above);

(5) failure by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after written notice
by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of 30% in aggregate principal amount
of the outstanding Notes with its other agreements contained in the Indenture;

(6) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which
there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries) other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after September 10, 2019,
which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately
upon the expiration of any grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”);
or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross acceleration
_provision”)_

225


-----

and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the
aggregate principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a
payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates €55 million or
more;

(7) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer or a Significant
Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited
consolidated financial statements of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute
a Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(8) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, to pay final judgments aggregating in
excess of €55 million (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has
acknowledged liability for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60
days after the judgment becomes final (the “judgment default provision”); and

(9) any Note Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary or a group of Guarantors that when taken together
(as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year), would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary, ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such
Note Guarantee or the Indenture) or is declared invalid or unenforceable in a judicial proceeding
or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Note Guarantee and any
such Default continues for 10 days (the “guarantee provisions”).

However, a default under clauses (4), (5), (6) or (8) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of
Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes notify the Issuer of the default and, with respect to clauses (4), (5), (6) or (8), the Issuer does not
cure such default within the time specified in clauses (4), (5), (6) or (8), as applicable, of this paragraph
after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (7) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee
at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid
interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a
declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if
any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes
because an Event of Default described in clause (6) under “—Events of Default” has occurred and is
continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of
default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (6) shall have been
remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to
such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of
acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not
conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of
Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on
the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (7) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium,
if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Notes will
become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the
Trustee or any Holders.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture
may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of
principal, premium or interest, or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with
respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree
of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers
under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered

226


-----

to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense.
Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue
any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested
in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing the Trustee indemnity and/or security against any loss,
liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written
request and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given
the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request
within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any
remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The
Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of which a
responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise
of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs.
The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that
the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the
Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled
to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to it against all losses and expenses caused by taking or
not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and a responsible officer of the
Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the
Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment
of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so
long as a committee of trust officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in
the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the
end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any
Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within
30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would
constitute a Default, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect
thereof.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such
Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will
also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply
with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice
or certificate pursuant to any other provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the
delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though
such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Notes provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but
only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee
to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will
be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to
take action directly.

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture.

227


-----

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Note Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange
offer for, such Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions
thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender
offer or exchange offer for, such Notes). If any amendment, supplement or waiver will only affect one
series of Notes, only the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Notes of that affected series (and not the consent of the holders of the majority of all Notes) shall be
required. However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% of the then-outstanding
aggregate principal amount of Notes affected (provided that if any amendment, supplement or waiver
will only affect one series of the Notes, then only the consent of the holders of at least 90% of the
aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of that affected series (and not the consent
of the holders of at least 90% of all Notes) shall be required), an amendment or waiver may not, with
respect to any such Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note;

(3) reduce the principal of, or extend the Stated Maturity of, any such Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which
any such Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “—Optional
_Redemption;”_

(5) make any such Note payable in money other than that stated in such Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal,
interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes on or after the
due date therefor;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes” that
adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the
terms of such Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes
described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so
described thereunder unless the Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect
thereof;

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or
interest or Additional Amounts, if any (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes
by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of
the payment default that resulted from such acceleration); or

(9) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent
described in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee and the other
parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Note Document to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency, conform any provision to this
“Description of the Notes,” or reduce the minimum denomination of the Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor
under any Note Document;

(3) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided that the
uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code);

228


-----

(4) add to the covenants or provide for a Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any
right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect;

(6) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) for the issuance
of Additional Notes in accordance with the Indenture;

(7) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries; Future_
_Guarantors,” to add Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add Collateral for the benefit of the_
Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Guarantee
or Lien with respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking
is provided for under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement; or

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Note Documents of a
successor Trustee and pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by
the Trustee to any Note Document.

The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on such evidence as it deems appropriate including Officer’s
Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of
the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder
given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required aggregate principal amount of the Notes have
concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, any Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly
or indirectly controlling, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer will
be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all its and any Guarantor’s obligations under the Notes and the
Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for
certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties,
immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and
obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes, registrations of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or
stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments
held in trust.

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and any Guarantors’ obligations under the covenants described
under “—Certain Covenants” (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”) and “—Change of Control” and
the default provisions relating to such covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the
operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy
provisions with respect to the Issuer and its Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the
guarantee provisions and the security default provisions described under “—Events of Default” above
(“covenant defeasance”).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment
of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. If the
Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may
not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to
clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and

229


-----

_Consolidation—The Issuer”), (4), (5), (6), (7) (other than with respect to the Issuer), (8) or (9) under “—_
_Events of Default” above._

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
“defeasance trust”) with the Trustee (or such entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee
for this purpose) cash in euros or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a
combination thereof for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to
redemption or maturity, as the case may be; provided that, if requested by the Issuer, the Trustee will
distribute any amounts deposited in trust to the Holders prior to the Stated Maturity or redemption date,
as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders will not recognize income,
gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and
will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the
same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and
in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based
on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income
tax law since the issuance of the Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for
or relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied
with;

(4) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or
is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940;
and

(5) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee all other documents or other information that the Trustee may
reasonably require in connection with either defeasance option.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of
conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all
outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than
certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes and certain Notes for which provision for payment was previously
made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Trustee
for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become
due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to
be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving
of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer
has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or such entity designated or appointed (as
agent) by the Trustee for this purpose), euros or euro-denominated European Government Obligations
or a combination thereof, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the
Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest
to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity
or redemption date, as the case may be; _provided that, if requested by the Issuer, the Trustee will_
distribute any amounts deposited in trust to the Holders prior to the Stated Maturity or redemption date,
as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the
Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions under the Indenture to apply the
deposited money towards payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may
be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel
each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the “—Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the
Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with; provided
that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to
compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4)). If requested by the Issuer in writing no later
than two Business Days prior to such distribution to the Trustee and Principal Paying Agent (which

230


-----

request may be included in the applicable notice of redemption pursuant to the above referenced
Officer’s Certificate) the Trustee shall distribute any amount deposited to the Holders prior to the Stated
Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be; provided that the Notes shall be marked down on
the date of early repayment and such early repayment will not occur prior to the record date set for
redemption. For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to the Holders prior to the maturity
or redemption date as set forth above shall not include any negative interest, present value adjustment,
break cost or any additional premium on such amounts. To the extent the Notes are represented by a
Global Note deposited with a depositary for the clearing system, any payment to the beneficial holders
holding interests as a participant of such clearing system shall be subject to the then applicable
procedures of the clearing system.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer under the Note Documents
or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder
by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the
consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the
U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

Citibank, N.A., London Branch will be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will
provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the
Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically
in such Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will exercise such of the
rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent
Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain
from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and
Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced.
Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders
of a majority in principal amount of the then-outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving
written notice to the Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest
that is not eliminated or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt,
then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less
than 6 months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor
Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of
appointment by the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification and security of the Trustee by the Issuer
for any loss, liability and expenses incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its
part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

For so long as any of the Notes are listed on the Securities Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, notices with respect to the
Notes will be published in a leading newspaper having general circulation in Luxembourg (which is
expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, such
[notices will be posted on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu). In](http://www.bourse.lu/)
addition, for so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders will be
delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer in accordance with the rules and procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable, in lieu of the aforesaid mailing.

231


-----

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published
more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices
are mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the
seventh day after being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to
such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder
if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any
defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is
mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the
Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against
the Issuer for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed three years after the applicable
due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and any
Guarantors under or in connection with the Notes and any Note Guarantees, as the case may be,
including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than euro, whether as a
result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or
dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any
sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge of the
obligations of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the euro amount which the
recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the
date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first
date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee
under any Note, the Issuer and any Guarantor will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such
recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and any Guarantor will indemnify the
recipient or the Trustee on a joint or several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For
the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated
therein for the Holder or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer
(indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These
indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and any Guarantor’s
other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of
any waiver granted by any Holder or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein)
and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated
amount in respect of any sum due under any Note, any Note Guarantee or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any
euro-denominated restriction herein, the euro equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is
denominated in a non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate
in effect on the date such non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all the assets of the Issuer are held outside the United States, and any judgment
obtained in the United States against the Issuer, including judgments with respect to the payment of
principal, premium, if any, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any
purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectable within the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the
Notes and any Note Guarantees, the Issuer will in the Indenture, and any Guarantor will in any
Supplemental Indenture, irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the
Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New York, United States.

232


-----

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes, including any Note Guarantees, and the rights and duties of the parties
thereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
The Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements will be governed by the laws
of England and Wales.

“—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation” and not by the provisions described under the
caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock;” provided further
that the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the economic benefit of a portfolio of loans or
receivables (or any specified portion thereof) pursuant to a derivative instrument or otherwise will,
subject to the next succeeding sentence, constitute an Asset Disposition of the underlying portfolio
assets (or specified percentage thereof) for all purposes of the Indenture (a “Synthetic Sale”).

adjustment pursuant to clause (1) or (2) above if made by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
since the beginning of such period, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Interest Expense for
such period will be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such Sale or Purchase
occurred on the first day of such period;

(4) if the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary has incurred any Indebtedness since the beginning of
such period that remains outstanding or if the transaction giving rise to the need to calculate the
Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is an incurrence of Indebtedness or both,
Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Interest Expense for such period shall be calculated after
giving effect on a pro forma basis to such Indebtedness as if such Indebtedness had been incurred
on the first day of such period and the discharge of any other Indebtedness repaid, repurchased,
defeased or otherwise discharged with the proceeds of such new Indebtedness as if such
discharge had occurred on the first day of such period; provided, however, that, other than for the
purposes of the calculation of the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio under clause (5) of
the second paragraph under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the
pro forma calculation of the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall not give effect to (a)

applicable period.

For the purposes of this definition and the definitions of Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Income
Taxes, Consolidated Interest Expense and Consolidated Net Income, calculations will be as determined
in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer of the Issuer (including, to the extent
applicable, in respect of cost savings and cost reduction synergies).

If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest, the interest expense on such Indebtedness shall

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

Each series of the Notes sold to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A will initially be represented by one or
more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (a “Rule 144A Global Note”).
Each series of the Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S will initially be
represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (a
“Regulation S Global Note” and, together with the Rule 144A Global Note, the “Global Notes”). The
Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depositary and registered in the
name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Regulation S prohibits initial purchasers of the Notes under Regulation S from offering, selling or
delivering the Notes within the United States or to or for the account or benefit of U.S. persons for the
period through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of the Offering and the
closing of the Offering (the “Distribution Compliance Period”). Beneficial interests in the Rule 144A
Global Notes may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Notes at any
time except in the circumstances described below. See “—Transfers.” In addition, transfers of beneficial
interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, which may change from time to time.

Ownership of interests in a Rule 144A Global Note (the “Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and
ownership of interests in a Regulation S Global Note, as applicable (the “Regulation S Book-Entry
**Interests” and, together with the Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”), will be**
limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons that hold interests
through such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold Book-Entry Interests on behalf of their
participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their
respective depositaries. Except under the limited circumstances described below, Book-Entry Interests
will not be issued in definitive form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records
maintained by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The Book-Entry Interests in Global
Notes will be issued only in denominations of at least €100,000, and will be in integral multiples of
€1,000. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that
certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. The
foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition,
while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or
“holders” of Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream (or
its nominee), as applicable, will be considered the sole holder of the Global Notes for all purposes under
the Indenture. In addition, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and
indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and the participants
through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of
holders of Notes under the Indenture.

Neither the Issuer, the Principal Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor the Trustee will
have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the
amount received by them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price
payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount
received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global
Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that, under the existing practices of Euroclear
and Clearstream, if fewer than all of their Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and
Clearstream will credit their participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent
fractions), by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate (including pool factor);
_provided that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount, may be redeemed in part._

268


-----

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, interest and additional amounts, if any) to the Principal Paying Agent for onward
payment to Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will distribute such payments to
participants in accordance with their customary procedures. The Issuer will make payments of all such
amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties,
assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as
described under “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes.” If any such deduction or withholding is
required to be made, then, to the extent described under “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes,”
the Issuer will pay additional amounts as may be necessary for the net amounts received by any holder
of the Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding to equal the
net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note
or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. The Issuer expects
that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to
owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Principal Paying Agent, the Transfer
Agent, the Registrar or any of their respective agents will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes
(i.e., the common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream (or its nominee)) as the owner thereof for the
purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the
Trustee, the Principal Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or any of their respective agents
has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

- any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating
to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or
reviewing the records of Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating
to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

- Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or

- the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants.

**Currency of payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of the Notes
will be paid to holders of Book-Entry Interests through Euroclear or Clearstream in euro.

**Action by owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a
holder of a Book-Entry Interest only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the
Book-Entry Interests are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount
of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and
Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any
other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the Notes,
Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the holders of Book-Entry Interests, reserve the right to
exchange the Global Notes for definitive registered notes in certificated form (the “Definitive
**Registered Notes”) and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their participants.**

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with
Euroclear and Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of
Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for
any reason, including to sell Book-Entry Interests to persons in states that require physical delivery of
such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of Book-Entry Interests must transfer its

269


-----

Book-Entry Interests in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth under “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry
Interests will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed under
“Notice to Investors.”

Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the
form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in compliance with
Regulation S or in accordance with Rule 144A or any other exemption (if available under the U.S.
Securities Act).

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor
reasonably believes is a QIB in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in
accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with
any applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule
144A Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal
amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the
Rule 144A Global Note and vice versa with respect to transfers involving an exchange of a Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interest for a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests only as
described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange,” if required, only if the transferor
first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that
such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See
“Transfer Restrictions.”

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in
the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry
Interest in the first-mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note,
and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures
applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry
Interest.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered
Notes:

(1) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as
depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days; or

(2) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through
Euroclear or Clearstream following an event of default under the Indenture and enforcement
action is being taken in respect thereof under the Indenture.

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry
Interest described in the immediately preceding clause (2), their current procedure is to request that the
Issuer issue, or cause to be issued, Definitive Registered Notes to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names
and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream or the
Issuer, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon
directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and

270


-----

such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless
that legend is not required by such Indenture or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, each of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Principal Paying Agent, the Transfer
Agent and the Registrar shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Definitive Registered Note
as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such.

Ownership of the Definitive Registered Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time
at the registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

**Information concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
as applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the
convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of the settlement system are controlled by
the settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither the Issuer nor any of the Initial
Purchasers is responsible for those operations or procedures.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and
Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement
of securities transactions between their participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts
of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including
the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded
securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and
Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers,
banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream
is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or
maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or
indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can act only on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such
interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream system, or
otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate
for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of
securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons
may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems
will receive distributions attributable to the Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream
participants.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry
Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in
Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Global clearance and settlement under the book-entry system**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Securities Official List of
the Exchange. Transfers of Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear
or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules
and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under
no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be
discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer
Agent, the Registrar or the Principal Paying Agent will have any responsibility for the performance by
Euroclear, Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective
obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

271


-----

**Initial settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in
registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear
and Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value
of the settlement date.

**Secondary market trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear and Clearstream and will settle in
same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the
time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are
located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**Certain United States federal income tax considerations**

The following is a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations related to the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential
tax effects. This discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. holder (as defined below),
except for the discussion of Additional Notes and of FATCA (as defined under “—Foreign Account Tax
Compliance Act”), and does not address the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal
income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. This
discussion is based upon the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury
regulations issued thereunder (the “Treasury Regulations”), and judicial and administrative
interpretations thereof, each as in effect on September 10, 2019, and all of which are subject to
change, possibly with retroactive effect. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”)
have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no
assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the
purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or that any such position would not be sustained.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant
to a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the unearned
income Medicare contribution tax or the alternative minimum tax, or to holders subject to special rules,
such as certain financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, dealers in securities or
currencies, traders in securities, U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar,
tax-exempt entities, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or
other pass through entities and investors in such entities, persons that are tendering any notes in the
Redemption, persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income
with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an “applicable financial statement” (as defined in
Section 451 of the Code), U.S. holders that are resident in or have a permanent establishment in a
jurisdiction outside the United States, U.S. holders that hold Notes through non-U.S. brokers or other
non-U.S. intermediaries and persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion
transaction” or other integrated transaction. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who
purchase Notes for cash pursuant to this Offering at their “issue price” (the first price at which a
substantial amount of Notes is sold to the public for cash, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or
similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or
wholesalers) and who hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation
or any entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in or
under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) any estate the
income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) any trust if a
court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust
and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a
valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person.

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the
Notes, the U.S. tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of
the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partnership considering an investment in the Notes,
and partners in such a partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income
tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.

**_Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax_**
**_consequences of holding Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the_**
**_application of the U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed below, as well as the_**
**_application of other federal, state, local, foreign or other tax laws._**

**_Potential contingent payment debt treatment_**

The contingent obligation to pay additional amounts or redeem the notes early may implicate the
provisions of the Treasury Regulations relating to “contingent payment debt instruments.” We intend to
take the position that the forgoing contingencies will not cause the notes to be treated as contingent

273


-----

payment debt instruments. Our position is uncertain and is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS
successfully takes a contrary position, U.S. holders would generally be required to treat any gain
recognized on the sale or other disposition of the notes as ordinary income rather than as capital gain.
Furthermore, U.S. holders would be required to accrue interest income on a constant yield determined
at the time of issuance of the notes, with adjustments to such accruals when any contingent payments
are made that differ from the payments calculated based on the assumed yield. U.S. holders should
consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the notes being treated as contingent
payment debt instruments. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the notes are not treated as
contingent payment debt instruments.

**_Payments and accruals of stated interest_**

Stated interest on the Notes (including any additional amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes and
without reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be includible in the gross income of a U.S.
holder as ordinary income at the time that such payments are received or accrued, in accordance with
such U.S. holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that
receives a payment of stated interest on the Notes will be required to include in income (as ordinary
income) the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency interest payment (determined based on the spot
rate of exchange on the date such payment is received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact
converted to U.S. dollars at such time. A cash method U.S. holder will not recognize foreign currency
exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such stated interest, but may recognize foreign
currency exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the foreign currency so received.

A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or who
is otherwise required to accrue interest prior to receipt, will be required to include in income (as ordinary
income) the U.S. dollar value of the amount of stated interest income in foreign currency that has
accrued for such year determined by translating such amount into U.S. dollars at the average spot rate
of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years,
at the average spot rate of exchange for the partial period within each taxable year. Alternatively, an
accrual basis U.S. holder may make an election (which must be applied consistently to all debt
instruments held by the electing U.S. holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the
election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. holder, and cannot be changed without the consent
of the IRS) to translate accrued interest income into U.S. dollars using the spot rate of exchange on the
last day of the interest accrual period (or the last day of the taxable year in the case of a partial accrual
period), or at the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt, if that date is within five business days of
the last day of the accrual period. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S.
federal income tax purposes will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to
accrued stated interest income on the date such interest is received. The amount of foreign currency
exchange gain or loss recognized will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the
foreign currency payment received (determined based on the spot rate of exchange on the date such
stated interest is received) in respect of such accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of the interest
income that has accrued during such accrual period (as determined above), regardless of whether the
payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time. Any such foreign currency exchange gain or
loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated, for foreign tax credit purposes, as
U.S. source income or loss, and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or
expense.

**_Original issue discount_**

The Notes may be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such event, U.S. holders
generally will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) for U.S. federal
income tax purposes on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their
regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. holders will
generally include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income.

The Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds their
issue price (as defined above) by an amount equal to or greater than a statutorily defined de minimis
amount (generally, 0.0025 multiplied by the stated principal amount and the number of complete years
to maturity from the issue date).

274


-----

In the event that the Notes are issued with OID, the amount of OID with respect to a Note includible in
income by a U.S. holder is the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the Note for each day
during the taxable year or portion thereof in which such U.S. holder holds such Note. A daily portion is
determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued
in such period. The accrual period of a Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term
of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment
of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that
accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the Note’s “adjusted issue
price” at the beginning of such accrual period and its “yield to maturity,” determined on the basis of
compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period,
over (ii) the amount of stated interest allocable to such accrual period. For purposes of determining OID
accruals and adjusted issue price only, the amounts of stated interest and OID are determined by
assuming that the interest rate on the Notes is a fixed rate based on the value of the floating rate
applicable to the Notes as of the issue date. The adjusted issue price of a Note at the start of any
accrual period is equal to its issue price, increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period
and decreased by the amount of any payments previously made on the Notes that were not stated
interest payments. The yield to maturity of a Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the
present value of all principal and interest payments to be made under the Note, produces an amount
equal to the issue price of the Note.

OID, if any, on the Notes will be determined for any accrual period in foreign currency and then
translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described above in
the third paragraph under “—Payments and accruals of stated interest.”

A U.S. holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon
the disposition of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously
included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the foreign
currency payment received, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is
received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above.
For these purposes, all receipts on a Note will be viewed first, as payment of stated interest payable on
the Note; second, as receipt of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments
considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and third, as receipt of principal. The rules
governing OID instruments are complex and prospective purchasers should consult their own tax
advisors concerning the application of such rules to the Notes as well as the interplay between the
application of the OID rules and the currency exchange gain or loss rules.

**_Sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder
generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized upon
such disposition (less any amount equal to any accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable
as interest income in accordance with the U.S. holder’s method of tax accounting as described above
to the extent not previously included in income by the U.S. holder) and such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax
basis in the Note.

A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will, in general, be the cost of such Note to such U.S. holder,
decreased by payments on the Note other than stated interest and increased by any OID previously
accrued by such U.S. holder with respect to such Note. The cost of a Note purchased with foreign
currency will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price on the date of
purchase, calculated at the exchange rate in effect on that date. If the Note is traded on an established
securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and, if it elects, an accrual basis taxpayer) will determine the
U.S. dollar value of the cost of the Note by translating the amount paid at the spot rate of exchange on
the settlement date of the purchase.

If a U.S. holder receives foreign currency on such a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other
taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of
such foreign currency translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of taxable disposition. In the
case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S.
holder (and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder) will determine the U.S. dollar value of such
foreign currency by translating such amount at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the
disposition. The special election available to accrual basis U.S. holders in regard to the purchase and

275


-----

disposition of Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt
instruments held by the U.S. holder from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of
the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognize foreign
currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the
disposition date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source
ordinary income or loss.

Gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition
of a Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal
amount of such Note generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss. Gain or loss attributable to
fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of a Note generally will
equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s foreign currency purchase
price for the Note, determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement,
redemption or other taxable disposition, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s foreign currency
purchase price for the Note, determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date the U.S. holder
purchased the Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable
disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder may recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable
to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest and accrued OID, if any, which
will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of stated interest” or “—Original Issue Discount,”
as applicable. However, upon a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of
a Note, a U.S. holder will recognize any foreign currency exchange gain or loss (including with respect
to accrued and unpaid interest and OID, if any) only to the extent of total gain or loss realized by such
U.S. holder on such disposition.

Any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable
disposition of a Note in excess of foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to such disposition
generally will be U.S. source gain or loss and generally will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of
non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) derived in respect of capital assets held for more than
one year are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject
to limitations.

U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding how to account for payments made in a foreign
currency with respect to the acquisition, sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a
Note and the foreign currency received upon a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition
of a Note.

**_Foreign tax credit_**

Stated interest income and OID, if any, on a Note generally will constitute foreign source income and
generally will be considered passive category income in computing the foreign tax credit allowable to
U.S. holders under U.S. federal income tax laws. There are significant complex limitation on a U.S.
holder’s ability to claim foreign tax credits. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the
credibility or deductibility of any withholding taxes.

Any foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss and be
treated, for foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss, and generally not as an
adjustment to interest income expense.

**_Additional notes_**

The Issuer may issue Additional Notes as described under “Description of the Notes.” These Additional
Notes, even if they are treated for non-tax purposes as part of the same series as the Notes, in some
cases may be treated as a series separate from such Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In
such case, the Additional Notes may be considered to have been issued with OID (or a greater amount
of OID) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which may adversely affect the market value of the Notes,
if the Additional Notes are not otherwise distinguishable from the Notes.

**_Information reporting and backup withholding_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of interest (including the accrual
of OID, if any) on the Notes and to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a retirement

276


-----

or redemption) of a Note paid to a U.S. holder unless such U.S. holder is an exempt recipient, and,
when required, provides evidence of such exemption. Backup withholding may apply to such payments
if the U.S. holder fails to provide a taxpayer identification number or a certification that it is not subject
to backup withholding, or otherwise fails to comply with the applicable requirements of the backup
withholding rules.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding
rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability
provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Tax return disclosure requirements_**

Treasury Regulations that require the reporting to the IRS of certain tax shelter transactions cover
certain transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign currency
transactions giving rise to losses in excess of a certain minimum amount, such as the receipt or accrual
of interest on or a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a foreign
currency note or foreign currency received in respect of a foreign currency note. U.S. holders should
consult their tax advisors to determine the tax return disclosure obligations, if any, with respect to an
investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction
Disclosure Statement).

**_Information with respect to foreign financial assets_**

Individuals that own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in excess of certain
thresholds generally are required to file an information report (IRS Form 8938) with respect to such
assets with their tax returns. The Notes generally will constitute specified foreign financial assets subject
to these reporting requirements, unless the Notes are held in certain accounts maintained by certain
financial institutions. Under certain circumstances, an entity may be treated as an individual for
purposes of these rules.

U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure
requirements to their ownership of the Notes, including the significant penalties for non-compliance.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Pursuant to section 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as “FATCA”), a
“foreign financial institution” may be required to withhold U.S. tax on certain “foreign passthru payments”
made after December 31, 2018, to the extent such payments are treated as attributable to certain U.S.
source payments. Under recently proposed regulations, any withholding on foreign passthru payments
on Notes that are not otherwise grandfathered would apply to passthru payments made on or after the
date that is two years after the date of publication in the Federal Register of applicable final regulations
defining foreign passthru payments. Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed regulations until
final regulations are issued. Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date
on which applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments are published in the Federal
Register generally would be “grandfathered” unless materially modified after such date. Accordingly, if
the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA could apply to payments on the Notes only
if there is a significant modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration
of this grandfathering period. However, if Additional Notes (as described under “Description of the
_Notes”) are issued after the expiration of the grandfathering period, have the same Common Code or_
ISIN as the Notes and are subject to withholding under FATCA, then withholding agents may treat all
notes in such series, including the relevant Notes, as subject to withholding under FATCA. Non-U.S.
governments have entered into agreements with the United States (and additional non-U.S.
governments are expected to enter into such agreements) to implement FATCA in a manner that alters
the rules described herein. Holders should consult their own tax advisors on how these rules may apply
to their investment in the Notes. In the event any withholding under FATCA is imposed with respect to
any payments on the Notes, there will be no additional amounts payable to compensate for the withheld
amount.

**Swedish tax considerations**

The following summary outlines certain Swedish tax consequences relating to holders of Notes. The
summary is based on the laws of Sweden as currently in effect and is intended to provide general
information only. The summary does not address, inter alia, situations where Notes are held in an
investment savings account (Sw. _investeringssparkonto), the tax consequences of a write-down or_
conversion of the Notes, the existence of the ability of relevant regulatory authorities to effect such a
write-down or conversion, any tax consequences following a variation or substitution (instead of
redemption) of any Notes or the rules regarding reporting obligations for, among others, payers of
interest. Further, the summary does not address credit of foreign taxes in Sweden. Investors should
consult a professional tax adviser regarding the Swedish tax and other tax consequences (including the
applicability and effect of tax treaties for the avoidance of double taxation) of acquiring, owning and
disposing of Notes in their particular circumstances.

_Holders not tax resident in Sweden_

Payments of any principal or any amount that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes to
the holder of any Notes should not be subject to Swedish income tax, provided that such a holder (i) is
not a resident of Sweden for Swedish tax purposes and (ii) does not have a permanent establishment
in Sweden with which the Notes are effectively connected.

However, broadly speaking, provided that the Notes are deemed to be securities taxed as shares,
private individuals who have been residents of Sweden for tax purposes due to a habitual abode or
continuous stay in Sweden at any time during the calendar year of disposal or redemption or the ten
calendar years preceding the year of disposal or redemption, are liable for capital gains taxation in
Sweden upon disposal or redemption of such Notes. In a number of cases though, the applicability of
this rule is limited by the applicable tax treaty for the avoidance of double taxation.

Swedish withholding tax, or Swedish tax deduction, is not imposed on payments of any principal or any
amount that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes except in relation to certain payments
of interest (and other distributions on Notes) to a private individual (or the estate of a deceased
individual) who is (or was) resident in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes (see “Holders tax resident in
Sweden” below).

_Holders tax resident in Sweden_

In general, for Swedish corporations and private individuals (and estates of deceased individuals) with
residence in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes, all capital income (for example, income that is
considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes and capital gains on Notes) will be taxable. Specific
tax consequences may be applicable to certain categories of corporations, for example life insurance
companies. Moreover, specific tax consequences may be applicable if, and to the extent that, a holder
of Notes realizes a capital loss on the Notes and to any currency exchange gains or losses.

If amounts that are deemed as interest for Swedish tax purposes are paid by a legal entity domiciled in
Sweden, including a Swedish branch, or in certain cases a clearing institution within the EEA, to a
private individual (or an estate of a deceased individual) with residence in Sweden for Swedish tax
purposes, Swedish preliminary taxes are normally withheld by the legal entity on such payments.
Swedish preliminary taxes should normally also be withheld on other returns on Notes (but not capital
gains), if the return is paid out together with such a payment of interest referred to above.

**Certain United Kingdom tax considerations**

The following is a general description of certain U.K. tax consequences relating to the Notes and is
based on current U.K. tax law and HM Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) published practice, both of which
may be subject to change, possibly with retrospective effect. It does not purport to be a complete
analysis of all U.K. tax considerations relating to the Notes, does not purport to constitute legal or tax
advice, relates only to persons who are the absolute beneficial owners of Notes and who hold Notes as
a capital investment, and does not deal with certain classes of persons (such as brokers or dealers in
securities and persons connected with the Issuer) to whom special rules may apply.

278


-----

Prospective noteholders should consult their own tax advisors on the U.K. tax consequences of owning
and disposing of the Notes in their particular circumstances.

_Stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax (“SDRT”)_

No liability to U.K. stamp duty will arise on the issue of the Notes to holders. We understand that no
register of the Notes will be maintained in the U.K. and, accordingly, (i) U.K. stamp duty will not normally
be payable in connection with a transfer of the Notes, provided that any instrument of transfer is
executed and retained outside the U.K. and no other action is taken in the U.K. by the transferor or
transferee, and (ii) no U.K. SDRT will be payable in respect of the issue of or any agreement to transfer
the Notes. In any event, the Notes are expected to fall within an exemption for debt instruments, so
there should be no charge to U.K. stamp duty or SDRT for a purchaser on any subsequent transfer of
the Notes.

_Information reporting_

Information relating to securities may be required to be provided to HMRC in certain circumstances.
This may include the value of the securities, details of the holders or beneficial owners of the securities
(or the persons for whom the securities are held), details of the persons to whom payments derived
from the securities are or may be paid and information and documents in connection with transactions
relating to the securities. Information may be required to be provided by, amongst others, the holders
of the securities, persons by (or via) whom payments derived from the securities are made or who
receive (or would be entitled to receive) such payments, persons who effect or are a party to
transactions relating to the securities on behalf of others and certain registrars or administrators.

In certain circumstances, the information obtained by HMRC may be provided to tax authorities in other
countries.

279

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

**General**

The U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) imposes certain
requirements on “employee benefit plans” (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) subject to Title I of
ERISA and on entities that are deemed to hold the assets of such plans (collectively, “ERISA Plans”),
and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Investments by ERISA Plans
are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including, but not limited to, the requirement of
investment prudence and diversification and the requirement that an ERISA Plan’s investments be
made in accordance with the documents governing the plan.

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets
of an ERISA Plan (as well as those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section
4975 of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts, or entities that are deemed to hold the assets
of such plans (together with ERISA Plans, “Plans”) and certain persons (who are “parties in interest”
within the meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, or “disqualified persons” within the meaning of Section
4975 of the Code) having certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative
exemption is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a
prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA
and/or the Code.

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the
administration of a Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of a Plan, or who renders
investment advice for a fee or other compensation (direct or indirect) to a Plan, is generally considered
to be a fiduciary of such Plan. Any Plan fiduciary which proposes to cause a Plan to purchase the Notes
should consult with its counsel regarding the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited
transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code to such an investment, and to confirm
that such purchase and holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or
any other violation of an applicable requirement of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law (as defined
below).

Non-U.S. plans, (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), “governmental plans” (as defined in Section
3(32) of ERISA) and certain “church plans” (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA), while not subject to
the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of
Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to non-U.S., state,
local or other federal laws or regulations that are substantially similar to the foregoing provisions of
ERISA and the Code (collectively, “Similar Law”). Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with
their counsel before purchasing the Notes to determine the need for, and the availability, if necessary,
of any exemptive relief under any such law or regulations.

Each Plan should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers or the guarantors or
any of their respective affiliates (the “Transaction Parties”) is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any
Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. The Transaction Parties are not
undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or advice based on any particular investment need,
or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. All
communications, correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the Notes
are intended to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of the Notes, and
do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment in the Notes for any specific purchaser.
The decision to purchase and hold the Notes must be made solely by each prospective Plan purchaser
on an arm’s length basis.

**Prohibited transaction exemptions**

The fiduciary of a Plan that proposes to purchase and hold any Notes should consider, among other
things, whether such purchase and holding may involve (i) the direct or indirect extension of credit to a
party in interest or a disqualified person, (ii) the sale or exchange of any property between a Plan and
a party in interest or a disqualified person, or (iii) the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party
in interest or disqualified person, of any Plan assets. Such parties in interest or disqualified persons
could include, without limitation, the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer Agents or
any of their respective affiliates. Depending on the satisfaction of certain conditions which may include

the identity of the Plan fiduciary making the decision to acquire or hold the Notes on behalf of a Plan,
Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA, Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code (which exempt certain transactions
between a Plan and non-fiduciary service providers to a Plan) or Prohibited Transaction Class
Exemption (“PTCE”) 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by an “independent qualified professional
asset manager”), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate
accounts), PTCE 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 95-60
(relating to investments by insurance company general accounts) or PTCE 96-23 (relating to
transactions directed by an in-house asset manager) (collectively, the “Class Exemptions”) could
provide an exemption from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the
Code. However, there can be no assurance that any of these Class Exemptions or any other exemption
will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes, or that all of the conditions
for any such exemption will be satisfied. Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased
or held by any person investing the assets of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding (i) are entitled
to exemption relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code and are otherwise
permissible under all applicable Similar Laws or (ii) would not otherwise constitute a non-exempt
prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or any violation of
applicable Similar Laws.

The foregoing is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive. Each Plan fiduciary (and each
fiduciary for non-U.S., governmental or church plans subject to Similar Law) should consult with its legal
advisor concerning the potential consequences to the plan under ERISA, the Code or such Similar Laws
of an investment in the Notes. The sale of a Note to a Plan is in no respect a representation by any
Transaction Party or any of their respective affiliates or representatives that such an investment meets
all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by any such Plan or that such investment is
appropriate for any such Plan.

**Representation**

Accordingly, by acceptance of a Note, or any interest therein, each purchaser and subsequent
transferee will be deemed to have represented and warranted that either (i) no portion of the assets
used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire or hold the Note constitutes assets of any Plan; or (ii)
(a) the purchase and holding of the Notes or any interest therein by it will not constitute a nonexempt
prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or similar violation
under any applicable Similar Laws, and (b) none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers or the guarantors
or any of their respective affiliates is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to the
decision to purchase or hold the Notes or is undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or give
advice in a fiduciary capacity with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”)
relating to the Notes between the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers, the Issuer will agree to sell the Notes
to the Initial Purchasers and the Initial Purchasers will agree, severally and not jointly, to purchase the
Notes from the Issuer.

The Purchase Agreement will provide that the Initial Purchasers are obligated, severally and not jointly,
to purchase all the Notes, if any are purchased. In the event that an Initial Purchaser fails or refuses to
purchase the Notes which it has agreed to purchase, the Purchase Agreement will provide that the
purchase commitments of the other Initial Purchasers may be increased up to a specified amount or
that the Purchase Agreement may be terminated.

The Purchase Agreement will provide that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by
counsel.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof.
After the initial Offering, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be
varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice.

We have agreed to provide the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees or discounts for their services
in connection with the Offering and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and
other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the
offering price set forth on the cover page hereof.

The Purchase Agreement will provide that we will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to
payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We will agree, subject
to certain limited exceptions, not to offer, sell, contract to sell, issue or otherwise dispose of, except as
provided under the Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuer or any
other member of the Group during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and
including the date that is 90 days after the date of the Purchase Agreement.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers
have agreed that they will only offer or sell the Notes: (i) in the United States to “qualified institutional
buyers” within the meaning of Rule 144A; and (ii) outside the United States in offshore transactions to
non-U.S. persons in compliance with Regulation S. Until 40 days after the commencement of the
Offering, an offer or sale of the Notes within the United States by a broker-dealer (whether or not it is
participating in the Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such
offer or sale is made otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144A. In addition, as Banca IMI S.p.A., Nykredit
Bank A/S and Swedbank AB (publ) and their affiliates are not registered with the SEC as U.S. registered
broker dealers, they will effect offers and sales of the Notes solely outside of the United States. Nordea
Bank Abp’s ability to engage in U.S. securities dealings is limited under the U.S. Bank Holding Company
Act and it may not underwrite, offer or sell securities that are offered or sold in the United States. Nordea
Bank Abp will only underwrite, offer and sell the Notes that are part of its allotment solely outside the
United States. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Rule 144A and
Regulation S, as applicable. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Transfer
_Restrictions.”_

Each Initial Purchaser will represent, warrant and agree with us that:

(1) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to
be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the
meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any
Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to us; and

(2) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything
done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

282


-----

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by
us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation
or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any
jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold,
directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or
advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or
jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or
jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to
purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose
possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe
any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the
Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

One or more Initial Purchasers may make offers or sales of the Notes in the United States through an
affiliate or any other U.S. registered broker-dealers pursuant to applicable U.S. securities laws.

The Issuer will also agree that it will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise
dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge,
contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities Act
or the safe harbor of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the
Notes.

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there is currently no market. We will apply for the
Notes to be admitted to the Securities Official List of the Exchange, without admission to trading on one
of the securities markets operated by the Exchange; however, we cannot assure you that the Notes will
be approved for listing or that such listing will be obtained, or if obtained, will be maintained.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market for the Notes as permitted by
applicable law after completing the Offering. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make
a market in the Notes, and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole
discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be
subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act. We cannot assure
you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be
able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to the Notes—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case_
_your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date
specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be seven business days (as such
term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the
Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+7”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act,
trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties
to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on
the date of pricing or the next four succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that
the Notes initially will settle in T+7, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such
trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes on the date of
pricing and the next four succeeding business days should consult their own advisors.

In connection with the Offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may engage
in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the
Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market
to stabilize the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may also
over-allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the
open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons
acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in market-making transactions as permitted by
applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the
respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing
Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time.
Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading market for, the Notes. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in_
_which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in
various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial
advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities.
The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may
provide in the future investment banking, financial advisory, commercial banking or such other services
to us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which they have received or may receive
customary fees and commissions, including in connection with the Transactions. In connection with our
strategy to review and evaluate selective acquisitions, co-investment arrangements and other business
combinations, we and our shareholders regularly engage mergers and acquisition advisors and other
financial advisors to assist us. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may have in the past
or may be currently advising us or other interested parties, and the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates
may advise us or other interested parties from time to time on other transactions in the future. Certain
of the Initial Purchasers are arrangers and/or lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Intrum
Existing MTN Program and the Intrum Existing Commercial Paper Program. The Initial Purchasers or
their affiliates may also, from time to time, hold bonds or loans of, or acquire equity positions in the
Issuer and its subsidiaries and affiliates in normal course, including allocations of the Notes, the June
2017 notes, the July 2019 Notes, the Intrum Existing MTNs, the Intrum Existing Private Placement
Bonds or the Intrum Justitia Commercial Paper Program. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may,
from time to time, engage in transactions with, and perform services for, the Issuer and its subsidiaries
and affiliates in the ordinary course of their business. The Issuer currently provides debt collection and
related services to certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates and may continue to provide
such services in the future.

Affiliates of certain of the Initial Purchasers have in the past and may in the future sell portfolios of
overdue debt and other overdue receivables to the Issuer or its subsidiaries. In the past we have entered
into co-investment arrangements with affiliates of certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates to
purchase portfolios of overdue debt and other receivables and may enter into similar arrangements in
the future. A portion of the proceeds of the Offering may be used to repay outstanding indebtedness
under the Revolving Credit Facility. As a result, certain of the Initial Purchasers that are lenders under
the Revolving Credit Facility may receive a portion of the proceeds of the Offering.

In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are or may be in the future party to certain
of our hedging arrangements and other financing and/or debt arrangements and may hold other
proprietary positions in us, our current or future subsidiaries and affiliates and/or financial intermediaries
and the financial instruments issued by any of them.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of
any of the Notes offered hereby.

We have not registered and will not register the Notes under the U.S. Securities Act and, therefore, the
Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in
a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. Accordingly, we
are offering and selling the Notes to the Initial Purchasers for re-offer and resale only:

- to U.S. investors that we reasonably believe to be “qualified institutional buyers” (“QIBs”) (as
defined in Rule 144A) in compliance with Rule 144A; and

- outside the United States in offshore transactions to non-U.S. persons in compliance with
Regulation S.

We use the terms “offshore transaction” and “United States” with the meanings given to them in
Regulation S.

Each purchaser of Notes, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented
to and agreed with the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

(1) It understands and acknowledges that the Notes have not been registered under the U.S.
Securities Act or any other applicable state securities laws, and that the Notes are being offered
for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the U.S. Securities Act or any state
securities law, including sales in reliance on Rule 144A or Regulation S, and, unless so registered,
may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except in compliance with the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable state securities laws, pursuant to
an exemption therefrom or in any transaction not subject thereto, and in each case in compliance
with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) below.

(2) It is not an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144) of the Issuer or acting on behalf of the Issuer and it
is either:

(a) a QIB and is aware that any sale of the Notes to it will be made in reliance on Rule 144A,
and the acquisition of Notes will be for its own account or for the account of a party that is a
QIB; or

(b) a non-U.S. person purchasing the Notes in an offshore transaction in compliance with
Regulation S.

(3) It acknowledges that none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Principal Paying Agent, the Transfer
Agent, the Registrar or the Initial Purchasers, or any person representing any of them, have made
any representation to it with respect to the offering or sale of the Notes, other than the information
contained in this Offering Memorandum, which Offering Memorandum has been delivered to it
and upon which it is relying in making its investment decision with respect to the Notes. It has had
access to such financial and other information concerning the Issuer and its subsidiaries and the
Notes as it has deemed necessary in connection with its decision to purchase any of the Notes,
including an opportunity to ask questions of, and request information from, the Issuer and the
Initial Purchasers.

(4) It is purchasing the Notes for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which it is
acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or
sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the U.S. Securities Act or any state
securities laws, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property
of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and subject to its or
their ability to resell such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other exemption from
registration available under the U.S. Securities Act.

(5) It agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is purchasing the
Notes, as applicable, and each subsequent holder of the Notes by its acceptance thereof will be
deemed to agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Notes prior to the end of the resale

restriction periods described below only: (i) to the Issuer or any subsidiary thereof; (ii) pursuant to
a registration statement that has been declared effective under the U.S. Securities Act; (iii) for so
long as the Notes are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person it reasonably believes
is a QIB who purchases for its own account or for the account of a QIB to whom notice is given
that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A; (iv) pursuant to offers and sales that
occur outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in compliance with Regulation S; or (v)
pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities
Act, subject in each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of its
property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their
control and in compliance with any applicable state securities laws, and any applicable local laws
and regulations, and further subject to the Issuer’s and the Trustee’s rights prior to any such offer,
sale or transfer: (a) pursuant to clause (iv) or (v) to require the delivery of an opinion of counsel,
certification and/or other information satisfactory to each of them; and (b) in each of the foregoing
cases, to require that a certificate of transfer in the form appearing on the reverse of the security

will not apply subsequent to the Resale Restriction Termination Date. The foregoing restrictions
on resale will apply (i) in case of Notes sold in reliance on Rule 144A, from the Issue Date until
the date that is one year after the later of the Issue Date and the last date that the Issuer or any
of its affiliates was the owner of the Notes or (ii) in case of Notes sold in reliance on Regulation
S, 40 days after the later of the commencement of this Offering and the closing of this Offering
(each, a “Resale Restriction Period”) and will not apply after the applicable Resale Restriction
Period ends.

it shall be deemed to have represented and covenanted that, either (a) it is not acquiring the Notes
or any interest therein for or on behalf of (and for so long as it holds the Notes or any interest
therein will not be and will not be acting on behalf of) (i) any “employee benefit plan” (as defined
in Section 3(3) of ERISA) that is subject to Title I, (ii) any “plan” (as defined in Section 4975(e)(1)
of the Code that is subject to Section 4975 of the Code, (iii) any entity the assets of which are
considered to include “plan assets” of any plans described above in subsections (i) or (ii) (within
the meaning of U.S. Department of Labor Regulation 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as amended
by Section 3(42) of ERISA), or (iv) any plan, such as a foreign plan (as described in Section 4(b)(4)
of ERISA), governmental plan (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA) or church plan (as defined
in Section 3(33) of ERISA or Section 4975(g)(3) of the Code) that is not subject to Title I of ERISA
but that is subject to any federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are similar
to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (a “Similar Law”) (each a “Plan”), or (b) (i) the
acquisition, holding and disposition of the Notes or any interest therein are exempt from the
prohibited transaction restrictions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code (or in
the case of a plan that is subject to a Similar Law, exempt from the analogous provisions of such
Similar Law), pursuant to one or more applicable statutory or administrative exemptions and (ii)
none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers or the guarantors or any of their respective affiliates is
acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the
Notes or is undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or give advice in a fiduciary capacity
with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the notes.

(7) Each purchaser acknowledges that each Note will contain a legend substantially to the following
effect:

The following legend shall also be included, if applicable:

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS SUPPLIED SOLELY FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX
PURPOSES. THIS NOTE HAS BEEN ISSUED WITH “ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT” WITHIN
THE MEANING OF SECTION 1273 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS
AMENDED, FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. UPON WRITTEN REQUEST, THE
ISSUER WILL PROMPTLY MAKE AVAILABLE TO ANY HOLDER OF THIS NOTE THE
FOLLOWING INFORMATION: (1) THE ISSUE PRICE AND DATE OF THE NOTE, (2) THE
AMOUNT OF ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT ON THE NOTE AND (3) THE YIELD TO MATURITY
OF THE NOTE. HOLDERS SHOULD CONTACT THE ISSUER AT HESSELMANS TORG 14,
NACKA, SE 105 24 STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN, ATTENTION: TREASURER.

Each purchaser of the Notes will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions
apply to holders of beneficial interests in the Notes, as well as to holders of the Notes.

(8) It agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers the Notes notice of any restrictions
on transfer of such Notes.

(9) It acknowledges that until 40 days after the commencement of the Offering, any offer or sale of
the Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may
violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made
otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A.

(10) If it is a non-U.S. person in a sale that occurs outside the United States within the meaning of
Regulation S, it acknowledges that until the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period (as
defined below), it shall not make any offer or sale of the Notes to a U.S. person or for the account
or benefit of a U.S. person within the meaning of Rule 902 of Regulation S. The “Distribution
Compliance Period” means the 40-day period following the issue date for the Notes.

(11) It acknowledges that the Registrar will not be required to accept for registration or transfer any
Notes acquired by it except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to the Issuer and the
Registrar that the restrictions set forth therein have been complied with.

(12) It acknowledges that the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the
Registrar and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing acknowledgements,
representations, warranties and agreements and agrees that if any of the acknowledgements,
representations, warranties and agreements deemed to have been made by its purchase of the
Notes is no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify the Initial Purchasers. If it is acquiring any
Notes as a fiduciary or an agent for one or more investor accounts, it represents that it has sole
investment discretion with respect to each such investor account and that it has full power to make
the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf of each such
investor account.

(13) It understands that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by
the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would result in a public offering of the Notes or the
possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating

any transfer of the Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set forth under “Plan of

**ENFORCEMENT OF FOREIGN JUDGMENTS AND SERVICE OF PROCESS**

The Issuer is a public limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Sweden.

Many of our directors, officers and other executives are neither residents nor citizens of the United
States. Furthermore, most of our assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not
be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon such persons or us
or to enforce against them or us judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions
of U.S. federal or state securities laws despite the fact that, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, we
have appointed, or will appoint, an agent for the service of process in New York. It may be possible for
investors to effect service of process within Sweden upon those persons or us or over our subsidiaries
provided that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in
Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer, investors will need to enforce such judgment
in jurisdictions where the Issuer has assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S. court judgments
outside the United States is described below for Sweden, you should consult with your own advisors in
any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in Sweden or elsewhere outside the United
States.

**Sweden**

It is not established by Swedish judicial precedent or otherwise by Swedish law that a power of attorney
or a mandate of agency, including the appointment of a service of process agent, can be made
irrevocable and therefore any powers of attorney or mandates of agency issued by a Swedish party can
be revoked and will terminate by operation of law and without notice at the bankruptcy or temporal
demise of the Swedish party giving such powers.

The principal rule is that foreign judgments are neither recognized nor enforced in Sweden, unless such
judgments pertain to a civil or commercial matter (but not for example bankruptcy) rendered by a court
of another EU Member State or member state of the Economic Free Trade Association (“EFTA”), or
judgments rendered by a court of another Nordic country.

The United States and Sweden do not currently have a convention or treaty providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of court judgments, other than arbitral awards, in civil and commercial
matters. Therefore, a final judgment for payment of money rendered by a federal or state court in the
United States in civil and commercial matters, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or
state securities laws, would not be directly enforceable, either in whole or in part, in Sweden.

In order to enforce any such judgment in Sweden, proceedings must therefore be initiated by way of
civil law action on the judgment debt before a court of competent jurisdiction in Sweden, or an
administrative tribunal or executive or other public authority of Sweden. Enforcement of any such
judgments in Sweden, would not be recognized or enforceable in Sweden as a matter of right without
a retrial on its merits (but will be persuasive authority as a matter of evidence before the courts of law,
administrative tribunals or executive or other public authorities of Sweden). However, there is Swedish
case law to indicate that such judgments:

(a) that are based on contract which expressly exclude the jurisdiction of the courts of Sweden;

(b) that were rendered under observance of due process of law;

(c) against which there lies no further right to appeal; and

(d) the recognition of which would not manifestly contravene fundamental principles of the legal order
or the public policy of Sweden,

should be acknowledged without retrial on its merits.

Any legal proceedings in the courts of Sweden will be conducted in Swedish and a court or enforcement
authority in Sweden may require, as a further condition for admissibility and/or enforceability the
translation into Swedish of any relevant document, and assistance from Swedish authorities in the

292


-----

service of process in connection with foreign proceedings might require the observance of certain
procedural and other regulations.

Pursuant to the provisions of the Council Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament
and of the Council of 12 December 2012, on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of
judgments in civil and commercial matters (the “2012 Brussels I Regulation”), a judgment entered
against a company in the courts of a Member State (as defined therein, i.e. all EU Member States) and
which is enforceable in such a Member State, will be directly enforceable in Sweden upon the
satisfaction of the formal requirements of the 2012 Brussels I Regulation without any declaration of
enforceability being required. It should be noted, however, that a party may apply for refusal of
recognition or refusal of enforcement, as applicable, in accordance with the 2012 Brussels I Regulation.
Such an application shall be submitted to the relevant district court (Sw. tingsrätt) in Sweden.

With regard to the provisions of the 2007 Lugano Convention on the Recognition of Judgments in Civil
and Commercial Matters (the “Lugano Convention”), a judgment entered against a company in the
courts of a Contracting State (as defined in therein, i.e. all EU Member States and member states of
the EFTA other than Liechtenstein (namely Iceland, Switzerland and Norway) and which is enforceable
in such Contracting State, will be directly enforceable in Sweden only upon the satisfaction of the
following requirements: (a) that a motion for enforcement has been filed with the relevant district court
(Sw. tingsrätt) in Sweden as provided by law and has been granted; (b) that no appeals lie against the
judgment entered in the courts of such Contracting State; (c) that the courts of such Contracting State
had jurisdiction; (d) that summons has been duly served on the respondent in the proceedings before
the courts of such Contracting State; (e) that the judgment is not inconsistent with a prior judgment
given between the same parties in the same matter; and (f) that the judgment does not contravene
fundamental principles of the legal order or the public policy of Sweden.

Judgments which are not within the scope of the Brussels I Regulation or Brussels I Regulation Recast
(as applicable) or Lugano Convention would, with very limited exceptions, not be recognized or enforced
in Sweden without a retrial on the merits. This would for example apply to judgments from United States
and other non-EU/EFTA countries. As a result, when the United Kingdom leaves the European Union,
an English court judgement entered against a company incorporated in Sweden may not be recognized
or enforceable in Sweden (absent any replacement arrangements being put in place).

Swedish courts may award judgments or give awards in currencies other than the local currency, but
the judgment debtor has the right under the laws of Sweden to pay the judgment debt (even though
denominated in a foreign currency) in the local currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date
of payment (however, the judgment creditor may, subject to availability of the foreign currency, convert
such local currency into the foreign currency after payment and remove such foreign currency from
Sweden), and a choice of currency provisions by the parties to an agreement may not be upheld by
Swedish courts to constitute a right to refuse payment in Swedish kronor.

**Other information**

**Parent Company**

The Group’s publicly listed Parent Company, Intrum AB (publ), owns the subsidiaries, provides the
Group’s head office functions and handles certain Group-wide development work, services and
marketing.

The Parent Company reported net revenues of SEK 116 M (88) for the first half of the year and earnings
before tax of SEK �1,095 M (32), including share dividends and gains on disposals attributable to
subsidiaries of SEK 158 M (1,643). Earnings for the first half of 2018 included the Parent Company’s
gains on disposals of subsidiaries, which corresponded to amounts differing from the earnings in the
consolidated accounts. During the first half of the year, the Parent Company invested SEK 61 M (7) in
fixed assets and held cash and cash equivalents of SEK 100 M (68). The average number of employees
was 68 (72).

**Accounting principles**

This interim report has been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and IAS 34 Interim
Financial Reporting for the Group and in accordance with Chapter 9 of the Annual Accounts Act for the
Parent Company.

In addition to appearing in the financial statements, disclosures in accordance with IAS 34.16A also
appear in other parts of the interim report.

The accounting principles applied by the Group and the Parent company are substantially unchanged in
comparison to the Annual Report 2018, however with the exceptions noted below.

The Group applies IFRS 16 Leases as of 2019. See also Note 1 in the 2018 Annual Report. IFRS 16
stipulates that for both financial and operational leases of significance, a right of use asset and a lease
liability are to be recognised. Exceptions are short-term leases and leases for assets with a low value,
where the leasing cost is recognized on a straight-line basis. The right of use asset is recognised with
linear amortisation over the term of the contract. The lease liability is recognised including interest
expenses in accordance with the effective interest rate method. The implementation of IFRS 16 entails
the recognition of leasing liabilities for leases which were previously classified as operational leases
under IAS 17. The liabilities are calculated as the present value of future minimum lease payments
discounted at the incremental borrowing rate. Intrum applied the modified retroactive method, meaning
that the effect of introducing IFRS 16 was recognised directly against the opening balance without the
comparison figures being recalculated. The principal effects on Intrum’s accounting were that the Group’s
total assets increased by SEK 709 M, calculated as per the beginning of 2019, with both an asset and a
liability being reported for leases in effect (and where the amount is updated monthly), and with operating
earnings improving by a preliminary SEK 40 M annually through the implicit interest expense in the leases
being reported in net financial items rather than in operating earnings.

Intrum has also made a new interpretation of the rules in RFR 2 Accounting legal entities, entailing the
Parent Company’s exchange rate differences attributable to the hedging of the Group’s exchange rate
risk in foreign operations no longer being reported under Other comprehensive income but under Net
financial items in the Parent Company’s income statement. Comparison figures for the preceding year
were recalculated in the same way. The amended interpretation with regard to the Parent Company’s
accounting has no impact on shareholder’s equity in the Parent Company or on the consolidated financial
statements.

**Transactions with related parties**

During the quarter, there have been no significant transactions between Intrum and other closely related
companies, boards or Group management teams.

**Market development and outlook**

In Intrum’s balanced business model, consisting of credit management services and portfolio
investments, we see strong development in both areas. Much of the groundwork has now been done to
enable us to start the execution of our production transformation program in our credit management
operations. Intrum will gradually centralise, standardise and improve large parts of the collection process.
We anticipate the actions being taken in this area continuing to improve efficiency and the CMS margin

throughout 2019 and onwards. A continued high level of activity can be observed throughout Europe in
the market for past-due credits.

**Significant risks and uncertainties**

Risks to which the Group and Parent Company are exposed include risks relating to economic
developments, Brexit, compliance and changes in regulations, reputation risks, tax risks, risks
attributable to IT and information management, risks attributable to acquisitions, market risks, liquidity
risks, credit risks, risks inherent in portfolio investments and payment guarantees, as well as financing
risks. The risks are described in more detail in the Board of Directors’ report in Intrum’s 2018 Annual
Report. No significant risks are considered to have arisen besides those described in the Annual Report.

**Fair value of financial instruments**

Most of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities (portfolio investments, accounts receivable, other
receivables, cash and equivalents, liabilities to credit institutions, bonds, commercial papers, accounts
payable and other liabilities) are carried in the accounts at amortized cost. For these financial
instruments, the carrying amount is assessed to be a good estimate of fair value. The Group also has
financial assets and liabilities in the form of currency forward exchange contracts, which are carried in the
accounts at fair value in the income statement. They amount to small sums.

**Seasonal effects**

Intrum’s operations are, to some extent, seasonal, since collection is often somewhat lower during the
summer holiday months and in months with few working days, but slightly higher during months when end
customers receive tax refunds and other one-off payments from public authorities and employers.

**Acquisitions**

_Solvia_

During the quarter, Intrum acquired Solvia Servicios Inmobiliaros (Solvia) from Banco Sabadell. The
acquisition entails Intrum acquiring 80 percent of the shares in Solvia while Banco Sabadell retains
20 percent. Solvia is one of Spain’s leading suppliers of real estate management services.

_Piraeus Bank Recovery Business Unit_

During the quarter, Intrum also agreed with Piraeus Bank to acquire the bank’s platform for management
of overdue receivables. The operations will be sepa-rated from the bank and consolidated by Intrum in a
separate legal entity valued at EUR 410 M. Intrum will acquire 80 percent of the shares in the company for
a purchase consideration of EUR 328 M, of which EUR 296 M will be paid in cash on completion of the
transaction and the remainder being paid after the end of 2022. The transaction builds on a long-term
strategic partnership with Piraeus Bank as the holder of the remaining 20 percent of the shares. The

**Review report**

To the Board of Intrum AB (publ), corporate identity number 556607-7581.

**Introduction**

We have reviewed the condensed interim report for Intrum AB (publ) as at June 30, 2019 and for the six
months period then ended. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the
preparation and presentation of this interim report in accordance with IAS 34 and the Swedish Annual
Accounts Act. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on this interim report based on our review.

**Scope of review**

We conducted our review in accordance with the International Standard on Review Engagements,
ISRE 2410 Review of Interim Financial Statements Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity. A
review consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters,
and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit
conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and other generally accepted auditing
standards in Sweden.

The procedures performed in a review do not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware
of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit
opinion.

**Conclusion**

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim report is
not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34 and the Swedish Annual Accounts Act
regarding the Group, and in accordance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act regarding the Parent
Company.

**Definitions**

**Result concepts, key figures and alternative indicators**

**Consolidated net revenues**

Consolidated net revenues include external credit management income (variable collection
commissions, fixed collection fees, debtor fees, guarantee commissions, subscription income, etc.),
income from portfolio investments operations (collected amounts less amortization and revaluations for
the period) and other income from financial services (fees and net interest from financing services).

**Operating earnings (EBIT)**

Operating earnings consist of net revenues less operating expenses as shown in the income statement.

**Operating margin**

The operating margin consists of operating earnings expressed as a percentage of net revenues.

**Portfolio investments—collected amounts, amortizations and revaluations**

Portfolio investments consist of portfolios of delinquent consumer debts purchased at prices below the
nominal receivable. These are recognized at amortized cost applying the effective interest method, based
on a collection forecast established at the acquisition date of each portfolio. Net revenues attributable to
portfolio investments consist of collected amounts less amortization for the period and revaluations. The
amortization represents the period’s reduction in the portfolio’s current value, which is attributable to
collection taking place as planned. Revaluation is the period’s increase or decrease in the current value of
the portfolios attributable to the period’s changes in forecasts of future collection.

**Organic growth**

Organic growth refers to the average increase in net revenues in local currency, adjusted for revaluations
of portfolio investments and the effects of acquisitions and divestments of Group companies. Organic
growth is a measure of the development of the Group’s existing operations that management has the
ability to influence.

**Service line earnings**

Service line earnings relate to the operating earnings of each service line, Credit Management and
Financial Services, excluding common costs for sales, marketing and administration.

**Service line margin**

The service line margin consists of service line earnings expressed as a percentage of net revenues.

**Return on portfolio investments**

Return on portfolio investments is the service line earnings for the period, excluding operations in
factoring and payment guarantees, recalculated on a full-year basis, as a percentage of the average
carrying amount of the balance-sheet item purchased debt. The ratio sets the service line’s earnings in
relation to the amount of capital tied up and is included in the Group’s financial targets.

**Net debt**

Net debt is interest-bearing liabilities and pension provisions less liquid assets and interest-bearing
receivables.

**Cash EBITDA**

Cash EBITDA is operating earnings after depreciation on fixed assets as well as amortization and
revaluations of portfolio investments are added back.

F-26


-----

**Adjusted operating earnings (EBIT)**

Adjusted operating earnings (EBIT) is operating earnings excluding revaluations of portfolio investments
and other items affecting comparability.

**RTM**

The abbreviation RTM refers to figures on a rolling 12-month basis.

**Net debt/RTM operating earnings before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)**

This key figure refers to net debt divided by consolidated operating earnings before depreciation,
amortization and impairment (EBITDA) on a rolling 12-month basis. The key figure is included among the
Group’s financial targets, is an important measure for assessing the level of the Group’s borrowings and
is a widely accepted measure of financial capacity among lenders. This key figure is calculated in
accordance with the definitions stated in the terms of the Group’s revolving syndicated loan facility, which
means, among other things, that participations in joint ventures is only included to the extent that earnings
are distributed to Intrum and that operations acquired during the period are included on a pro forma-basis
throughout the 12-month period.

**Currency-adjusted change**

With regard to trends in revenues and operating earnings, excluding revaluations for each region, the
percentage change is stated in comparison with the corresponding year-earlier period, both in terms of
the change in the respective figures in SEK and in the form of a currency-adjusted change, in which the
effect of changes in exchange rates has been excluded. The currency-adjusted change is a measure of
the development of the Group’s operations that management has the ability to influence.

**Items affecting comparability**

Significant earnings items that are not included in the Group’s normal recurring operations and that are
not expected to return on a regular basis. These include revaluations of portfolio investments,
restructuring costs, closure costs, reversal of restructuring or closure reservations, cost savings
programs, integration costs, extraordinary projects, divestments, impairment of non-current fixed assets
other than portfolio investments, acquisition and divestment expenses, advisory costs for discontinued
acquisition projects, costs for relocation to new office space, termination and recruitment costs for
members of Group Management and country managers, as well as external expenses for disputes and
unusual agreements. Items affecting comparability are specified because they are difficult to predict and
have low forecast values for the Group’s fu-ture earnings trend.

**Amortization percentage**

Amortization on portfolio investments during the period, as a percentage of collections.

**Estimated remaining collections, ERC**

The estimated remaining collections represent the nominal value of the expected future collection on the
Group’s portfolio investments, including Intrum’s anticipated cash flows from investments in joint
ventures.

**Cash multiple**

investments, as a share of the total invested amount.

Most of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities (purchased debt, accounts receivable, other
receivables, cash and equivalents, liabilities to credit institutions, bonds, commercial papers, accounts
payable and other liabilities) are carried in the accounts at amortized cost. For these financial
instruments, the carrying amount is assessed to be a good estimate of fair value. The Group also has
financial assets and liabilities in the form of currency forward exchange contracts, which are carried in the
accounts at fair value in the income statement. They amount to small sums.

**Definitions**

**Result concepts, key figures and alternative performance measures**

**Consolidated net revenues**

Consolidated net revenues include external credit management income (variable collection
commissions, fixed collection fees, debtor fees, guarantee commissions, subscription income, etc.),
income from portfolio investments operations (collected amounts less amortization and revaluations for
the period) and other income from financial services (fees and net interest from financing services).

**Operating earnings (EBIT)**

Operating earnings consist of net revenues less operating expenses as shown in the income statement.

**Operating margin**

The operating margin consists of operating earnings expressed as a percentage of net revenues.

**Portfolio investments—collected amounts, amortizations and revaluations**

Portfolio investments consist of portfolios of delinquent consumer debts purchased at prices below the
nominal receivable. These are recognized at amortized cost applying the effective interest method, based
on a collection forecast established at the acquisition date of each portfolio. Net revenues attributable to
portfolio investments consist of collected amounts less amortization for the period and revaluations. The
amortization represents the period’s reduction in the portfolio’s current value, which is attributable to
collection taking place as planned. Revaluation is the period’s increase or decrease in the current value of
the portfolios attributable to the period’s changes in forecasts of future collection.

**Revenues, operating earnings and operating margin, excluding revaluations**

The revaluation of portfolio investments in the period is included in consolidated net revenues and
operating earnings. Revaluations are performed in connection with changes in estimates of future
collections and are therefore inherently difficult to predict. They have low forecast values for future
earnings trends, particularly for an individual geographical region. Consequently, Intrum also reports
alternative key figures in which revenues, operating earnings and operating margin are calculated
excluding purchased debt revaluations.

**Organic growth**

Organic growth refers to the average increase in net revenues in local currency, adjusted for revaluations
of portfolio investments and the effects of acquisitions and divestments of Group companies. Organic
growth is a measure of the development of the Group’s existing operations that management has the
ability to influence.

**Service line earnings**

Service line earnings relate to the operating earnings of each service line, Credit Management and
Financial Services, excluding common costs for sales, marketing and administration.

**Service line margin**

The service line margin consists of service line earnings expressed as a percentage of net revenues.

**Return on portfolio investments**

Return on portfolio investments is the service line earnings for the period, excluding the Group’s new
services such as factoring and payment guarantees, recalculated on a full-year basis, as a percentage of
the average carrying amount of the balance-sheet item purchased debt. The ratio sets the service line’s
earnings in relation to the amount of capital tied up and is included in the Group’s financial targets.

**Net debt**

Net debt is interest-bearing liabilities and pension provisions less liquid assets and interest-bearing
receivables.

F-45


-----

**EBITDA**

Operating earnings before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) are operating earnings after reversal
of depreciation of fixed assets except portfolio investments.

**Cash EBITDA**

Cash EBITDA is operating earnings after depreciation on fixed assets as well as amortization and
revaluations of portfolio investments are added back.

**RTM**

The abbreviation RTM refers to figures on a rolling 12-month basis.

**Net debt/RTM operating earnings before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)**

This key figure refers to net debt divided by consolidated operating earnings before depreciation,
amortization and impairment (EBITDA) on a rolling 12-month basis. The key figure is included among the
Group’s financial targets, is an important measure for assessing the level of the Group’s borrowings, and
is a widely-accepted measure of financial capacity among lenders.

**Currency-adjusted change**

With regard to trends in revenues and operating earnings, excluding revaluations for each region, the
percentage change is stated in comparison with the corresponding year-earlier period, both in terms of
the change in the respective figures in SEK and in the form of a currency-adjusted change, in which the
effect of changes in exchange rates has been excluded. The currency-adjusted change is a measure of
the development of the Group’s operations that management has the ability to influence.

**Non-recurring items (NRIs)**

Significant earnings items that are not included in the Group’s normal recurring operations and that are
not expected to return on a regular basis. Non-recurring items include restructuring costs, closure costs,
reversal of restructuring or closure reservations, cost savings programs, integration costs, extraordinary
projects, divestments, impairment of non-current fixed assets other than portfolio investments,
acquisition and divestment costs, advisory costs for discontinued acquisition projects, costs for relocation
to new office space, termination and recruitment costs for members of Group Management and country
managers, as well as external costs for disputes and unusual agreements. Non-recurring items are
specified because they are difficult to predict and have low forecast values for the Group’s future earnings
trend.

**Items affecting comparability**

Significant income statement items included in the Group’s regular recurring operations and which may
recur in any form, but which distort the comparison between the periods.

**EBIT, EBITDA and Cash EBITDA, excluding NRIs**

In accordance with the above, the key figures EBIT, EBITDA and Cash EBITDA are also reported after
recurring non-recurring items, NRIs.

**Expected remaining collections, ERC**

Estimated remaining collections are the nominal value of expected future collections on the Group’s
portfolio investments.

**Pro forma financial reports including Lindorff**

Pro forma financial reports are issued for the Group including Lindorff, as if Lindorff had been included in
the Group for the entire period, as well as in the comparative figures. Pro forma earnings have been
calculated by adding Intrum’s and Lindorff’s actual results for each period without making adjustments for
the periods in which transaction costs would have been incurred if the acquisition had taken place at
another time. Fair value adjustments made in the acquisition analysis on Intrum Justitia’s acquisition of

F-46


-----

Lindorff are not recognized in earnings for any period, although they can be recognized as costs in the
acquired legal entity.

**Portfolio investments**

Investments in portfolios of overdue receivables for the period, with and without collateral, and
investments in properties held for sale, acquired together with portfolios of receivables.

**Region Northern Europe**

Region Northern Europe comprises the Group’s activities for external clients and debtors in Denmark,
Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden.

**Region Central and Eastern Europe**

Region Central and Eastern Europe comprises the Group’s activities for external clients and debtors in
Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Switzerland.

**Region Western and Southern Europe**

Region Western & Southern Europe comprises the Group’s activities for external clients and debtors in
Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and the United Kingdom.

**Region Spain**

Region Spain comprises the Group’s activities for external clients and debtors in Spain.

**Note 1: Significant accounting and valuation principles**

**General**

The Parent Company Intrum AB (publ) is a registered company domiciled in Stockholm, Sweden. The
address of the Company’s headquarters is Hesselmans Torg 14, Nacka, SE-105 24 Stockholm, Sweden.
During 2018, the Company was listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm, Large Cap list.

The consolidated accounts were approved for publication by the Company’s Board of Directors on
28 March 2019. The balance sheets and income statements will be presented to the Annual General
Meeting on 26 April 2019.

The Parent Company’s functional currency is Swedish kronor (SEK), which is also the reporting currency
for the Parent Company and for the Group. The financial statements are therefore presented in SEK. All
amounts, unless indicated otherwise, are rounded off to the nearest SEK M.

The consolidated and annual accounts pertain to 1 January–31 December for income statement items
and 31 December for balance sheet items.

**Accounting standards applied**

With regard to the consolidated financial statements, the Annual Report for Intrum AB (publ) has been
prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and the International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The Group applies
IFRS as adopted by the European Union (EU). For 2018, there are no new provisions relevant to Intrum in
the IFRS issued by the IASB that have not yet been adopted by the EU. This means that the Group’s
application of IFRS as adopted by the EU during the year also corresponds to the application of IFRS as
issued by the IASB.

Further, recommendation RFR 1 Supplementary accounting rules for groups from the Swedish Financial
Reporting Board has been applied.

The Parent Company applies the same accounting principles as the Group except in the cases stated in
the section ‘‘Parent Company accounting principles’’.

**Assumptions**

Assets and liabilities are recognised at historical cost, with the exception of certain financial assets and
liabilities, which are measured at fair value.

The preparation of financial reports in accordance with IFRS requires the Board of Directors and
Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the accounting principles
and the carrying values of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Estimates and assumptions are
based on historical experience and a number of other factors that under current circumstances seem
reasonable. The result of these estimates and assumptions is then used to determine the carrying values
of assets and liabilities that otherwise are not clearly indicated by other sources. Actual outcomes may
deviate from these estimates and assumptions.

Estimates and assumptions are reviewed regularly. Changes in estimates are recognised in the period in
which the change is made, provided it has affected only this period, or the period the change was made
and future periods if the change affects both current and future periods.

Estimates made by the Company that have a significant impact on the financial statements and
estimates, which could necessitate significant adjustments in financial statements in subsequent years,
are described in more detail in Note 36.

The accounting principles described below for the Group have been applied consistently for all periods in
the Group’s financial statements, unless otherwise indicated. The Group’s accounting principles have
been applied consistently in the consolidation of the Parent Company, subsidiaries, associated
companies and joint ventures.

**Note 1: Significant accounting and valuation principles (continued)**

**Changes in accounting principles**

_Changes that entered into force in 2018_

Since 1 January 2018, Intrum has applied IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which replaced IAS 39 Financial
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, and includes new rules for accounting of credit losses,
portfolio investments and hedge accounting. The new rules regarding loan losses and hedge accounting
had no significant effect on the Group. The new rules for portfolio investments entail Intrum continuing to
report these according to an effective interest rate model, with some minor adjustments in the application.
The greatest change is that, in accordance with IFRS 9, acquired credit-impaired receivables can be
reported at a higher recognised value than cost if estimates of future cash flows change, which differs
from Intrum’s current application of the corresponding rules under IAS 39. The effect was that earnings
brought forward in the opening balance for 2018 increased by approximately SEK 50 M after tax.
Comparative figures for previous years are not recalculated.

Since 1 January 2018, Intrum also applies IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which
replaced IAS 18 Revenue, and included new rules regarding when revenues on sales are to be reported
in certain cases. IFRS 15 is based on revenue being recognised when control of the good or service is
transferred to the customer, which differs from the previous basis in the transfer of risks and benefits.
IFRS 15 introduced new ways of determining how and when revenue should be recognised, entailing a
new approach compared with how revenue was previously reported. The sectors most affected were the
construction and civil engineering sectors, as well as companies engaged in contract manufacturing. The
new accounting rules had no significant effect on the Intrum Group but entailed new disclosure
requirements.

From 1 January 2019, the Group will apply IFRS 16 Leases, replacing IAS 17 Leases. IFRS 16 provides
that leases previously accounted for as operating leases will generally start to be reported in a manner
similar to the previous accounting of financial leases. This requires a right of use asset and a lease liability
to also be reported for an operating lease, with associated reporting of costs for depreciation and interest,
unlike previously when the leased asset and related liability were not entered in the accounts and lease
payments were amortised on a straight-line basis as a lease expense. There are exceptions for
short-term leases and leases of assets of low value. Based on the information available, the Group
expects the principal effects on Intrum’s accounting to be that the Group’s total assets will increase by a
preliminary amount of approximately SEK 450 M, calculated as per the beginning of 2019, with both an
asset and a liability being reported with regard to leases in effect at any given time, and with operating
earnings improving by a preliminary SEK 14 M through the implicit interest expense in the leases being
reported in net financial items rather than in operating earnings.

The Group plans to apply the modified retroactive method. This means that the cumulative effect of
IFRS 16 being introduced will be reported under earnings brought forward in the opening balance as of
1 January 2019 without the comparison figures being translated. Leases of low value (assets that, in new
condition, have a value of less than approximately SEK 50,000)—primarily comprising IT and office
equipment—will not be included in the leasing debt but will continue to be expensed on a straight-line
bases over the lease term. Accordingly, the amended accounting relates mainly to rented office premises
and cars.

Other changes to IFRS are not expected to have any material effect on the consolidated accounts.

**Classification issues**

Fixed assets and long-term liabilities in the Parent Company and the Group consist of amounts that are
expected to be recovered or paid more than twelve months after the balance sheet date. Current assets
and current liabilities in the Parent Company and the Group consist of amounts that are expected to be
recovered or paid within twelve months of the balance sheet date.

**Consolidation**

_Subsidiaries_

The Group applies IFRS 3 Business combinations and IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements.

F-59


-----

**Note 1: Significant accounting and valuation principles (continued)**

The consolidated accounts include the annual accounts of all subsidiaries, i.e., companies in which the
Parent Company, directly or indirectly, holds more than 50 percent of the votes or otherwise can exercise
control over operations. A controlling interest is achieved when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to
variable returns from, its commitment to the Company and is able to affect returns by means of its
decisive influence. An influence arises when the Group has existing rights enabling it to control the
relevant operations, that is, the operations that significantly affect the Company’s performance.

The consolidated accounts are prepared according to the acquisition method, which means that the
acquisition of a subsidiary is treated as a transaction where the Group indirectly acquires the subsidiary’s
assets and takes over its liabilities and contingent liabilities. The Group’s equity therefore includes only
the portion of the subsidiary’s equity added since acquisition. The Group’s cost is determined through an
acquisition analysis in connection with the acquisition. The analysis determines the cost of the shares or
operations as well as the fair value of acquired, identifiable assets and assumed liabilities and contingent
liabilities. The cost of the subsidiary’s shares or operations consists of the fair value of the compensation
on the transfer date and transaction expenses directly attributable to the acquisition. The cost includes
conditional purchase considerations recognised as liabilities at fair value per the acquisition date.
Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.

In acquisitions where the cost exceeds the net value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities and
contingent liabilities, the difference is reported as goodwill. When the difference is negative, it is
recognised directly through profit or loss.

Non-controlling interests arise in cases where the acquisition does not relate to the entire subsidiary.
There are two options for recognising non-controlling interests. The two options are to recognise the
percentage of non-controlling interests that makes up proportional net assets, or to recognise
non-controlling interests at fair value, which means that non-controlling interests form a percentage of
goodwill. The method used for recognising non-controlling interests is made on a case by case basis.

The financial reports of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated accounts from the acquisition date
until control ceases.

Intra-Group receivables and liabilities, revenue and expenses, and unrealised gains and losses that arise
from transactions within the Group are eliminated in their entirety in the consolidated accounts.

Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associated companies and joint ventures are eliminated
to a degree corresponding to the Group’s ownership of those companies. Unrealised losses are
eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, to the extent there is an indication of impairment.

_Associated companies and joint ventures_

The Group applies IAS 28 Investments in associates and joint ventures, and IFRS 11 Joint arrangements.

Associated companies are companies that are not subsidiaries but where the Parent Company, directly
or indirectly, has at least 20 percent of the votes or otherwise exercises significant influence without
having control over the partly owned company.

Participations in associated companies and joint ventures are recognised in the consolidated accounts
according to the equity method, which means that the holding in the company is recognised at cost and
subsequently adjusted to the Group’s share of the change in the associated company’s net assets. The
value of the shares includes goodwill from the acquisition. The consolidated income statement includes
the Group’s participation in the company’s earnings less goodwill impairment. The amount is reported
under Participations in the earnings of associates and joint ventures. Dividends received from the
company are not recognised in the income statement and instead reduce the carrying value of the
investment.

Any difference between the cost of an acquisition and the owner’s share of the net fair value of the
associated company’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised in accordance
with IFRS 3.

The equity method is applied from the date a significant influence arises until the time it ceases or the
associated company becomes a subsidiary.

F-60


-----

**Note 1: Significant accounting and valuation principles (continued)**

If the Group’s share of reported losses in the company exceeds the carrying value of its participations, the
value of those participations is reduced to nil. Losses can also be offset against the Group’s unsecured
receivables from the company if they constitute part of the net investment. Further losses are not
recognised provided the Group has not issued guarantees to cover them.

_Joint ventures_

The Group applies IFRS 11 Joint arrangements.

Joint arrangements pertain to companies in which Intrum and other part-owners manage operations
jointly in accordance with a shareholder agreement.

Joint arrangements classified as joint ventures are reported in the consolidated accounts in accordance
with the equity method. Joint ventures are companies in which the Group, through collaborative
agreements, shares a controlling interest with one or more parties, such that the Group is entitled to net
assets rather than having a direct entitlement to assets and responsibility for liabilities. Jointly owned
companies are recognised at cost and subsequently adjusted for the Group’s share of the change in the
company’s net assets. The consolidated income statement includes the Group’s share of earnings, and
this is reported under Participations in the earnings of associates and joint ventures. Dividends received
from joint ventures are not recognised in the income statement and instead reduce the carrying value of
the investment. The equity method is applied from the date on which joint control is gained until the date
that it ceases or transitions to the sole influence of Intrum.

Shared operations, usually conducted in a company format, are joint arrangements in which Intrum and
one or more partners are entitled to all of the financial benefits related to the assets of the operations.
Shared operations are reported according to the profit split method, meaning that each party to a joint
venture reports its share of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.

_Foreign currency_

The Group applies IAS 21 Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.

_Transactions in foreign currency_

Group companies prepare their accounts in the local functional currency in the country where they have
their operations. Transactions in a currency other than the local currency are recognised at the exchange
rate in effect on the transaction day. When such transactions are offset or settled, the exchange rate may
deviate from the one that applied on the transaction day, in which case a (realised) exchange rate
difference arises. Moreover, monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are translated at the
exchange rates on each balance sheet date, due to which an (unrealised) exchange rate difference
arises. Both realised and unrealised exchange rate differences of this type are recognised in the income
statement—in the operating result if, for example, they refer to accounts receivable or accounts payable,
or in net financial items if they refer to financial investments and borrowing in foreign currency.

To avoid exchange rate differences, receivables and liabilities in foreign currency are sometimes hedged
through forward exchange contracts. The Group’s holding of forward exchange contracts is marked to
market on each balance sheet date, and changes in value are recognised through profit or loss.

_Translation of the financial statements of foreign operations_

Assets and liabilities in foreign operations, including goodwill and other Group surplus and deficit values,
are translated from the functional currency to the Group’s reporting currency, Swedish kronor, at the
exchange rate on balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated at the average rate, which
serves as an approximation of the rate that applied on each transaction date. Translation differences
arise in the translation of subsidiary accounts in part because the balance sheet date rate changes each
period and in part because the average rate deviates from balance sheet date rate. Translation
differences are recognised directly in total comprehensive income as the year’s change in the translation
reserve.

F-61


-----

**Note 1: Significant accounting and valuation principles (continued)**

Long-term receivables and liabilities between the Parent Company and subsidiaries can be seen as an
extension or reduction of the net investment in each company. If this is the case, translation differences
are recognised under other comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements.

When foreign operations are sold, accumulated translation differences attributable to those operations
are realised.

During the year the Group did not hedge any other flow exposure pertaining to anticipated receipts or
disbursements in foreign currency.

**Financial assets and liabilities**

The Group applies IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IFRS 7
Financial Instruments: Disclosures and IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. The comparative figures for
2017 were prepared under IAS 39 rather than IFRS 9.

A financial instrument is any form of agreement giving rise to a financial asset in a company and a
financial liability or equity instrument in a counterparty.

Financial instruments recognised in the balance sheet include, on the asset side, cash and bank
balances, accounts receivable and other equity instruments, loans receivable, portfolio investments and
derivatives. Client funds are recognised on a separate line in the balance sheet and therefore are not
included in the Group’s reported liquid assets. Included among liabilities and equity are accounts payable,
client funds payable, debt and equity instruments in issue, loan liabilities and derivatives.

On initial recognition, financial assets (except accounts receivable with no significant financing
component) and financial liabilities are valued at fair value plus (in the case of financial instruments not
measured at fair value via the income statement) transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition
or issue. Accounts receivable with no significant financing component are valued at the transaction price.

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as valued at amortised cost, fair value via other
comprehensive income or at fair value via the income statement. Financial assets are not reclassified
after initial recognition, unless the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets, in
which case all of the financial assets concerned are reclassified from the first day of the reporting period
commencing after the change in business model.

A financial asset or financial liability is recognised in the balance sheet when the Company becomes party
to the instrument’s contractual terms. Receivables are recognised when the Company has performed and
there is a contractual obligation on the counterparty to pay, even if an invoice has not yet been received.
Accounts receivable are recognised in the balance sheet when an invoice has been sent. Liabilities are
recognised when the counterparty has performed and there is a contractual obligation to pay, even if an
invoice has not yet been received. Trade accounts payable are recognised when an invoice is received. A
financial asset is removed from the balance sheet when the rights in the agreement are realised, expire or
the Company loses control over them. A financial liability is removed from the balance sheet when the
obligation in the agreement has been discharged or otherwise extinguished.

The fair value of listed financial assets corresponds to their listed market price on the balance sheet date.
The fair value of unlisted financial assets is determined by using valuation techniques, e.g., recently
conducted transactions, the price of similar instruments and discounted cash flows. For forward
exchange contracts and currency interest rate swaps, fair value is determined based on listed prices. The
fair value of forward exchange contracts and currency interest rate swaps is calculated by discounting the
difference between the contracted forward rate and the forward rate that can be secured on the balance
sheet date for the remaining contract period. The current value is obtained by discounting applying the
Group’s weighted average cost of capital. For further information, see Note 34.

_Portfolio investments_

Portfolio investments consist of portfolios of delinquent receivables purchased at prices significantly
below the nominal receivable. Portfolio investments usually refer to receivables from private individuals
and are often unsecured receivables. They are reported in accordance with the rules for acquired
impaired (‘‘credit-impaired’’) receivables in IFRS 9, that is, at amortised cost applying the effective interest

F-62


-----

**Note 1: Significant accounting and valuation principles (continued)**

method and an effective interest rate reflecting the degree to which the receivable is impaired. The
portfolios belong to the third class of credit risk as defined in IFRS 9.

In the income statement, income from portfolio investments is recognised, in accordance with the
effective interest rate method, as the collected amount less amortisation. The collection is often
performed by the same personnel who handle collections and debt surveillance on behalf of external
clients within the Credit Management service line. The cost of collection is debited internally at market
price and expensed in the income statement for the Portfolio Investments service line as a cost of
services sold.

Reporting follows the effective interest method, where the carrying value of each portfolio corresponds to
the present value of all projected future cash flows discounted by an initial effective interest rate
determined on the date the portfolio was acquired, based on the relation between cost and the projected
future cash flows on the acquisition date. Changes in the carrying value of the portfolios are comprised of
amortisation for the period and are recognised in the income statement as a charge against the revenue
line.

In connection with the purchase of each portfolio of receivables, a projection is made of the portfolio’s
cash flows. Cash flows include the loan amount, reminder fees, collection fees and late interest that,
based on a probability assessment, are expected to be received from customers, less forecast collection
costs. With this forecast and the acquisition price including transaction costs as a basis, each portfolio is
assigned an initial effective interest rate that is then used to discount cash flows through the life of the
portfolio.

Current cash flow projections are monitored over the course of the year and updated based on, among
other things, achieved collection results, agreements reached with customers on instalment plans and
macro-economic information including assessments of economic development and unemployment in
each country. Cash flow projections are made at the portfolio level, since each portfolio of receivables
consists of a small number of homogeneous amounts. On the basis of the updated cash flow projections
and initial effective interest rate, a new carrying value for the portfolio is calculated in the closing accounts.

The accounting model assumes each portfolio to be relatively homogeneous and comprising a large
number of receivables for smaller amounts. Portfolios comprising individual larger receivables are valued
on acquisition and at the level of the receivables in ongoing reporting over the life cycle of the portfolio and
not at the portfolio level.

The Group applies internal application rules which mean that the initial effective interest rate can be
adjusted in certain cases without a change in the carrying value of the portfolio for minor projection
adjustments within a predetermined interval.

Changes over time in the book value can be divided into an anticipated time and interest rate component
(amortisation) and a component related to changes in estimates of future cash flows (revaluation). The
effects of changes in cash flow forecasts, including changes in the anticipated financial lifetime of the
portfolio, are referred to as revaluations and treated symmetrically, i.e., both increases and decreases in
forecast flows affect the portfolios’ book value and, as a result, earnings. This means that certain
portfolios may be valued at an amount higher than their cost.

Although selling portfolios of purchased debt is not included in the business model, when such sales do
occur as an exception, the resulting sales price received for the portfolio is reported in the same way as if
it had been recovered from the customers. The entire remaining carrying values of the portfolios are
recognised as amortisation. The comparative figures for 2017 as regards portfolio investments refer to
financial statements prepared on the basis of then existing accounting principles in IAS 39. The main
difference is that the Group in 2017 applied a rule where a portfolio was never allowed to be recognised at
a higher value than its acquisition cost.

_Long-term receivables and other receivables_

Long-term receivables and other receivables are those that arise when the Company provides money
without the intent to trade its claim. If the anticipated maturity is longer than one year they constitute
long-term receivables, and if it is shorter they are other receivables. These receivables are recognised at
amortised cost.

**Note 1: Significant accounting and valuation principles (continued)**

_Accounts receivable_

Accounts receivable are recognised at the amount expected to be received after deducting impaired
receivables, which are determined individually or according to statistical models based on historical
experience in each country. Provisions for impairment are made when the receivable is first recognised,
for expected credit losses, and adjusted as needed over the lifetime of receivable. The anticipated
maturity of accounts receivable is short, so they are carried at amortised cost without discounting.

_Legal outlays_

The Group incurs outlays for court fees, legal representation, enforcement authorities, etc., which can be
charged to and collected from customers. In certain cases Intrum has agreements with its clients where
any expenses that cannot be collected from customers are instead refunded by the client. The amount
that is expected to be recovered from a solvent counterparty is recognised as an asset in the balance
sheet on the line Other receivables. The anticipated maturity of these receivable is short, so they are
carried at amortised cost without discounting.

_Client funds_

Client funds, which are reported as assets and liabilities in the balance sheet, represent cash received on
collection of a specific debt on behalf of a client and payable to the client within a specified period. Client
funds are liquid funds with a restricted disposition right. The same amount is reported as a liability.

_Cash and cash equivalents_

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, as well as immediately available balances with
banks and similar institutions. Short-term investments consist of investments with an insignificant risk of
fluctuating in value, which can easily be converted to cash and have a maturity of not more than three
months from acquisition.

_Liabilities_

Liabilities are initially recognised at the amount received following deduction of transaction costs.
Subsequent to acquisition, loans are carried at amortised cost according to the effective rate method.
Long-term liabilities have an anticipated remaining maturity of more than one year, while short-term
liabilities have a maturity of less than one year. The Group’s long-term loans generally have short fixed
interest periods, which means that the nominal loan amount plus accrued interest is a good
approximation of the liability calculated according to the effective rate model.

_Accounts payable_

Accounts payable are classified as valued at amortised cost. However, accounts payable have a short
anticipated maturity and are carried without being discounting to a nominal amount.

_Derivatives_

Derivatives consist of forward exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and currency interest rate swaps
used to reduce interest and exchange rate risks attributable to assets and liabilities in foreign currency.
Derivatives are also contractual terms embedded in other agreements. Embedded derivatives are
recognised separately if they are not closely related to the host agreement.

Forward exchange contracts are classified as financial assets or liabilities recognised at fair value via the
income statement (held for trade) and assessed at fair value without deductions for transaction expenses
that may arise on sale or similar.

Hedge accounting is not needed for forward exchange contracts because the hedged item and the
hedging instrument are carried at the closing rate with changes in value recognised in the income
statement as exchange rate differences. Changes in the value of operations-related receivables and
liabilities are recognised in operating earnings, while changes in the value of financial receivables and
liabilities are recognised in net financial items.

F-64


-----

**Note 1: Significant accounting and valuation principles (continued)**

Currency interest rate swaps are valued at fair value and reported in the balance sheet together with
hedge accounting via Other comprehensive income. Currency interest rate swaps were signed in
connection with the Parent Company’s issue of bonds in SEK that were exchanged for EUR to hedge net
investments in foreign operations where the loan currency has been used in the operations. The liability in
SEK was exchanged into the same liability in EUR on both the starting date and the date of maturity.

_Hedge accounting with regard to exchange rate risk in the net investment in foreign subsidiaries_

Investments in foreign subsidiaries (net assets including goodwill) are to some extent hedged through
loans in foreign currency or forward exchange contracts that are translated on the closing date to the
exchange rate then in effect. Translation differences for the period on financial instruments used to hedge
a net investment in a Group company are recognised in the degree the hedge is effective in total
comprehensive income, while cumulative changes are recognised in equity (translation reserve). As a
result, translation differences that arise when Group companies are consolidated are neutralised.

**Property holdings**

The Group applies IAS 2 Inventories.

In connection with acquisitions of portfolio investments and in connection with the recovery of collateral
for acquired receivables, Intrum may become owners of property holdings or other physical goods. They
have been acquired for the purpose of being divested within the Group’s ongoing operations, and are
therefore classified as inventories. These are reported in the balance sheet at cost or net realisable value,
whichever is lower. When goods from these inventories are sold, the sales price received is recognised
as income and the amount recognised as an inventory asset is reported as an expense in the same
period.

**Intangible fixed assets**

_Goodwill_

Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of an acquisition and the fair value of the acquired
assets, assumed liabilities and contingent liabilities.

If the Group’s cost of the acquired shares in a subsidiary exceeds the market value of the subsidiary’s net
assets according to the acquisition analysis, the difference is recognised as Group goodwill. The goodwill
that can arise through business combinations implemented through other than a purchase of shares is
recognised in the same way.

For business combinations where the cost is less than the net value of acquired assets and assumed and
contingent liabilities, the difference is recognised directly through profit or loss.

Goodwill is recognised at cost less accumulated impairment. The fair value of goodwill is determined
annually for each cash-generating unit in relation to the unit’s performance and anticipated future cash
flow. If deemed necessary, goodwill is written down on the basis of this evaluation. Intrum’s operations in
each geographical region (Northern Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, Western and Southern Europe,
as well as the Iberian Peninsula and Latin America) are, in this context, considered to be the Group’s
cash-generating units. Goodwill that arises from the acquisition of a company outside Sweden is
classified as an asset in the local currency and translated in the accounts at the balance sheet date rate.

_Capitalised expenses for IT development_

The Group applies IAS 38 Intangible Assets.

Expenditures for IT development and maintenance are generally expensed as incurred. Expenditures for
software development that can be attributed to identifiable assets under the Group’s control and with
anticipated future economic benefits are capitalised and recognised as intangible assets. These
capitalised expenses include staff for the development team and other direct and indirect expenses.
Borrowing costs are included in the cost of qualified fixed assets.

Additional expenditures for previously developed software, etc. are recognised as an asset in the balance
sheet if they increase the future economic benefits of the specific asset to which they are attributable,

F-65


-----

**Note 1: Significant accounting and valuation principles (continued)**

e.g., by improving or extending a computer programme’s functionality beyond its original use and
estimated useful life.

IT development expenses that are recognised as intangible assets are amortised using the straight-line
method over their useful lives (3–5 years). Useful life is reassessed annually. The asset is recognised at
cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.

Costs associated with the maintenance of existing computer software are expensed as they are incurred.

_Client relationships_

Client relationships that are recognised as fixed assets relate to fair value revaluations recognised upon
acquisition in accordance with IFRS 3. They are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated
useful life (5–10 years). Useful life is reassessed annually. The asset is recognised at cost less
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.

_Other intangible fixed assets_

Other intangible fixed assets relate to other acquired rights are amortised on a straight-line basis over
their estimated useful life (3–5 years). Useful life is reassessed annually. The asset is recognised at cost
less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.

**Tangible fixed assets**

The Group applies IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 40 Investment Property.

Tangible fixed assets are recognised at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost
includes the purchase price and costs directly attributable to putting the asset into place and condition to
be utilised in the way intended. Examples of directly attributable costs are delivery and handling,
installation, consulting services and legal services. Depreciation is booked on a straight-line basis over
the asset’s anticipated useful life (3–5 years). Useful life is reassessed annually.

Investment properties are properties that have been acquired to be leased to others or used within the
Group’s operations rather than being sold. They are reported in accordance with the cost method,
applying depreciation over the estimated useful life of the buildings. Additional expenses are capitalised
only to the extent that they increase value in relation to performance on the date on which the property
was acquired. No depreciation is applied for land.

The carrying value of a tangible fixed asset is excluded from the balance sheet when the asset is sold or
disposed of or when no economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal of the asset. The gain or
loss that arises on the sale or disposal of an asset is comprised of the difference between the sales price
and the asset’s carrying value less direct costs to sell. Gains and losses are recognised as other
operating earnings.

An annual determination is made of each asset’s residual value and useful life.

Tangible fixed assets are recognised as an asset in the balance sheet if it is likely that the future economic
benefits will accrue to the Company and the cost of the asset can be reliably estimated.

**Leasing**

The Group applies IAS 17 Leases. Leasing is classified in the consolidated accounts as either finance or
operating leasing.

When a lease means that the Group, as lessee, essentially enjoys the economic benefits and bears the
economic risks attributable to the leased asset, it is classified as a finance lease. The leased asset is
recognised in the balance sheet as a fixed asset, while the estimated present value of future lease
payments is recognised as a liability. The portion of the lease fee that falls due for payment within one
year is recognised as a current liability, while the remainder is recognised as a long-term liability.
Minimum lease fees for finance leases are divided between interest expense and amortisation of the
outstanding liability. Interest expense is divided over the lease term so that each reporting period is
charged with an amount corresponding to a fixed interest rate for the liability recognised in each period.
Variable fees are expensed in the period in which they arise.

F-66


-----

**Note 1: Significant accounting and valuation principles (continued)**

In operating leasing, lease payments are expensed over the lease term. Payments are recognised in the
income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Benefits received in connection with the
signing of an operating lease are recognised as part of the total lease expense in the income statement.

**Taxes**

The Group applies IAS 12 Income Taxes.

Income taxes consist of current tax and deferred tax. Income taxes are recognised in the income
statement unless the underlying transaction is recognised directly in other total comprehensive income, in
which case the related tax effect is recognised in other total comprehensive income.

Current tax is tax that is to be paid or received during the year in question applying the tax rates applicable
on the balance sheet date; which includes adjustment of current tax attributable to previous periods.

Deferred tax is calculated according to the balance sheet method based on temporary differences
between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their value for tax purposes. The following
temporary differences are not taken into account: temporary differences that arise in the initial reporting of
goodwill, the initial reporting of assets and liabilities in a transaction other than a business combination
and which, at the time of the transaction, do not affect either the recognised or taxable result, or temporary
differences attributable to participations in subsidiaries and associated companies that are not expected
to be reversed within the foreseeable future. The valuation of deferred tax is based on how the carrying
values of assets or liabilities are expected to be realised or settled. Deferred tax is calculated by applying
the tax rates and tax rules that have been set or essentially are set as of the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax assets from deductible temporary differences and tax-loss carry forwards are only
recognised if it is likely they will be utilised within the foreseeable future. The value of deferred tax assets
is reduced when it is no longer considered likely they can be utilised.

**Shareholders’ equity**

Share repurchases and transaction expenses are recognised directly against equity. Dividends are
recognised as a liability after they are approved by the Annual General Meeting.

**Provisions**

The Group applies IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.

A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or informal obligation owing to
an event that has occurred and it is likely that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle
the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. The carrying amount for the provision is
based on an assessment of the most likely outcome, and can be calculated by weighing the various
possible outcomes and multiplying this by their estimated probability. Where it is important when in time
payment will be made, provisions are estimated by discounting the forecast future cash flow at a pre-tax
interest rate that reflects current market estimates of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the
risks associated with the liability.

A provision for restructuring is recognised when a detailed, formal restructuring plan has been
established and the restructuring has either begun or been publicly announced. No provision is made for
future operating expenses.

A provision for termination costs is recognised only if the persons in question have known or presumed to
have expected to be terminated by the balance sheet date.

A provision is recognised for a loss-making contract when anticipated benefits that the Group expects to
receive from a contract are less than the unavoidable costs to fulfil the obligations as set out in the
contract.

A provision for dilapidation agreements on leased premises is recognised if there is a contractual
obligation to the landlord, within the foreseeable future, to restore the premises to a certain condition
when the lease expires.

F-67


-----

**Note 1: Significant accounting and valuation principles (continued)**

**Unidentified receipts and excess payments**

The Group receives large volumes of payments from customers for itself and its clients. There are
instances where the sender’s reference information is missing or incorrect, which makes it difficult to
allocate the payment to the right case. There are also situations where payments are received on closed
cases. In such instances a reasonable search and attempt is made to contact the payment sender but,
failing this, the payment is recognised as income after a certain interval. A provision is recognised in the
balance sheet corresponding to the anticipated repayments of incorrectly received payments on a
probability analysis.

**Contingent liabilities**

A contingent liability is recognised when there is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose
existence will be confirmed only by one or more uncertain future events or when there is an obligation that
is not recognised as a liability or provision because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be
required.

**Impairment**

The Group applies IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.

The carrying value of the Group’s assets, with certain exceptions, is tested on each balance sheet date for
any indication of impairment. IAS 36 is applied in the impairment testing of all assets except financial
assets, which are valued in accordance with IAS 9, investment assets for pension liabilities, which are
valued in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits, and tax assets, which are valued in accordance
with IAS 12 Income Taxes.

If there is any indication of impairment, the asset’s recoverable value is estimated. For goodwill and other
intangible assets with an indeterminate useful life and intangible assets not yet brought into use,
recoverable values are calculated annually. If essentially independent cash flows cannot be isolated for
individual assets, the assets are grouped at the lowest level where essentially independent cash flows
can be identified, i.e., a cash-generating unit. Intrum’s operations in each geographical region are
considered to be the Group’s cash-generating units in this regard.

Impairment is recognised when the carrying value of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its
recoverable value. Impairment is recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses attributable to a
cash-generating unit are mainly allocated to goodwill, after which they are divided proportionately among
other assets in the unit.

The recoverable amount of cash-generating units is the higher of their fair value less costs to sell and
value in use. Value in use is measured by discounting future cash flows using a discounting factor that
takes into account the risk-free rate of interest and the risk associated with the specific asset.

Impairment of goodwill is not reversed. Impairment of other assets is reversed if a change has been made
in the assumptions that served as the basis for determining the recoverable amount. Impairment is
reversed only to the extent the carrying value of the assets following the reversal does not exceed the
carrying value that the asset would have had if the impairment had not been recognised

**Employee benefits**

The Group applies IAS 19 Employee Benefits.

_Pension obligations_

The Group’s pension obligations are, for the most part, secured through official pension arrangements or
insurance solutions. Pension obligations vary between countries on the basis of legislation and different
pension systems. See also Note 21 for a further description.

Defined contribution pension plans are plans where the Company’s obligation is limited to the fees it has
committed to pay. The size of the employee’s pension depends in part on the fees the Company pays to
an insurance company and in part on the return generated and actuarial factors. Consequently, it is the
employee who assumes the investment risk and actuarial risk. The Company’s obligations for defined

F-68


-----

**Note 1: Significant accounting and valuation principles (continued)**

contribution pension plans are expensed through the income statement as they are vested by employees
who render services on behalf of the Company.

For defined benefit pension plans, the pension obligation does not cease until the agreed pensions have
been paid. The Group’s net obligation for defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each
plan by estimating future compensation the employees has earned in current and previous periods; this
compensation is discounted to its present value. The discount rate is the interest rate as per the balance
sheet date on high-quality corporate bonds, including covered bonds, with a maturity that, if possible,
corresponds to the Group’s pension obligations. The calculation is performed by an actuary using the
so-called Projected Unit Credit Method. The fair value of Intrum’s share of any investment assets as of the
balance sheet date is calculated as well. Actuarial gains and losses may arise in the determination of the
present value of the obligation and the fair value of investment assets. They arise either because the
actual outcome deviates from previous assumptions or the assumptions change. All changes in value
associated with such changes in assumptions are recognised in other comprehensive income.

The balance sheet value of pensions and similar obligations is therefore equivalent to the present value
on the balance sheet date less the fair value of assets under management.

Pension costs for service in the current period are reported in the operating earnings, while the calculated
interest expense on the pension liability and the interest income from assets under management are
reported in net financial items.

Pension obligations in Sweden that are met through pension insurance premiums to Alecta in the
so-called ITP 2 plan are reported as defined contribution pension solutions.

**Borrowing costs**

The Group applies IAS 23 Borrowing Costs and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments.

Expenses incurred to secure bank financing are amortised across the term of the loan as financial
expenses in the consolidated income statement by using the effective interest method. The amount is
recognised in the balance sheet as a deduction to the loan liability.

The Group capitalises borrowing costs in the cost of qualifying assets, that is, fixed assets for substantial
amounts with long periods of completion. No such investments were initiated in 2017 or 2018.

**Revenue recognition**

The Group applies IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

Revenue, consisting of commissions and collection fees, is recognised on collection of the claim.
Subscription revenue is recognised proportionately over the term of the underlying service contracts,
which is usually one year. Revenue from other services is reported when the service has been performed.
Revenues from selling real estate are recognised when control of the property is transferred to the buyer.

**Financial income and expenses**

Financial income and expenses consist of interest income on bank balances and receivables and
interest-bearing securities, bank fees, interest expenses on loans, dividend income, exchange rate
differences, realised and unrealised gains on financial investments, and derivatives used in financial
operations.

**Payment guarantees**

Intrum offers some of the Group’s clients the opportunity, against payment, to obtain a guarantee from
Intrum regarding the clients’ receivables from their customers. The guarantee entails an undertaking by
Intrum to acquire the receivable from the creditor at its nominal value, or a certain part thereof, once it has
fallen overdue for payment by a certain number of days. The income, in the form of a guarantee fee, is
recognised when the guarantees are issued, while a liability is recognised in the balance sheet for
expected losses related to those guarantees. If the customers fails to make payment, Intrum acquires the
claim. The disbursement is then recognised as an acquisition of a receivable, less the liability recognised
when the guarantee was issued.

F-69


-----

**Note 1: Significant accounting and valuation principles (continued)**

**Cash flow statement**

The Group applies IAS 7 Cash Flow Statements.

The cash flow statement includes changes in the balance of liquid assets. The Group’s liquid assets
consist of cash and bank balances. Cash flow is divided into cash flows from operating activities,
investing activities and financing activities.

Cash flow from investing activities includes only actual disbursements for investments during the year.
Disbursements for the purchase of portfolios of overdue receivables are reported under cash flow from
investing activities, while the collection and repayment of such portfolios are reported under cash flow
from operating activities.

Foreign subsidiaries’ transactions are translated in the cash flow statement at the average exchange rate
for the period. Acquired and divested subsidiaries are recognised as cash flow from investing activities,
net, after deducting liquid assets in the acquired or divested company.

**Earnings per share**

The Group applies IAS 33 Earnings per Share.

Earnings per share consist of net earnings for the year (attributable to the Parent Company’s
shareholders) divided by a weighted average number of outstanding shares during the year. In this
context, treasury holdings of repurchased shares are not included in outstanding shares.

**Segments**

The Group applies IFRS 8 Operating Segments.

An operating segment is a part of the Group from which it can generate income and incur expenses and
for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating
decision maker, i.e. the CEO in deciding how to assess performance and allocate resources to the
operating segment.

Intrum’s operating segments are the geographical regions of Northern Europe (Denmark, Estonia, Latvia,
Lithuania, Finland, Norway and Sweden), Central and Eastern Europe (Greece, Poland, Romania,
Switzerland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary and Austria), Western and Southern
Europe (Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK), as well as the Iberian Peninsula
and Latin America (Spain, Portugal and Brazil). Central and joint expenses are spread across the
geographical regions in proportion to their purchasing power parity-adjusted revenues. The break-down
by geographical region is also used for internal monitoring in the Group.

In 2018, the composition of the Group’s operating segments, the geographic regions, was changed. The
change entailed operations in Spain, Portugal and Brazil being reported in the Iberian Peninsula and Latin
America region. Accordingly, the operations in Portugal are no longer included in the Western and
Southern Europe region. The comparison figures for 2017 have been recalculated in accordance with the
new region structure.

Among other things, Note 2 details net revenue and operating earnings by geographic region. However,
interest income, interest expenses, assets and liabilities are not reported by segment. This is not
considered relevant because the distribution of financial items and parts of the balance sheet is
dependent on Group structure and financing, which are not affected by the actual performance of the
regions. Nor are actual reported interest income, interest expenses, assets and liabilities by segment
included in any internal reporting to the CEO.

**Parent Company’s accounting principles**

The Parent Company has prepared the Annual Report according to the Annual Accounts Act (1995:1554)
and recommendation RFR 2 Accounting for Legal Entities from the Swedish Financial Reporting Board.
RFR 2 means that the Parent Company, in the Annual Report for the legal entity, must apply all
EU-approved IFRS and statements as far as possible within the framework of the Annual Accounts Act

F-70


-----

**Note 1: Significant accounting and valuation principles (continued)**

and taking into account the connection between reporting and taxation. The recommendation specifies
exemptions and additions relative to IFRS.

_Differences between the Group’s and Parent Company’s accounting principles_

The differences between the Group’s and Parent Company’s accounting principles are indicated below.
The accounting principles for the Parent Company as stated below have been applied consistently to all
periods presented in the Parent Company’s financial statements.

_Subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures_

Shares in subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures are recognised by the Parent Company
at cost, including transaction costs less any impairment. Only dividends received are recognised as
income. Credit risks in the Parent company’s receivables against intercompany counterparts have been
assessed, with the conclusion being that there is no significant impairment.

_Group contributions and shareholders’ contributions for legal entities_

The Company reports Group contributions and shareholders’ contributions in accordance with statement
RFR 2 of the Swedish Financial Reporting Board.

Group contributions received are recognised as dividends and Group contributions paid are recognised
as shareholders’ contributions. Shareholders’ contributions are recognised directly in the shareholders’
equity of the recipient and capitalised in the shares and participating interests of the contributor, to the
extent impairment is not required.

_A further goal is to reduce the proportion of fixed costs._

The Parent Company has no leases classified as finance leases in its own accounts or the consolidated
accounts.

No individual client is responsible for generating more than 4 percent of total consolidated revenue.

The distribution of revenues and earnings by geographical region is based on where clients are located.

The geographical regions are Northern Europe (Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Norway
and Sweden), Central and Eastern Europe (Greece, Poland, Romania, Switzerland, Slovakia, the Czech
Republic, Germany, Hungary and Austria), Western and Southern Europe (Belgium, France, Ireland,
Italy, the Netherlands and the UK), as well as the Iberian Peninsula and Latin America (Spain, Portugal
and Brazil). Central and joint expenses are spread across the geographical regions in proportion to their
purchasing power parity-adjusted revenues. The break-down by geographical region is also used for
internal monitoring in the Group.

Intra-Group sales between the regions are made on commercial terms. Internal transactions between the
business areas Financial Services and Credit Management Services relate to payment on commercial
terms for work carried out within Credit Management regarding handling and collection on the Group’s
portfolio investments. Payment is made in the form of a commission that is recognised as a cost within
Financial Services, but which is eliminated in the Consolidated Income Statement.

Interest income and expenses are not reported by segment. This is not considered relevant because the
distribution of financial items is dependent on Group structure and financing and is not affected by the
actual performance of the regions. Nor are actual reported interest income and expenses by segment
included in any internal reporting to the CEO.

Income from customers refers mainly to the Group’s collection operations, and is specified above by type
of income and in Note 2 by geographical region. Intrum’s income from the collection operations consists
mainly of fees and commissions that are recognised as income when the service (performance
obligation) has been confirmed as completed with the collection case having been paid. This means that
no significant contractual liabilities or contractual assets are recognised beyond accounts receivable and
accrued income as stated on separate lines in the balance sheet. Intrum can be paid for the services it
renders, either more or less immediately, through fees and commission being deducted from the amounts
collected and deposited in the client funds account, or on invoicing the client on payment terms customary
in each market, for example 30 days.

The price of the collection service can be set as a fixed fee per case, a percentage of the amount collected
or a combination of the two. For certain clients and in certain markets, fixed fees are charged instead in
accordance with the price list for specific collection measures in administrating the client case with the
enforcement service or in court. Some clients also pay an annual fees for the right to use Intrum’s services
(subscriptions), usually through advance payments that are allocated over the subscription term.

All interest income is attributable to items that are not carried at fair value in the income statement.

Operating earnings in accordance with the effective interest rate method include interest income
attributable to portfolio investments amounting to SEK 6,114 M (4,394), defined as the difference
between the year’s collected amount and amortisation for the year.

Amortisation comprises the portion of the cost of the portfolio that, owing to allocation under the effective
interest method, accrues over the current year.

In addition, a tax expense of SEK 5 M (41) from divested operations is also recognised. No tax is
recognised in respect of capital gains.

The Group has operations in more than 20 countries in Europe, with varying tax rates. The current tax
expense for the year relates mainly to income taxes in Switzerland, Finland, France, Italy, Belgium,
Portugal, Spain, the Czech Republic, Germany and Hungary. The Group’s Swedish companies paid no
income tax for the relevant year as they were able to utilise tax-loss carry forwards from historic losses, as
well as from the loss for the year attributable to interest expenses and exchange rate losses. Intrum AB is
domiciled in Sweden where the nominal corporate tax rate in 2017 and 2018 was 22 percent. The
following reconciliation explains the difference between the Group’s actual tax cost and the expected tax
cost taking the Swedish corporate tax rate into account:

**Note 8: Taxes (continued)**

Unrecognised tax assets regarding tax-loss carry forwards relate to the negative tax effect during the year
attributable to losses in countries where no deferred tax asset is recognised because it is not probable
that enough taxable profit will arise within the foreseeable future. Utilised previously unrecognised tax
assets pertaining to tax-loss carry forwards relate to the positive tax effect over the year arising through
the utilisation of tax-loss carry forwards never previously recognised as deferred tax assets.

When differences arise between the tax value and carrying value of assets and liabilities, a deferred tax
asset or tax liability is recognised. Such temporary differences mainly arise for portfolio investments,
provisions for pensions and intangible assets. Deferred tax assets include the value of tax-loss carry
forwards in the instances where they are likely to be utilised to offset taxable surpluses within the
foreseeable future.

The deferred tax assets and income tax liabilities are expected to be due for payment in over one year.

Deferred tax assets are reported in the balance sheet, when it is expected to be possible to offset the loss
carry forwards against taxable profits within the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognised on a net basis if they refer to the same tax authority or are planned to be used simultaneously.

The Group has tax-loss carry forwards that can be utilised against future earnings totalling SEK 6,293 M
(6,215).

On 31 December 2018, deferred tax assets regarding tax-loss carry-forwards amounted to SEK 935 M
and included SEK 453 M in Sweden, SEK 231 M in Norway, SEK 105 M in Germany and SEK 74 M in
Spain. The utilisation of tax-loss carry forwards is limited in time in Poland, where there were tax-loss
carry-forwards for SEK 74 M (47) and in Slovakia, where there were tax-loss carry forwards for SEK 4 M
(3). In Poland, the tax-loss carry-forwards may only be utilised during a period of five years from the year
in which the loss was incurred and, in Slovakia, they may only be utilised during a period of four years. For
Poland, deferred tax assets are recognised in the amount of SEK 4 M and, for Slovakia, in the amount of
SEK 1 M.

Tax-loss carry forwards for which no deferred tax assets are recognised pertain mainly to Sweden with
SEK 1,541 M (1,484) and the UK with SEK 501 M (337). As a consequence of the costs for the head office
expenses and financing costs, the Parent Company has for several years incurred a tax deficit, even
when taking in to account the group contributions received from the profitable companies conducting
business in Sweden. It is Intrum assessment that tax-loss carry forwards cannot be fully utilised against
positive taxable income in the foreseeable future without first restructuring the Group internally so that, for
example, the Parent Company’s interest expenses are transferred to foreign subsidiaries. If such
restructuring is implemented, it may be relevant to evaluate the tax-loss carry forwards in the accounts.
Loss carry forwards in Sweden may also be consumed through so-called CFC taxation on the earnings of
foreign subsidiaries with revenues subject to low tax rates.

Tax expenses recognised in other comprehensive income over the year amounted to SEK 79 M (15) of
which SEK 81 M refers to currency hedges and SEK�2 M refers to remeasurements of pension

Tax-free income and non-deductible expenses in the Parent Company consist largely of dividends from
subsidiaries, as well as gains on disposals of shares and, for 2017, non-deductible transaction expenses
in connection with the merger with Lindorff. At the end of the year, the Parent Company had accumulated
loss carry forwards of SEK 68 M (1,357). To the extent that it is expected to be possible to utilise them
against future taxable earnings, deferred tax assets are reported for these loss carry forwards in the
amount of SEK 8 M (199).

**Note 10: Intangible fixed assets (continued)**

Payments during the year regarding investments in intangible fixed assets amounted to SEK 232 M
(116) for the Group.

Capitalised expenditure for IT development is mainly generated internally using our own employees
and/or contracted consultants. Client relations and goodwill are acquired primarily in connection with
business acquisitions. Other intangible fixed assets are mainly acquired externally.

**Impairment testing for cash-generating units containing goodwill**

The Group treats the following geographical regions as cash-generating units in the sense referred to in
IAS 38 Intangible Assets. The goodwill value is distributed among each group of countries as follows.

**SEK M** **2018** **2017**

Northern Europe . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12,223 11,870

Impairment testing of goodwill for each cash-generating unit was done prior to preparation of the annual
accounts. The recoverable amount is determined through an estimation of its value in use. For each
cash-generating unit, management has compiled a projection of annual future cash flows based on
historical experience and the Company’s own plans and estimates for the future. The calculation is based
on a detailed forecast for the years 2019-2020 and thereafter an annual increase of 1 percent. The cash
flows have been discounted to present value applying the Group’s weighted average cost of capital,
which is estimated at 6.2 percent (5.1) before tax, corresponding to 4.8 percent (4.0) per year after tax.
The recoverable amount has been compared for each unit with the Group’s net book value of the unit’s
assets and liabilities. The test gave no indication of a need of goodwill impairment.

Impairment testing is based on a number of assumptions, where the outcome is judged to be most
sensitive to some of those assumptions in particular:

For 2019, annual revenue growth of 4 percent (4) is assumed, and for 2020, 4 percent (2), with each
SEK 1,000 in increased revenue being assumed to result in an increase in working capital of SEK 250
(250), that is, an ‘‘incremental increase in earnings’’ of 25 percent (25). For the period after 2020,
perpetual growth in cash flow of 1 percent (1) annually is assumed. The same assumptions were applied
for all four geographical regions. The same discount rates were also applied, since no long-term
difference can be identified between the regions’ growth potential or risk.

**Sensitivity analysis**

A sensitivity analysis has been performed, in which cash flows have been discounted at 6 percent interest
after tax. Applying this assumption, impairment of SEK 2.4 billion would need to be recognised in goodwill
attributable to the Iberian Peninsula and Latin America region.

In the Netherlands, a VAT receivable arises in connection with portfolio investments. The VAT portion of
the acquired receivable can be recovered from the tax authorities if it is not collected from the customers
and is therefore recognised as a separate receivable. The portion that is expected to be recovered within
12 months is recognised as current.

In the Netherlands, bailiffs are private companies and expenses for collection cases paid to them can
sometimes be recovered from the bailiffs if their collection measures fail. When it emerges that Intrum is
entitled to request that the amount be returned from the enforcement authorities, the amount is moved
from Outlays on behalf of clients, to To recover from enforcement authorities.

**Note 20: Shareholders’ equity**

**Share capital**

According to the Articles of Association of Intrum AB (publ), the company’s share capital will amount to
not less than SEK 1,300,000 and not more than SEK 5,200,000. All shares are fully paid in, carry equal
voting rights and share equally in the Company’s assets and earnings. No shares are reserved for
transfer.

There are 131,541,320 shares in the Company, and the share capital amounts to SEK 2,899,805.49. See
below regarding repurchased shares.

**New share issue**

On 27 June 2017, Intrum Justitia AB merged with Lindorff and completed a non-cash issue, whereby
Intrum Justitia AB issued 59,193,594 new Intrum Justitia shares, in exchange for all shares in Lock
TopCo AS, which was the parent company of the Lindorff Group. Accordingly, there are 131,541,320
shares outstanding in Intrum.

**Share repurchase**

No shares were repurchased in 2017. In 2018, 250,000 shares were repurchased for SEK 56 M.
Accordingly, there were 131,291,320 shares outstanding in Intrum at the beginning of 2018. The average
number of shares outstanding over the year was 131,390,632 (102,674,307).

**Other shareholders’ equity in the Group**

_Other paid-in capital_

Refers to equity other than share capital contributed by the owners or arising owing to the Group’s
shared-based payment programmes. Also included are share premiums paid in connection with new
issues.

_Reserves_

Includes the translation reserve, which contains all exchange rate differences that have, since the
transition to IFRS in 2004, arisen in the translation of financial statements from foreign operations as well
as long-term intra-Group receivables and liabilities that represent an increase or decrease in the Group’s

**Note 20: Shareholders’ equity (continued)**

net investment in the foreign operations. The amount also includes exchange rate differences arising in
the Parent Company’s external loans in foreign currency, which are intended to hedge the Group’s
translation exposure attributable to net assets in foreign subsidiaries.

_Retained earnings including net earnings for the year_

Refer to earnings in the Parent Company and subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated companies.
Provisions to the statutory reserve, excluding transferred share premium reserves, were previously
included in this item. Accumulated revaluations of the Group’s defined benefit pension provisions are also
included. Dividends paid and share repurchases are deducted from the amount.

Following the balance sheet date, the Board of Directors proposed a dividend of SEK 9.50 per share
(9.50), or a total estimated payout of SEK 1,247 M (1,250).

**Other shareholders’ equity in the Parent Company**

_Statutory reserve_

Refers to provisions to the statutory reserve and share premium reserve prior to 2006. The statutory
reserve is restricted equity and may not be reduced through distributions of earnings.

_Share premium reserve_

When shares are issued at a premium, the amount exceeding their quota value is transferred to the share
premium reserve. Provisions to the share premium reserve as of 2006 are non-restricted equity.

_Fair value reserve_

Refers to unrealised exchange rate gains or losses on external loans in foreign currency, which are
intended to hedge the Group’s translation exposure attributable to net assets in foreign subsidiaries. The
fair value reserve is non-restricted equity.

_Earnings brought forward_

Refer to retained earnings from the previous year less the dividend paid and share repurchases. Retained
earnings are non-restricted equity.

_Capital structure_

The Company’s definition of capital corresponds to shareholders’ equity including holdings without a
controlling interest, which at year-end totalled SEK 25,672 M (22,439).

The measure of the Company’s capital structure used for control purposes is consolidated net debt in
relation to pro forma rolling 12-month-adjusted cash EBITDA, which at year-end amounted to 4.3 (4.1).
This ratio is calculated by placing current consolidated net debt at the end of the year in relation to pro
forma cash EBITDA, including operations being phased out and including a calculated cash EBITDA
throughout the period for larger units acquired during the year, and excluding non-recurring items (NRIs).
Net debt is defined as the sum of interest-bearing liabilities and pension provisions less liquid funds and
interest-bearing receivables.

The Board of Directors has established financial targets for the Group, in which net debt divided by pro
forma rolling 12-month-adjusted cash EBITDA, as stated above, shall be between 2.5 and 3.5 in the long
term.

**Note 21: Pensions**

Employees in Intrum’s companies are covered by various pension benefits, some of which are defined
benefit plans and others as defined contribution plans. The Group applies IAS 19 Employee Benefits,
which contains, among other things, uniform regulations on the actuarial calculation of provisions for
pensions in defined benefit plans.

F-92


-----

**Note 21: Pensions (continued)**

Group employees in Switzerland, and certain employees in Germany, are covered by pension plans
funded through assets under the management of insurance companies and are reported as defined
benefit pension plans. Other employees in Germany and employees in Norway and Italy are covered by
unfunded defined benefit pension plans that can be paid out as a one-time sum or as monthly payments
following retirement. In France, the Company makes provisions for one-time payments made to
employees on retirement, and these provisions are also reported according to the rules for defined benefit
pension plans. In Belgium and Sweden, there are pension plans, funded through insurance, which
theoretically should have been reported as defined benefit plans, but which are recognised as defined
contribution plans since the Company lacks sufficient data to report them as defined benefit plans. See
also below regarding the ITP 2 plan.

Among other things, IAS 19 requires pension costs for service in the current period to be reported in the
operating earnings, while the calculated interest expense on the pension liability and the interest income
from assets under management are reported in net financial items. Actuarial revaluations are recognised
in other comprehensive income.

Provisions for pensions reported in the balance sheet can be analysed as follows:

Costs for employment in the current period are reported in operating earnings. Net interest income/
expense is reported under net financial items. Revaluations of the pension liability are included in other
comprehensive income in the amount of SEK 8 M (negative 18) before tax. In calculating

Provisions for pensions, the following assumptions are used:

The Group also finances a number of defined contribution plans, Consolidated expenses for these
amounted to SEK 146 M (108).

**Funded defined benefit pension plans**

For Group employees in Switzerland, commitments exist in the form of obligatory service pension plans
funded through insurance policies in the Swiss Life Collective BVG Foundation and in Transparenta BVG
Foundation. The funded commitments currently amount to SEK 307 M (273), and the fair value of the
assets under management is SEK 237 M (206). Consequently, the net pension liability is SEK 70 M (67).
The pension commitment is funded through insurance contracts. During the year Intrum paid SEK 42 M
(40) to the plan, while disbursements to retirees amounted to SEK 43 M (22). In 2019 payments to the
plan are estimated at SEK 42 M, with disbursements to retirees of SEK 43 M. For these pension plans, a
discount rate of 0.85 percent is applied. An increase/decrease in the discount rate by 0.5 percentage
points would entail the pension liability decreasing by 7.7 percent/increasing by 8.9 percent.

For Group employees in Norway, mandatory occupational pensions commitments exist that were
previously secured through a funded defined benefit pension solution, although these were replaced in
2019 by an unfunded defined benefit solution and a defined contribution solution.

**ITP 2 plan**

The commitments for retirement and family pensions for the Group’s Swedish employees are secured
through insurance with Alecta according to the so-called ITP 1 and ITP 2 plans. ITP 1 includes employees
born in 1979 or later, while ITP 2 covers employees born in 1978 or earlier. ITP 1 is a defined contribution
plan. On the other hand, according to a statement from the Swedish Financial Reporting Board, UFR 10,
the ITP 2 plan is a multi-employer defined benefit plan. Alecta’s customers have not had access to such
information for the fiscal year that would make allow them to report their proportional share of plan assets,
liabilities and costs, preventing it from being possible to report the plan as a defined benefit plan. Nor is
there a contractual agreement how surpluses and deficits in the plan are to be distributed among plan
participants. The ITP 2 plan secured through insurance with Alecta is therefore reported by Intrum as if it
were a defined contribution plan. The premium is individually calculated, depending on salary, previously
vested pension and anticipated remaining term of employment. At year-end Alecta’s surplus in the form of
the collective funding ratio was 142 percent (154). The collective funding ratio consists of the market
value of Alecta’s assets as a percentage of the insurance obligations calculated according to Alecta’s
actuarial assumptions, which do not conform to IAS 19. Under the provisions of the ITP 2 plan, measures
must be taken if the funding ratio falls below 125 percent (for example, in connection with an increase in

Since June 2017, Intrum AB has had a four and a half year revolving syndicated loan facility totalling
EUR 1,100 M with a bank consortium consisting of five Nordic banks. The loan framework of
EUR 1,100 M can be utilised for borrowing in a number of different currencies. On 31 December 2018, the
loan framework had been utilised for loans in SEK totalling SEK 0 M (700), in EUR totalling
EUR 295 M (100), in GBP totalling GBP 102 M (0), in NOK totalling NOK 3,000 M (0) and in HUF totalling
HUF 16,200 M (0). The unutilised portion of the facilities amounted to SEK 4,241 M (8,008). The loan
carries a variable interest rate based on the interbank rate in each currency, with a margin. The loan
facility contains operations-related and financial covenants, including limits on financial indicators. All of
these covenants were fully met in 2018. In addition, the credit agreement includes covenants that may
restrict, condition or prohibit the Group from incurring additional debt, making acquisitions, disposing of

assets, making capital and finance lease expenditures, allowing assets to be encumbered, changing the
scope of the Group’s business and entering into a merger agreement.

During 2017, Intrum AB issued public bonds for approximately EUR 3,000 M, divided into four tranches of
a total EUR 2,700 M and SEK 3,000 M. During 2018, Intrum issued an additional public bond for
SEK 1,000 M, and thus has bond loans outstanding for a total SEK 34,254 M (33,052). In 2018, Intrum
also issued a commercial paper that, at the end of the year, amounted to SEK 2,123 M (2,269).

Pledged collateral includes deposits and restricted bank balances that can be claimed by clients,
suppliers or authorities in the event that Intrum were not to meet its contractual obligations.

**Note 25: Pledged assets, contingent assets and contingent liabilities (continued)**

Pledged collateral also includes shares in subsidiaries within the Group pledged as collateral for the
Parent Company’s revolving credit facility. The reported value of pledged collateral in the table above
refers to the consolidated value of the subsidiaries’ net assets.

**Payment guarantees**

The Group offers services whereby clients, against payment, obtain a guarantee from Intrum regarding
the clients’ receivables from their customers. This entails a risk being incurred that Intrum must
compensate the client for the guaranteed amount in the event that the invoices are not paid on time. In
those cases where the guarantee comes into play, Intrum assumes the client’s claim against its customer
and takes over the continued handling of the case within the Portfolio Investments area of operations. At
the end of the year, the total amount guaranteed was SEK 120 M (111). Intrum’s risk in this business is
managed through strict credit limits and analyses of the borrower’s credit status. As of year-end Intrum
had allocated SEK 1 M (1) in the balance sheet to cover payments that may arise due to the guarantee.

**Other**

In 2012, when Intrum acquired the Dutch company Buckaroo BV, a supplementary purchase
consideration to the sellers was agreed that would be based on the results achieved by the Company
during the period 2012–2014. Only part of the supplementary purchase consideration has been paid. In
2015, the sellers initiated legal proceedings, bringing claims against Intrum and some of its executives,
demanding payment of additional purchase consideration. These demands are motivated by claims that
the actions of Intrum (and its executives) caused a worse result in Buckaroo than expected, and thus a
lower supplementary purchase consideration. Although Intrum divested the shares in Buckaroo in 2017,
the claim on Intrum from the previous owners remains. Intrum refutes all of these demands and has not
made any provisions with regard to these disputes.

In Spain, a number of disputes are in progress in both higher and lower level courts against two former
executives, attributable to their termination in June 2015. The disputes concern whether the dismissals
were unlawful, the former executives’ entitlement to different bonuses and the entitlement to
compensation for one of the former executives for a competition commitment in his employment contract.
Although Intrum won in the court of first instance in 2018, the counterparties have appealed. Intrum
refutes all of these claims. The potential impact on consolidated earnings is not considered to be material.

In Poland, a dispute is in progress related to the acquisition of Casus Finanse S.A. in 2015. The dispute
concerns the entitlement of the sellers, the former management of Casus Finanse SA, to an additional
purchase consideration and remuneration for continued employment under the share transfer
agreement. The former management of Casus Finanse SA was dismissed in December 2016, and
Intrum’s position is that no entitlement to an additional purchase consideration nor remuneration for
continued employment applies. The dispute has been referred to an arbitration board, which requested
an expert opinion in 2018 and is expected to announce its ruling in the spring of 2019. Intrum Justitia has
made a provision for the dispute in accordance with the anticipated outcome.

The Group is otherwise involved in disputes in the normal course of business. In the opinion of the Board,
none of these disputes are expected to give rise to any significant cost.

Salaries and other remuneration in the Group also include remuneration in forms other than cash
payments, such as a free or subsidised car, housing and meals. Parent Company figures refer strictly to
cash payments, however. For information on compensation to the Group’s senior executives, see
Note 28.

**Note 28: Terms of employment for senior executives**

**Guidelines on compensation for senior executives**

The 2018 Annual General Meeting adopted guidelines for remuneration to senior executives, the CEO
and members of Group Management. The proposal has been prepared by the Board and its
Remuneration Committee.

_Salary and remuneration philosophy_

Intrum Justitia is dependent on its employees to achieve ambitious objectives in a challenging
environment. The salary and remuneration philosophy seeks to ensure our employees are rewarded for
their valuable contributions to the company’s earnings. We also strive to be able to recruit, develop and
retain high-performance employees in a competitive international environment. At the same time, we try
to ensure that our employees are offered salaries in line with the market.

Remuneration levels should reflect duties, responsibility and performance, and should be competitive
compared with similar companies in similar sectors in the same geographic area. To ensure that
appropriate behaviours are encouraged, and that efforts are focused in the appropriate areas,
remuneration levels need to be related to the objectives closely associated with the Group’s business
strategy and its core values.

The total remuneration is based on three principal components: fixed salary, incentive programmes and
pension benefits. Other benefits, such as a company car, may be offered as well.

Fixed salary is set based on three perspectives: The complexity and responsibility of the post, individual
performance and local market conditions.

_Variable salary component_

Intrum’s variable salary component primarily rewards financial business targets and serves to encourage
short-term performance. It is set for one year at a time. The metrics are set individually for each member
of Group Management to reflect the Group’s business strategy and priorities. The metrics reflect business
targets or other generation of value for the Company. Short-term variable salary means that the
Company’s expenses vary alongside the Group’s financial development and the employees’ individual
performance.

F-100


-----

**Note 28: Terms of employment for senior executives (continued)**

Short-term variable salary is capped at 50 percent of fixed annual salary for the CEO and at between 35
and 50 percent for other members of Group Management. However, the Chief Risk Officer does not
receive a variable salary component.

_Long-term incentives_

Through the long-term incentive programme, Group Management’s long-term interests and perspectives
are brought onto an equal footing with those of shareholders, while commitment to the company is also
reinforced. This encourages the long-term generation of value over a three-year period, allowing Group
Management to participate in the company’s financial success. Growth in Intrum Justitia’s earnings per
share is generally applied as a metric because this is considered a good indicator of the Group’s
long-term success. As with the variable salary component, an effect of the programme’s design is that the
cost varies alongside the Group’s financial performance.

It is proposed that long-term incentives be offered in the form of shares or share-related instruments. The
maximum initial allocation is 150 percent of fixed annual salary for the CEO, CFO and CIO and between
35 and 50 percent for other members of Group Management.

The outcome of long-term incentives is not pensionable.

_Costs_

For 2018, expenses for incentive programmes for the CEO and other members of Group Management
are expected to amount to at most SEK 18 M for the variable salary component and at most SEK 33 M for
the long-term incentive programme, excluding social security contributions. The estimate does not take
into account any changes in the composition of Group Management during the year.

_Guidelines for individual share ownership_

To further encourage commitment and behaviour as shareholders among Group Management,
expectations are expressed with regard to individual shareholdings representing a certain proportion of
annual fixed salary before tax—100 percent for the President and 50 percent for other members of Group
Management. Share ownership should persist as long as these individuals remain employees and
members of Group Management. . Each member of Group Management has (individually) been allocated
a period of time in which to accumulate shares if this target has yet to be met.

_Other_

In the event of termination by Intrum Justitia, a maximum of 12 months’ severance pay shall apply (if at
all).

The Board of Directors shall have the right to depart from these remuneration guidelines if there is
particular justification for doing so in individual cases.

**Role of the Remuneration Committee**

The Board of Directors has a Remuneration Committee whose task is to address the Group’s
remuneration issues on behalf of shareholders and the Board. The Remuneration Committee is
responsible for preparing the Group’s remuneration guidelines, which include general principles for how
salaries and other remunerations are determined, as well as addressing remuneration issues concerning
the CEO and Group Management. The Remuneration Committee comprises two Board members. Since
the 2017 Annual General Meeting, the Remuneration Committee has consisted of Per E. Larsson
(Chairman) and Fredrik Tr¨ag˚ardh. The CEO and the Company’s Chief Human Resources Officer are
co-opted to the Committee’s meetings, though not when their own remuneration is discussed.

**Terms of employment and remuneration of the CEO**

During 2018, Mikael Ericson, President and CEO, received remuneration in accordance with the Group’s
principles as detailed above. In 2018, his fixed monthly salary amounted to SEK 500,000. In addition to
his fixed salary, he had the opportunity to receive 50 percent of his annual salary within the framework of
the short-term remuneration programme and 50 percent of his annual salary within the framework of the

F-101


-----

**Note 28: Terms of employment for senior executives (continued)**

2016 long-term remuneration programme, in proportion to his period of employment. In 2018, he was
offered long-term incentives with an initial allocation of 150 percent of his fixed annual salary. In addition
to his salary, the Company paid pension contributions corresponding to 35 percent of his fixed annual
salary. The pension policy is a defined contribution plan and the retirement age is 65 years. He also had a
company car in accordance with the Group’s car policy, as well as subsidised meals under the same
terms as other Group employees in Sweden.

**Terms of employment and remuneration for other members of Group Management**

During 2018, other members of Group Management also had benefit levels in accordance with the
Group’s principles as detailed described above. This includes fixed annual salary and the opportunity to
receive 0–50 percent of annual salary within the framework of the short-term remuneration programme
and, for former members of Intrum Justitia’s Group Management, 20–50 percent within the framework of
the 2016 long-term remuneration programme. In 2018, they were offered long-term incentives with an
initial allocation of 35–150 percent of their fixed annual salary. Pension benefits vary from country to
country. In several cases, they are included in monthly salaries. Pension policies are defined contribution
plans, and the retirement age is generally 65. Members of Group Management have company cars, in
accordance with the Group’s car policy. Smaller benefits also occur according to local practice, such as
subsidised meals and travel.

In March 2017, certain senior executives, excluding the President and CEO, were offered an additional
bonus, amounting to two or three months’ salary, linked to the merger between Intrum Justitia and
Lindorff. With the predetermined terms having been met, the exceptional bonus was paid out in March
2018. Reported variable remuneration below includes the exceptional bonus, which was vested during
the period 22 March 2017 to 31 March 2018.

The notice of termination for members of Group Management Team varies from three to twelve months,
regardless of whether termination is initiated by the employee or the Company.

**Remuneration for the year**

Other senior executives in the table are defined as members of Group Management (see pages 112-114)
other than the CEO. In 2018, two individuals were appointed and three stepped down. During the period
from 12 February 2018 to 16 July 2018, Thomas Moss was acting CFO and thus a member of Group
Management. At the end of 2018, there were 12 other senior executives.

expensed by the Company in 2017 was disbursed in 2018, while the variable remuneration for 2018 is to
be disbursed in 2019.

No share-based remunerations were paid in 2017 or 2018.

**Board of Directors**

In accordance with the Annual General Meeting’s resolution, total fees paid to Board members for the
year, including for committee work, amounted to SEK 6,795 thousand (5,395). Board fees are distributed
between Directors as determined by the AGM according to the proposal by the Nomination Committee.
The Directors have no pension benefits or severance agreements.

The only financial instruments that are regularly restated at fair value are derivatives (e.g. forward
exchange contracts). They are valued based on a valuation technique that uses observable market data
and thus falls under Level 2 in the valuation hierarchy according to IFRS 13.

Financial assets include the balance sheet items: purchased debt, other long-term receivables, accounts
receivable, client funds, other current receivables, accrued income, derivatives with positive value, cash
and cash equivalents and, for the Parent Company, intra-Group receivables. The total recognised value
of consolidated financial assets amounted to SEK 30,109 M (25,212) on the balance sheet date. Financial
assets classified as loan receivables and accounts receivable in 2017 and at amortised cost in 2018
amounted to SEK 29,507 M (25,000) and financial assets recognised at fair value via the income
statement amounted to SEK 602 M (212).

The total recognised value of the Parent Company’s financial assets amounted to SEK 35,909 M (34,934)
on the balance sheet date. Financial assets classified as loan receivables and accounts receivable in
2017 and at amortised cost in 2018 amounted to SEK 35,880 M (34,722) and financial assets recognised
at fair value via the income statement amounted to SEK 229 M (212).

Financial liabilities include the balance sheet items: non-current and current liabilities to credit institutions,
bond loans, commercial papers, client funds payable, accounts payable, advances from clients, other
current liabilities, accrued expenses, prepaid income and, for the Parent Company, intra-Group liabilities.

The total recognised value of consolidated financial assets amounted to SEK 47,469 M (42,168) on the
balance sheet date. Financial liabilities recognised at amortised cost amounted to SEK 47,440 M (42,113)
and financial liabilities recognised at fair value amounted to SEK 29 M (55).

The total recognised value of the Parent Company’s financial liabilities amounted to SEK 50,573 M
(43,417) on the balance sheet date. Financial liabilities recognised at amortised cost amounted to
SEK 50,544 M (43,362) and financial liabilities recognised at fair value amounted to SEK 29 M (55).

**Note 33: Financial instruments (continued)**

_Portfolio investments_

Portfolio investments consist of purchased debt reported at amortised cost according applying an
effective interest rate model with an effective interest rate reflecting the risk of defaulted payment. The
Group determines the carrying value by calculating the present value of estimated future cash flows at the
receivables’ original effective interest rate. Adjustments are recognised in the income statement. With this
valuation method, the carrying value is the best estimate of the fair value of debt portfolios, in the
Company’s opinion. On the balance sheet date, the carrying value of purchased debt amounted to
SEK 24,830 M (21,149). An account of purchased debt by year acquired is provided in Note 34.

_Accounts receivable_

Accounts receivable are recognised at amortised cost with no discount being applied since the remaining
maturity is judged to be short. Accounts receivable amounted to SEK 719 M (755) on the balance sheet
date.

_Other receivables_

Other receivables have short maturities. Receivables in foreign currency are translated in the accounts at
balance sheet date rates. Consequently, carrying value corresponds to fair value. Other receivables,
including accrued income, amounted to SEK 3,211 M (2,427) on the balance sheet date. The item
includes forward exchange contracts for SEK 229 M (212), and receivables of SEK 373 M (0) recognised
at fair value in the income statement. The remaining SEK 2,982 M (2,215) is valued at amortised cost. For
the Parent Company, other receivables, including receivables from Group companies, amounted to
SEK 35,857 M (34,839). The item includes forward exchange contracts for SEK 229 M (212), recognised
at fair value in the income statement. The remaining SEK 35,628 M (34,627) is valued at amortised cost.

_Cash and cash equivalents_

Liquid assets mainly consist of bank balances. Liquid assets in foreign currency are translated in the
accounts at balance sheet date rates. Consequently, carrying value corresponds to fair value. On the
balance sheet date, cash and cash equivalents amounted to SEK 1,348 M (881). For the Parent
Company, the corresponding amount was SEK 251 M (95) on the balance sheet date.

_Liabilities to credit institutions_

The Parent Company’s and the Group’s loan liabilities carry market rate interest with short fixed interest
terms. Liabilities in foreign currency are translated in the accounts at balance sheet date rates.
Consequently, carrying value corresponds to fair value. On the balance sheet date, consolidated
liabilities to credit institutions amounted to SEK 6,831 M (2,703) and for the Parent Company, they
amounted to SEK 6,545 M (2,694).

_Bond loans_

The Parent Company and the Group had bond loans outstanding for a value of SEK 34,254 M (33,052) on
the balance sheet date. The bond loans are recognised at amortised cost. The fair value of the bonds, in
accordance with observable market data, is SEK 31,606 M (33,408).

_Commercial papers_

The Parent Company and the Group had commercial papers outstanding for a value of SEK 2,123 M
(2,269) on the balance sheet date.

_Accounts payable_

Accounts payable have short maturities. Liabilities in foreign currency are translated in the accounts at
balance sheet date rates. Consequently, carrying value corresponds to fair value. Consolidated accounts
payable amounted to SEK 488 M (572). For the Parent Company, the equivalent amount was SEK 33 M
(53).

**Note 33: Financial instruments (continued)**

_Other liabilities_

The Parent Company’s and the Group’s other liabilities have short maturities. Liabilities in foreign
currency are translated in the accounts at balance sheet date rates. Consequently, carrying value
corresponds to fair value. Other liabilities, including accrued expenses amounted to SEK 3,773 M (3,572)
on the balance sheet date. The item includes derivatives valued at SEK 29 M (55), recognised at fair
value in the income statement (held for trade). Other liabilities, excluding derivatives amounted to SEK
3,744 M (3,517).

For the Parent Company, other liabilities amounted to SEK 7,618 M (5,348) on the balance sheet date
and included liabilities to Group companies and accrued expenses. Derivatives are recognised at fair
value in the income statement (held for trade) and amounted to SEK 29 M (55). Other liabilities, excluding
derivatives amounted to SEK 7,589 M (5,293).

_Offset of financial instruments_

Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value comprise derivatives. Financial assets and liabilities
are not offset in the balance sheet. However, there are legally binding agreements that allow offsetting
should one of the counterparties for the Group’s derivatives suspend their payments. At the end of the
year, Intrum had financial assets totalling SEK 29 M (50) that could be offset against debts should the
counterparties suspend their payments.

**Note 34: Financial risks and financial policies**

**Principles of financing and financial risk management**

The financial risks that arise in Intrum operations are limited. Thanks to a strong cash flow, combined with
little need for investment and operating capital, external capital needs in the Group’s Credit Management
operations are relatively low. The purchased debt operations have a greater need for capital, particularly
during a growth phase.

Intrum’s financing and financial risks are managed within the Group in accordance with the treasury policy
established by the Board of Directors. The treasury policy contains rules for managing financial activities,
delegating responsibility, measuring and identifying financial risks and limiting these risks.

Internal and external financial operations are concentrated in Group Treasury in Stockholm and Oslo,
which ensures economies of scale when pricing financial transactions. Because Group Treasury can take
advantage of temporary surpluses and deficits in the Group’s various countries of operation, the Group’s
total interest expense can be minimised.

**Market risk**

Market risk consists of risks related to changes in exchange rates and interest rate levels.

_Exchange rate risk_

Exchange rate risk is the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates will negatively affect the Group’s income
statement, balance sheet and/or cash flows. The most important currencies for the Intrum Group, other
than the Swedish krona (SEK), are the euro (EUR), the Swiss franc (CHF), the Hungarian forint (HUF)
and the Norwegian krone (NOK).

The following exchange rates have been used to translate transactions in foreign currency in the financial
accounts:

**Average** **Average**

-----

**Note 34: Financial risks and financial policies (continued)**

Exchange rate risk can be divided into transaction exposure and translation exposure. Transaction
exposure consists of net operating and financial receipts and disbursements in different currencies.
Translation exposure consists of the effects from the translation of the financial reports of foreign
subsidiaries and associated companies to SEK.

_Transaction exposure_

In each country, all income and most operating expenses are denominated in local currencies, and thus
currency fluctuations have only a limited impact on the Company’s operating earnings in local currency.
National operations seldom have receivables and liabilities in foreign currency. Income and expenses in
national currency are thereby hedged in a natural way, which limits transaction exposure. The currency
exposure that arises within the operating activities is limited to the extent it pertains to international
collection operations. The subsidiaries’ projected flow exposure is not hedged at present. All major known
currency flows are hedged on a continuous basis in the Group and the Parent Company through forward
exchange contracts.

_Translation exposure_

Intrum operates in some 25 countries. The results and financial position of subsidiaries are reported in the
relevant foreign currencies and later translated into SEK for inclusion in the consolidated financial
statements. Consequently, fluctuations in the SEK exchange rate affect consolidated income and
earnings, as well as equity and other items in the financial statements.

The Group’s revenues are distributed by currency as follows:

**SEK M** **2018** **2017**

SEK . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 882 878

An appreciation of the Swedish krona of 10 percentage points on average in 2018 against EUR would
thus, all else being equal, have affected revenues negatively by SEK 779 M, against CHF by SEK 80 M,
against HUF by SEK 120 M and against NOK by SEK 159 M.

In terms of net assets by currency, shareholders’ equity in the Group, including non-controlling interests,

All else being equal, an appreciation in the Swedish krona of 37 percentage points as per 31 December
2018 against EUR would have affected shareholders’ equity in the Group negatively by SEK 1,097 M,
against CHF by SEK 59 M, against DKK by SEK 27 M, against HUF by SEK 93 M and against NOK by
SEK 37 M.

Regarding the currency risk attributable to currency interest rate swaps, see the description below under
Interest rate risks.

The Group hedges itself against part of the translation exposure through currency hedging via external
loans in foreign currency and derivatives. There is an economic relationship between the hedged balance
sheet items and the hedge instruments where the efficiency of the hedges is tested and adjusted on a
monthly basis. The effects of the translation exposure and the hedging arrangements have opposite signs
and are reported in Other comprehensive income.

Hedge instruments amounted to SEK�34,185 M (�32,012) at year-end. No inefficiency has been
reported during the year as regards hedges of net investments in foreign operations.

_Interest rate risks_

Interest rate risks relate primarily to the Group’s interest-bearing net debt, which amounted to
SEK 42,122 M (37,322) on 31 December 2018. The loan rate is tied to the market rate.

Intrum has a strong cash flow which gives the Group the option of repaying loans or investing in portfolios.
The Group’s loans have a fixed interest term—currently about 30 months (39) for the entire loan portfolio.
A 1-percent increase in market interest rates during the year would have adversely affected net financial
items by approximately SEK 397 M. A 5-percent increase would have adversely affected net financial
items by SEK 1,986 M.

To establish an appropriate matching of currencies in the balance sheet and thus manage the currency
risk between assets and liabilities, the Company uses currency interest rate swaps in which the Parent
Company swaps liabilities in SEK and receives EUR at the same rate on both the start and maturity dates.
In this way, the Company can maintain the desired level of hedging of shareholders’ equity per currency
while also maintaining an interest rate exposure in the same currency.

**Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk of a loss or higher-than-expected costs to ensure the Group’s ability to fulfil its
short and long-term payment obligations to outside parties.

F-108


-----

**Note 34: Financial risks and financial policies (continued)**

The Group’s long-term financing risk is limited by confirmed loan facilities. The Group’s objective is that at
least 35 percent of total committed loans have a remaining maturity of at least three years and that not
more than 35 percent of the total have a remaining maturity of less than 12 months.

Since June 2017, Intrum AB has had a four and a half year revolving syndicated loan facility totalling
EUR 1,100 M with a bank consortium consisting of five Nordic banks. The loan framework of EUR 1,100
M can be utilised for borrowing in a number of different currencies. On 31 December 2018, the loan
framework had been utilised for loans in SEK totalling SEK 0 M (700), in EUR totalling EUR 295 M (100),
in GBP totalling GBP 102 M (0), in NOK totalling NOK 3,000 M (0) and in HUF totalling HUF 16,200 M (0).

The unutilised portion of the facilities amounted to SEK 4,241 M (8,008). The loan carries a variable
interest rate based on the interbank rate in each currency, with a margin. The loan facility contains
operations-related and financial covenants, including limits on financial indicators. All of these covenants
were fully met in 2018. In addition, the credit agreement includes covenants that may restrict, condition or
prohibit the Group from incurring additional debt, making acquisitions, disposing of assets, making capital
and finance lease expenditures, allowing assets to be encumbered, changing the scope of the Group’s
business and entering into a merger agreement.

In 2017, Intrum AB issued public bonds for approximately EUR 3,000 M, divided into four tranches
totalling EUR 2,700 M and SEK 3,000 M. During 2018, Intrum issued an additional public bond for
SEK 1,000 M, and thus has total outstanding bond loans for SEK 34,254 M (33,052). In 2018, Intrum also
issued a commercial paper that, at the end of the year, amounted to SEK 2,123 M (2,269).

The Group’s aim is that the liquidity reserve, which consists of cash, bank balances and short-term liquid
investments should amount to at least SEK 100 M more than the unutilised portion of committed lines of
credit. The Group has deposited its liquid assets with established financial institutions where the risk of
loss is considered remote. The Group’s finance function prepares regular liquidity forecasts with the
purpose of optimising the balance between loans and liquid funds so that the net interest expense is
minimised without, for that matter, incurring difficulties in meeting external commitments.

The table below provides an analysis of the financial liabilities of the Group and the Parent Company
broken down according to the amount of time remaining until the contractual maturity date. The amounts
given in the table are the contractual, undiscounted cash flows including interest. The amounts falling due
within 12 months agree with the reported amounts since the discount effect is negligible.

**Credit risks**

Credit risk consists of the risk that Intrum’s counterparties are unable to fulfil their obligations to the
Group.

Financial assets that potentially subject the Group to credit risk include cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, portfolio investments, outlays on behalf of clients, derivatives and guarantees. For
financial assets owned by Intrum, no collateral or other credit reinforcements have been received, with
the exception of a certain portion of the Group’s portfolio investments. The maximum credit exposure for
each class of financial assets corresponds to the carrying amount.

_Cash and cash equivalents_

The Group’s cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of bank balances and other short-term financial
assets with a remaining maturity of less than three months. The Group has deposited its liquid assets with
established banks where the risk of loss is considered remote.

_Accounts receivable_

The Group’s accounts receivable from clients and customers in various industries, are not concentrated
in a specific geographical region. The Group’s largest client accounts for less than four percent of
revenues. Most accounts receivable outstanding are with clients previously known to the Group and
whose creditworthiness is good. For an analysis of accounts receivable by age, see Note 16.

_Portfolio investments_

As part of its portfolio investment operations, Intrum acquires portfolios of consumer receivables and tries
to collect them. Unlike its conventional collection operations where Intrum works on behalf of clients in
return for commissions and fees, in this case it assumes all the rights and risks associated with the
receivables. The portfolios are purchased at prices significantly below their nominal value, and Intrum
retains the entire amount it collects, including interest and fees.

The acquired receivables are overdue and in many cases are from customers who are having payment
problems. It is obvious, therefore, that the entire nominal amount of the receivable will not be recovered.
On the other hand, the receivables are acquired at prices significantly below their nominal value. The risk
in this business is that Intrum, at the time of acquisition, overestimates its ability to collect the amounts or
underestimates the costs of collection. The maximum theoretical risk is of course that the entire carrying
value of SEK 24,830 M (21,149) would become worthless and have to be written off.

F-110


-----

**Note 34: Financial risks and financial policies (continued)**

To minimise the risks in this business, prudence is exercised in purchase decisions. The focus is on small
and medium-sized portfolios with relatively low average amounts, to help spread risks. The average
nominal value per case is approximately SEK 18,465. Portfolios are normally acquired from clients with
whom the Group has had a long-term relationship. The acquisitions have generally consisted of
unsecured debt, requiring relatively less capital and significantly simplifying administration compared with
collateralised receivables. Since 2016, however, Intrum has also begun to acquire portfolios with
underlying collateral, usually in the form of property mortgages. Intrum places high yield requirements on
the portfolios it acquires. Before every acquisition, a careful assessment is made basedon a projection of
future cash flows (collected amount) from the portfolio. In these calculations Intrum benefits from its
extensive experience in debt collection and from the Group’s scoring methods. Intrum therefore believes
that it has the expertise required to evaluate these types of receivables. To enable acquisitions of larger
portfolios at attractive risk levels, Intrum has, on occasion, partnered with other companies such as
CarVal and Deutsche Bank to share the capital investment and return.

The portfolio values are reassessed quarterly for impairment, based on historical collection patterns as
well as macroeconomic forecasts.

The currency risk is attributable to the translation of the balance sheet item Portfolio investments is limited
due to currency hedging using loans in the same currency as the assets, and currency forwards. A
considerable proportion of the acquisitions take place through forward flow agreements—that is, Intrum
may have previously agreed with a company to acquire all of that company’s accounts receivable at a
certain percentage of their nominal value once they are overdue by a certain number of days. In most of
these agreements, however, Intrum has the opportunity to decline to acquire the receivables if, for
example, their quality decreases.

Risks are diversified by acquiring receivables from clients in different sectors and different countries. The
Group’s purchased debt portfolios include customers in 21 countries. The Group’s total carrying amount
for purchased debt is distributed as follows:

#### By country

Germany

11% (14)

Norway
Spain
Sweden 13% (13)
France 41% (40)

14% (15)

Other financial operations
Other sectors

10% (5)

63% (65)

16JUL201909140975

Of the total carrying value on the balance sheet date, 26 percent represents portfolios acquired in 2018,
25 percent those acquired in 2017, 13 percent those acquired in 2016 and 12 percent acquired in 2015.
The remaining 24 percent relates to receivables acquired in or before 2014, which have therefore been
past due for more than four years. In the case of a large share of the oldest receivables, Intrum has
reached agreement with the customers on payment plans.

F-111


-----

**Note 34: Financial risks and financial policies (continued)**

_Outlays on behalf of clients_

As an element in its operations, the Group incurs outlays for court fees, legal representation, enforcement
authorities, etc., which can be charged to and collected from customers. In many cases Intrum has
agreements with its clients whereby any expenses that cannot be collected from customers are instead
refunded by the client. The amount that is expected to be recovered from a solvent counterparty is
recognised as an asset in the balance sheet on the line Other receivables.

_Derivative contracts_

The Parent Company and the Group hold forward exchange contracts to a limited extent. The credit risk in
the Group’s forward exchange contracts is because the counterparty generally is a large bank or financial
institution that is not expected to become insolvent. On the balance sheet date, assets regarding forward
exchange contracts were valued at SEK 229 M (212), and liabilities at SEK 29 M (55). See Note 33
regarding the possibility of offsetting receivables and liabilities for derivative contracts.

The contracts have short maturities, typically one or more months. All outstanding forward exchange
contracts are restated at fair value in the accounts, with adjustments recognised in the income statement.
The purpose of these forward exchange contracts has been to minimise exchange rate differences in the
Parent Company attributable to receivables and liabilities in foreign currency.

Outstanding forward exchange contracts at year end in the Parent Company and in the Group comprise
the following currencies:

The Parent Company and the Group also hold currency interest rate swaps that were signed in
connection with the Parent Company’s issue of bonds in SEK. To achieve suitable currency matching
between assets and liabilities, liabilities in SEK were exchanged to EUR at the same rate on the starting
date and the date of maturity.

_Payment guarantees_

The Group offers services whereby clients, against payment, obtain a guarantee from Intrum regarding
the clients’ receivables from their customers. This entails a risk being incurred that Intrum must
compensate the client for the guaranteed amount in the event that the invoices are not paid on time. In
those cases where the guarantee comes into play, Intrum assumes the client’s claim against its customer
and takes over the continued handling of the case within the Portfolio Investments area of operations. At
the end of the year, the total amount guaranteed was SEK 120 M (111). Intrum’s risk in this business is
managed through strict credit limits and analyses of the borrower’s credit status. At the end of the year
Intrum had allocated SEK 1 M (1) in the balance sheet to cover payments that may arise due to the
guarantee.

**Note 35: Acquisitions and divestments**

In the cash flow statement, SEK 8,587 M (1,506) is reported as acquisitions of subsidiaries and joint
ventures.

For 2018, the amount relates to the acquisition of 51 percent of the shares in Intrum Italy Spa for
SEK 1,883 M, the acquisition of 100 percent of the shares in Northwind Investment Holding Sl for
SEK 1,787 M, the acquisition of Iplatform Consultoria e Participacoes SA for SEK 15 M, and the
acquisition of profit participating notes in Ithaca Investment DAC for SEK 4,902 M (recognised as
participations in a joint venture).

**Note 35: Acquisitions and divestments (continued)**

For 2017, the amount refers to the acquisition of 100 percent of the shares in CAF S.p.A. for SEK 1,307 M,
Asset Gate for SEK 19 M, LSF West S.r.l. for SEK 9 M, Mirus International for SEK 2 M, Top Factoring for
SEK 27 M, Intractive Wide Development for SEK 57 M, and the acquisition from the former minority
shareholder of 42 percent of the shares in IJCOF Corporate for SEK 85 M.

**Partnership with Banca Intesa Sanpaolo**

In April, Intrum entered into a partnership agreement with the Italian bank Banca Intesa Sanpaolo in April,
contributing a collection department with a labour force of 600 and a portfolio of overdue receivables that
is held together with an investor. The transaction was completed in early December. Intrum reports its
holding in the jointly-owned portfolio of receivables as a participation in a joint venture, Ithaca Investment
DAC, and the holding in the shared Italian collection business as a subsidiary, Intrum Italy Spa, in which
the minority share attributable to shares owned by Banca Intesa Sanpaolo is reported as non-controlling
interest.

On Intrum’s acquisition of the shared collection operation, the company In-trum Italy Spa, the following
preliminary acquisition analysis was prepared:

The company was included in the consolidated accounts effective from December 2018 and contributed
to consolidated revenues by SEK 113 M and to operating earnings by SEK 60 M. The company was
founded in 2018 and it would be inpractible to determine what revenues and earnings would have been if
it had existed the full-year.

The goodwill recognised is attributable to synergies in the form of expected cost savings and economies
of scale achieved when the Italian operations are integrated, and to the combined workforce.

**Acquisition of 100 percent of the shares in Northwind Investment Holding Sl**

In December, Intrum met with Ibercaja Banco SA to acquire 6,400 properties in Spain from Ibercaja and
the bank’s subsidiaries. The real estate portfolio has been transferred to a new company, in which Intrum
will initially be the majority shareholder, while Ibercaja’s subsidiary retains a minority holding of
20 percent. This company, Global Zappa Sl, is owned through a holding company by Northwind
Investment Holding Sl, in which Intrum has acquired 100 percent of the shares. Intrum’s final investment,
when financing and co-investors are in place, will amount to approximately EUR 30–40 M. Property
holdings are not a strategic area of focus for the Group.

In July, a majority shareholding of 51 percent was acquired in the Brazilian credit management company
iPlatform. The name of the company has been changed to Intrum Brasil Consultoria e Participa¸coes, S.A.
Goodwill of SEK 15 M has been recognised.

**Acquisition of Solvia**

In December, Intrum met with Banco Sabadell regarding the acquisition of the bank’s wholly owned
subsidiary Solvia Servicios Inmobiliaros (Solvia), which offers real estate management services in the
Spanish market. The transaction is expected to be concluded during the first half of 2019. Solvia’s
earnings for the second half of 2018 were below the expected level. Discussions are in progress with the
seller to reach a final agreement. The acquisition analysis has yet to be prepared.

**Merger with Lindorff**

On 12 June 2017, the EU Commission approved the merger of Intrum Justitia and Lindorff. The approval
was conditional on the divestment of Lindorff’s operations in Denmark, Estonia, Finland and Sweden, and
of Intrum Justitia’s operations in Norway. On 27 June the merger was effectuated and Lock TopCo AS
(the parent company of the Lindorff Group) with all of its subsidiaries have since been owned by Intrum
AB (publ).

The merger was effectuated through a non-cash issue whereby Intrum Justitia AB issued new shares in
exchange for all shares in Lock TopCo AS.

The preliminary acquisition analysis prepared by Intrum in connection with the merger has been adjusted
to the following final acquisition analysis. A change from the preliminary acquisition analysis previously
prepared is that contingent liabilities regarding some of Lindorff’s litigation and tax disputes, ongoing as
per the transaction date, are reported as current liabilities and provisions in the final acquisition analysis.

**Other acquisitions in 2017**

_Acquisition of 100 percent of the shares in CAF S.p.A (CAF)_

In December 2017, CAF S.p.A (CAF) was acquired, the third-largest credit management company for
unsecured claims in Italy. In connection with this, Intrum also acquired a large, diversified investment
portfolio where collection is handled by CAF. The total purchase consideration for CAF and the portfolio
was approximately EUR 200 M, on a cash and debt-free basis. CAF employs some 200 people in credit
management services at three locations in Italy. The acquisition analysis was detailed in the 2017 Annual
Report.

_Acquisition of 100 percent of the shares in Asset Gate GmbH_

In December 2017, Asset Gate GmbH was acquired. The company has been included in the consolidated
accounts as of December 2017. The acquisition analysis was detailed in the 2017 Annual Report.

_Acquisition of 100 percent of the shares in Mirus International BV_

In September 2017, Mirus International BV, a small credit management company in the Netherlands, was
acquired for a partial conditional purchase consideration of approximately EUR 5 M. The acquisition
analysis was detailed in the 2017 Annual Report.

_Acquisition of 100 percent of the shares in Top Factoring SA_

In April 2017, the acquisition of Top Factoring, one of the leading purchased debt companies in Romania,
was completed. The Company is mainly present in the bank and telecommunications sectors, with
several strong customer relationships generating recurring investment opportunities in portfolio
investments. The acquisition analysis was detailed in the 2017 Annual Report.

_Acquisition of the minority shareholding in IJCOF Corporate SAS_

In April 2017, Intrum acquired the minority shareholding of 42 percent of the shares in the French
subsidiary IJCOF Corporate SAS. IJCOF Corporate SAS is active in credit management for customers
with mainly corporate receivables.

**Note 35: Acquisitions and divestments (continued)**

_Acquisition of 100 percent of the shares in 1 Credit Ltd finalised_

In February 2017, the acquisition was completed of 1st Credit, a medium-sized company active in
portfolio investments in the UK. The name of the company has been changed to Intrum UK Ltd. The
company was consolidated as of February 2017. The acquisition analysis was detailed in the 2017
Annual Report.

_Acquisition of 100 percent of the shares in Intractiv Wide Development SAS_

In February 2017, a small business was acquired within Credit Management in France, Intractiv Wide
Development SAS. Intractiv mainly offers a digital platform in credit management for clients with
corporate receivables.

**Note 36: Critical estimates and assumptions**

To be able to prepare the accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices,
company management and the Board of Directors must make assessments and assumptions that affect
reported income and expense items, asset and liability items, as well as other disclosures. Management
has discussed with the Audit Committee the Group’s critical accounting principles and estimates as well
as the application of these.

Estimates and assumptions are continuously assessed on the basis of historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events considered reasonable under prevailing conditions.
Actual outcomes may vary from the assessments made.

The areas in which estimates and assumptions could entail significant risk of adjustment in the
recognised amounts for assets and liabilities in future fiscal years are primarily the following:

**Impairment testing of goodwill**

As indicated in Note 10, an impairment test of goodwill was done prior to the preparation of the annual
accounts. The geographical regions are judged to achieve a sufficient degree of integration that they form
combined cash generating units. Recoverable amounts for cash generating units have been established
by calculating their value in use. The assumptions and assessments made with regard to expected cash
flows and discount rates in the form of weighted average cost of capital, as well as a sensitivity analysis
are detailed in Note 10. Projections of future cash flows are based on the best possible assessments of
future income and operating expenses.

**Portfolio investments**

As indicated in Note 14, the recognition of portfolio investments in overdue receivables is based on the
Company’s own projection of future cash flows from the acquired portfolios. Although the Company has
historically had good projection accuracy with regard to cash flows, future deviations cannot be ruled out.

The Group applies internal rules and a formalised decision-making process in the adjustment of
previously established cash flow projections. These entail, among other things, that cash flow projections
are only in exceptional cases adjusted in the first year of ownership of a portfolio. Furthermore, an
amendment of the cash flow projection normally requires an agreement between local management in
the country in question and the Group’s risk department. All changes in cash flow projections are
ultimately decided on by a central revaluation committee.

**Sales of portfolio investments**

The Group has occasionally sold certain portfolios of purchased debt. Divestments of portfolios are not
included in the business model for this asset category. Intrum has assessed the transactions and
concluded that a sale of purchased debt should be recognised in the same way as if an amount equivalent
to the selling price had been collected as part of normal operations. For Intrum’s accounting, it does not
matter if the same amount is received through collection from customers or by sale to an external party.
The entire sale price for the portfolios sold has been reported as the amount collected on purchased debt,
and the entire carrying value remaining prior to the sale has been reported as amortisation of purchased
debt.

F-116


-----

**Note 36: Critical estimates and assumptions (continued)**

**Useful lifetimes of intangible and tangible fixed assets**

Group Management establishes assessed useful lifetimes and thus consistent amortisation and
depreciation for the Group’s intangible and tangible fixed assets. These estimates are based on historical
knowledge of equivalent assets’ useful lives. Useful life and estimated residual values are tested on each
balance sheet date and adjusted when necessary. Recognised values for each balance sheet date for
intangible and tangible fixed assets, see Notes 10 and 11.

**Assessment of deferred tax assets**

Deferred tax assets for tax-loss carry forwards or other future tax deductions are recognised to the extent
it is deemed likely that the deduction can be made against future taxable surpluses. Carrying amounts for
deferred tax assets on each balance sheet date are provided in Note 8.

**Reporting of Polish investment fund**

The Group has operated in Poland since 2006 through investment funds designed for the purchasing and
holding of portfolio investments. From the Group’s perspective, the funds function in practice as a
subsidiary. Against this backdrop, Intrum has resolved to consolidate the investment funds as a
subsidiary in the consolidated financial statements.

**Joint venture**

As stated in Note 13, in 2018, the Intrum Group invested in profit participating notes issued by the Irish
company Ithaca Investment DAC. Through its holding in the profit participating notes and the wording of
the agreement, Intrum holds a position closely corresponding to that of a shareholder in the company,
and the consolidated accounts therefore treat the profit participating notes as though they were an equity
instrument issued by Ithaca Investment DAC. Although Intrum’s holding corresponds to 80 percent of the
profit participating notes issued shareholder loans, through an agreement with another investor holding
20 percent of the profit participating notes, the two parties share a controlling influence, and Intrum
therefore reports the investment according to the rules for joint ventures.

**Acquisitions**

In 2018, Intrum entered into a partnership with Banca Intesa Sanpaolo, which included the acquisition of a
subsidiary and participations in a joint venture. During the final month of the year, a real estate company
was also acquired in Spain. The acquisitions and acquisition analyses are detailed in Note 35. The
acquisitions were large and complex, and the acquisition analyses may be adjusted in upcoming
quarters.

**Note 37: Related parties**

In addition to associated companies and joint ventures, related parties include the Board of Directors and
senior executives, according to Note 28, as well as close family members to these executives and other
companies over which they can exert a significant influence.

Transactions with related parties, individuals and companies, are conducted on market terms and at
arm’s length.

During 2018, Intrum sold services to LBHF Joint Ventures Ltd for SEK 5 M (1), a collection company in
which three Intrum employees in the UK, including Country Manager Edward Nott, are board members.

During 2018, Intrum sold services for SEK 10 M to Sbanken ASA, a bank in which a member of Intrum’s
Group Management, Cathrine Klouman, is a board member.

Although the Parent Company has close relationship to its subsidiaries, see Note 12, it has no
transactions with other related parties. Over the year, the Parent Company received SEK 214 M (159) in
income from sales of services to Group subsidiaries, and incurred SEK 203 M (14) in expenses
attributable to services purchased from subsidiaries.

**Note 38: Reconciliation of key figures (continued)**

**Return on portfolio investments**

Return on portfolio investments is the service line earnings for the period, excluding factoring and
payment guarantees, recalculated on a full-year basis, as a percentage of the average carrying amount of
the balance-sheet item Portfolio investments. The ratio sets the service line’s earnings in relation to the
amount of capital tied up and is included in the Group’s financial targets.

**EBITDA**

Operating earnings before depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) are operating earnings after reversal
of depreciation of fixed assets except portfolio investments.

**Cash EBITDA**

Cash EBITDA is operating earnings after depreciation on fixed assets as well as amortisation and
revaluations of portfolio investments are added back.

**Non-recurring items (NRIs)**

Significant earnings items that are not included in the Group’s normal recurring operations and that are
not expected to return on a regular basis. Non-recurring items include restructuring costs, closure costs,
reversal of restructuring or closure reservations, cost savings programmes, integration costs,
extraordinary projects, divestments, impairment of non-current fixed assets other than portfolio
investments, acquisition and divestment expenses, advisory costs for discontinued acquisition projects,
costs for relocation to new office space, termination and recruitment costs for members of Group
Management and country managers, as well as external expenses for disputes and unusual agreements.
Non-recurring items are specified because they are difficult to predict and have low forecast values for the
Group’s future earnings trend.

**Items affecting comparability**

Significant income statement items included in the Group’s regular recurring operations and which may
recur in any form, but which distort the comparison between the periods.

**EBIT, EBITDA AND cash EBITDA, excluding NRIs**

In accordance with the above, the key figures EBIT, EBITDA and Cash EBITDA are also reported after
recurring non-recurring items, NRIs.

**Adjusted operating earnings (EBIT)**

Adjusted operating earnings (EBIT) are operating earnings excluding revaluations of portfolio
investments, items affecting comparability and non-recurring items (NRIs).

**Pro forma financial reports including Lindorff**

Pro forma financial reports are issued for the Group including Lindorff, as if Lindorff had been included in
the Group throughout the comparison period. Pro forma earnings have been calculated by adding
Intrum’s and Lindorff’s actual results for each period without making adjustments for the periods in which
transaction costs would have been incurred if the acquisition had taken place at another time. Fair value
adjustments made in the acquisition analysis on Intrum Justitia’s acquisition of Lindorff are not recognised
in earnings for any period, although they can be recognised as costs in the acquired legal entity.

**Note 39: Discontinued operations and assets and liabilities in operations held for sale**

The merger between Intrum Justitia and Lindorff was implemented on 27 June 2017.

In connection with the merger, Intrum undertook to the European Commission to divest Intrum Justitia’s
Norwegian subsidiaries, as well as Lindorff’s Swedish, Finnish, Danish and Estonian subsidiaries. In
November 2017, Intrum agreed to divest these subsidiaries to a company in the Lowell Group, and the

**Note 39: Discontinued operations and assets and liabilities in operations held for sale**
**(continued)**

transaction was finalised in March 2018, in connection with which Intrum received the purchase
consideration of SEK 7,511 M.

In the income statement, the subsidiaries being divested in accordance with the above have been
reported in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-currrent Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations as
discontinued operations, with the comparative figures for previous years being recalculated. In the
balance sheet for 2017, these subsidiaries are reported as assets and liabilities in operations held for
sale, without the comparative figures being recalculated.

Earnings from discontinued operations are stated below:

The Board of Directors’ complete statement motivating the proposed disposition of earnings for the 2018
fiscal year will be presented in a separate document prior to the 2019 Annual General Meeting. It
concludes, among other things, that the proposed dividend is in line with the Company’s dividend policy
and that the Board, having considered the nature, scope and risks of the Company’s operations, as well
as the Company’s and the Group’s consolidation requirements, liquidity and financial position in general,
has found no indications that the proposed dividend is unjustified.

The Board of Directors and the President certify that the Annual Report has been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting standards in Sweden and that the consolidated accounts have been
prepared in accordance with the international accounting standards referred to in Regulation (EC)
No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002 on the application of
international accounting standards.

The annual accounts and consolidated accounts give a true and fair view of the financial position and
results of the Parent Company and the Group. The Board of Directors’ Report for the Parent Company
and the Group gives a true and fair overview of the operations, financial position and results of the Parent
Company and the Group, and describes significant risks and uncertainties that the Parent Company and
the companies in the Group face.

The annual and consolidated accounts were approved for publication by the Board of Directors and the
President on 28 March 2019 and are proposed for approval by the Annual General Meeting on 26 April
2019.

**Note 1: Significant accounting and valuation principles**

**General**

The Parent Company Intrum Justitia AB (publ) is a registered company domiciled in Stockholm, Sweden.
The address of the Company’s headquarters is Hesselmans Torg 14, Nacka, SE-105 24 Stockholm,
Sweden. During 2017, the Company was listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm, Large Cap list.

The consolidated accounts were approved for publication by the Company’s Board of Directors on
March 28, 2018. The balance sheets and income statements will be presented to the Annual General
Meeting on April 27, 2018.

The Parent Company’s functional currency is Swedish kronor (SEK), which is also the reporting currency
for the Parent Company and for the Group. The financial statements are therefore presented in SEK. All
amounts, unless indicated otherwise, are rounded off to the nearest SEK M.

The consolidated and annual accounts pertain to January 1–December 31 for income statement items
and December 31 for balance sheet items.

**Accounting standards applied**

With regard to the consolidated financial statements, the Annual Report for Intrum Justitia AB (publ) has
been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and the International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The Group applies
IFRS as adopted by the European Union (EU). For 2017, there are no new provisions relevant to Intrum in
the IFRS issued by the IASB that have not yet been adopted by the EU. This means that the Group’s
application of IFRS as adopted by the EU during the year also corresponds to the application of IFRS as
issued by the IASB.

Further, recommendation RFR 1 Supplementary accounting rules for groups from the Swedish Financial
Reporting Board has been applied.

The Parent Company applies the same accounting principles as the Group except in the cases stated in
the section ‘‘Parent Company accounting principles’’.

**Assumptions**

Assets and liabilities are recognized at historical cost, with the exception of certain financial assets and
liabilities, which are measured at fair value.

The preparation of financial reports in accordance with IFRS requires the Board of Directors and
Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the accounting principles
and the carrying values of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Estimates and assumptions are
based on historical experience and a number of other factors that under current circumstances seem
reasonable. The result of these estimates and assumptions is then used to determine the carrying values
of assets and liabilities that otherwise are not clearly indicated by other sources. Actual outcomes may
deviate from these estimates and assumptions.

Estimates and assumptions are reviewed regularly. Changes in estimates are recognized in the period in
which the change is made, provided it has affected only this period, or the period the change was made
and future periods if the change affects both current and future periods.

Estimates made by the Company that have a significant impact on the financial statements and
estimates, which could necessitate significant adjustments in financial statements in subsequent years,
are described in more detail in Note 36.

The accounting principles described below for the Group have been applied consistently for all periods in
the Group’s financial statements, unless otherwise indicated. The Group’s accounting principles have
been applied consistently in the consolidation of the Parent Company, subsidiaries, associated
companies and joint ventures.

**Note 1: Significant accounting and valuation principles (continued)**

**Changes in accounting principles**

_Changes that entered into force in 2017_

There are a number of minor changes and clarifications to IFRS with effect from 1 January 2017, although
none of these has had any significant impact on the Intrum Group’s accounting.

_Changes that enter into force in or after 2018_

The Group has decided against early application of any new or amended accounting recommendations or
interpretations that enter into force in or after 2018.

Effective from January 1, 2018, Intrum will apply IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which replaces
IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, and includes new rules for accounting of
credit losses, portfolio investments and hedge accounting. The new rules regarding loan losses and
hedge accounting have no significant effect on the Group. The new rules for portfolio investments entail
Intrum continuing to report these according to an effective interest rate model, with some minor
adjustments in the application. The greatest change is that, in accordance with IFRS 9, overdue
receivables can be reported at a higher recognized value than cost if estimates of future cash flows
change, which differs from Intrum’s current application of the corresponding rules under IAS 39.
Preliminarily, the effect is that retained earnings in the opening balance for 2018 increase by
approximately SEK 50 M. Comparative figures for previous years are not recalculated.

Effective from January 1, 2018, Intrum will also apply IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers,
replacing IAS 18 Revenue, and including new rules regarding when revenues on sales are to be reported
in certain cases. IFRS 15 is based on revenue being recognized when control of the good or service is
transferred to the customer, which differs from the current basis in the transfer of risks and benefits.
IFRS 15 introduces new ways of determining how and when revenue should be recognized, entailing a
new approach compared with how revenue is currently reported. The sectors most affected are the
construction and civil engineering sectors, as well as companies engaged in contract manufacturing. The
new accounting rules have no significant effect on the Intrum Group. However, all companies will be
affected by the new expanded disclosure requirements.

Effective from 2019, IFRS 16 Leases is to replace IAS 17 Leases. IFRS 16 provides that leases currently
accounted for as operating leases should generally start to be reported in a manner similar to the current
accounting for financial leases. This requires assets and liabilities also being reported for operating
leases, with associated reporting of costs for depreciation and interest, unlike today when no accounting
is performed for the leased asset and related liability, and with lease payments being amortized on a
straight-line basis as a lease expense. The main effect on Intrum’s accounting is expected to be the
Group’s total assets will increase through an asset or liability being recognized in respect of the leases in
effect at any given time. A rough estimate, based on previous years’ figures, is that the total assets
increase by about 5 percent. However, the figure is sensitive to the length of the remaining maturities on
current leases on the initial date of application of IFRS 16. Another effect is that the implicit interest
expense in the lease agreements is to be reported in net financial income and not in operating earnings,
entailing a certain improvement in operating earnings. Intrum does not intend to adopt IFRS 16
prematurely in 2018.

Other changes to IFRS are not expected to have any material effect on the consolidated accounts.

**Classification issues**

Fixed assets and long-term liabilities in the Parent Company and the Group consist of amounts that are
expected to be recovered or paid more than twelve months after the balance sheet date. Current assets
and current liabilities in the Parent Company and the Group consist of amounts that are expected to be
recovered or paid within twelve months of the balance sheet date.

**Consolidation**

_Subsidiaries_

The Group applies IFRS 3 Business combinations and IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements.

F-139


-----

**Note 1: Significant accounting and valuation principles (continued)**

The consolidated accounts include the annual accounts of all subsidiaries, i.e., companies in which the
Parent Company, directly or indirectly, holds more than 50 percent of the votes or otherwise can exercise
control over operations. A controlling interest is achieved when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to
variable returns from, its commitment to the Company and is able to affect returns by means of its
decisive influence. An influence arises when the Group has existing rights enabling it to control the
relevant operations, that is, the operations that significantly affect the Company’s performance.

The consolidated accounts are prepared according to the acquisition method, which means that the
acquisition of a subsidiary is treated as a transaction where the Group indirectly acquires the subsidiary’s
assets and takes over its liabilities and contingent liabilities. The Group’s equity therefore includes only
the portion of the subsidiary’s equity added since acquisition. The Group’s cost is determined through an
acquisition analysis in connection with the acquisition. The analysis determines the cost of the shares or
operations as well as the fair value of acquired, identifiable assets and assumed liabilities and contingent
liabilities. The cost of the subsidiary’s shares or operations consists of the fair value of the compensation
on the transfer date and transaction expenses directly attributable to the acquisition. The cost includes
conditional purchase considerations recognized as liabilities at fair value per the acquisition date.
Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.

In acquisitions where the cost exceeds the net value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities and
contingent liabilities, the difference is reported as goodwill. When the difference is negative, it is
recognized directly in the income statement.

Non-controlling interests arise in cases where the acquisition does not relate to the entire subsidiary.
There are two options for recognizing non-controlling interests. The two options are to recognize the
percentage of non-controlling interests that makes up proportional net assets, or to recognize
non-controlling interests at fair value, which means that non-controlling interests form a percentage of
goodwill. The method used for recognizing non-controlling interests is made on a case by case basis.

The financial reports of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated accounts from the acquisition date
until control ceases.

Intra-Group receivables and liabilities, revenue and expenses, and unrealized gains and losses that arise
from transactions within the Group are eliminated in their entirety in the consolidated accounts.

Unrealized gains arising from transactions with associated companies and joint ventures are eliminated
to a degree corresponding to the Group’s ownership of those companies. Unrealized losses are
eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, to the extent there is an indication of impairment.

_Associated companies and joint ventures_

The Group applies IAS 28 Investments in associates and joint ventures, and IFRS 11 Joint arrangements.

Associated companies are companies that are not subsidiaries but where the Parent Company, directly
or indirectly, has at least 20 percent of the votes or otherwise exercises significant influence without
having control over the partly owned company.

Participations in associated companies and joint ventures are recognized in the consolidated accounts
according to the equity method, which means that the holding in the company is recognized at cost and
subsequently adjusted to the Group’s share of the change in the associated company’s net assets. The
value of the shares includes goodwill from the acquisition. The consolidated income statement includes
the Group’s participation in the company’s earnings less goodwill impairment. The amount is reported
under Participations in the earnings of associates and joint ventures. Dividends received from the
company are not recognized in the income statement and instead reduce the carrying value of the
investment.

Any difference between the cost of an acquisition and the owner’s share of the net fair value of the
associated company’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognized in accordance
with IFRS 3.

The equity method is applied from the date a significant influence arises until the time it ceases or the
associated company becomes a subsidiary.

F-140


-----

**Note 1: Significant accounting and valuation principles (continued)**

If the Group’s share of reported losses in the company exceeds the carrying value of its participations, the
value of those participations is reduced to nil. Losses can also be offset against the Group’s unsecured
receivables from the company if they constitute part of the net investment. Further losses are not
recognized provided the Group has not issued guarantees to cover them.

_Joint ventures_

The Group applies IFRS 11 Joint arrangements.

Joint arrangements pertain to companies in which Intrum and other part-owners manage operations
jointly in accordance with a shareholder agreement.

Joint arrangements classified as joint ventures are reported in the consolidated accounts in accordance
with the equity method. Joint ventures are companies in which the Group, through collaborative
agreements, shares a controlling interest with one or more parties, such that the Group is entitled to net
assets rather than having a direct entitlement to assets and responsibility for liabilities. Jointly owned
companies are recognized at cost and subsequently adjusted for the Group’s share of the change in the
company’s net assets. The consolidated income statement includes the Group’s share of earnings, and
this is reported under Participations in the earnings of associates and joint ventures. Dividends received
from joint ventures are not recognized in the income statement and instead reduce the carrying value of
the investment. The equity method is applied from the date on which joint control is gained until the date
that it ceases or transitions to the sole influence of Intrum.

Shared operations, usually conducted in a company format, are joint arrangements in which Intrum and
one or more partners are entitled to all of the financial benefits related to the assets of the operations.
Shared operations are reported according to the profit split method, meaning that each party to a joint
venture reports its share of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.

_Foreign currency_

The Group applies IAS 21 Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.

_Transactions in foreign currency_

Group companies prepare their accounts in the local functional currency in the country where they have
their operations. Transactions in a currency other than the local currency are recognized at the exchange
rate in effect on the transaction day. When such transactions are offset or settled, the exchange rate may
deviate from the one that applied on the transaction day, in which case a (realized) exchange rate
difference arises. Moreover, monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are translated at the
exchange rates on each balance sheet date, due to which an (unrealized) exchange rate difference
arises. Both realized and unrealized exchange rate differences of this type are recognized in the income
statement—in the operating result if, for example, they refer to accounts receivable or accounts payable,
or in net financial items if they refer to financial investments and borrowing in foreign currency.

To avoid exchange rate differences, receivables and liabilities in foreign currency are sometimes hedged
through forward exchange contracts. The Group’s holding of forward exchange contracts is marked to
market on each balance sheet date, and changes in value are recognized through profit or loss.

_Translation of the financial statements of foreign operations_

Assets and liabilities in foreign operations, including goodwill and other Group surplus and deficit values,
are translated from the functional currency to the Group’s reporting currency, Swedish kronor, at the
exchange rate on balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated at the average rate, which
serves as an approximation of the rate that applied on each transaction date. Translation differences
arise in the translation of subsidiary accounts in part because the balance sheet date rate changes each
period and in part because the average rate deviates from balance sheet date rate. Translation
differences are recognized directly in total comprehensive income as the year’s change in the translation
reserve.

F-141


-----

**Note 1: Significant accounting and valuation principles (continued)**

Long-term receivables and liabilities between the Parent Company and subsidiaries can be seen as an
extension or reduction of the net investment in each company. Such translation differences are therefore
recognized in the consolidated financial statements in total comprehensive income.

When foreign operations are sold, accumulated translation differences attributable to those operations
are realized.

During the year the Group did not hedge any other flow exposure pertaining to anticipated receipts or
disbursements in foreign currency.

**Discontinued operations**

The Group applies WRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.

Net earnings in subsidiaries which are in the process of being divested or discontinued are reported on a
separate line item in the profit and loss statement, and hence these operations are not included in
consolidated revenues or operating earnings. The profit and loss statement for earlier years is restated
accordingly.

¨Assets and liabilities in an operation held for sale are reported on a separate line item in the balance sheet
from the time when a decision is made to divest them. The balance sheet for earlier years is not restated.

**Financial assets and liabilities**

The Group applies IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition
and Measurement, IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.

A financial instrument is defined as any form of agreement giving rise to a financial asset in a company
and a financial liability or equity instrument in a counterparty.

Financial instruments recognized in the balance sheet include, on the asset side, cash and bank
balances, accounts receivable and other equity instruments, loans receivable, portfolio investments and
derivatives. Client funds are recognized on a separate line in the balance sheet and therefore are not
included in the Group’s reported liquid assets. Included among liabilities and equity are accounts payable,
client funds payable, debt and equity instruments in issue, loan liabilities and derivatives.

Financial instruments are initially recognized at cost, corresponding to the instrument’s fair value plus
transaction expenses. Exceptions are financial instruments categorized as financial assets or liabilities
recognized at fair value in income statement, which are recognized at fair value excluding transaction
costs. Measurement depends on how they are classified, as indicated below.

A financial asset or financial liability is recognized in the balance sheet when the Company becomes party
to the instrument’s contractual terms. Receivables are recognized when the Company has performed and
there is a contractual obligation on the counterparty to pay, even if an invoice has not yet been received.
Accounts receivable are recognized in the balance sheet when an invoice has been sent. Liabilities are
recognized when the counterparty has performed and there is a contractual obligation to pay, even if an
invoice has not yet been received. Trade accounts payable are recognized when an invoice is received. A
financial asset is removed from the balance sheet when the rights in the agreement are realized, expire or
the Company loses control over them. A financial liability is removed from the balance sheet when the
obligation in the agreement has been discharged or otherwise extinguished.

The fair value of listed financial assets corresponds to their listed market price on the balance sheet date.
The fair value of unlisted financial assets is determined by using valuation techniques, e.g., recently
conducted transactions, the price of similar instruments and discounted cash flows. For forward
exchange contracts and currency interest rate swaps, fair value is determined based on listed prices. The
fair value of forward exchange contracts and currency interest rate swaps is calculated by discounting the
difference between the contracted forward rate and the forward rate that can be secured on the balance
sheet date for the remaining contract period. The current value is obtained by discounting applying the
Group’s weighted average cost of capital. For further information, see Note 34.

F-142


-----

**Note 1: Significant accounting and valuation principles (continued)**

_Portfolio investments_

Portfolio investments consist of portfolios of delinquent receivables purchased at prices significantly
below the nominal receivable. Portfolio investments usually refer to receivables from private individuals
and are usually unsecured receivables. They are recognized according to the rules for loans and
receivables in IAS 39, i.e., at amortized cost according to the effective interest model.

Income from portfolio investments is recognized in the income statement as the collected amount less
amortization. The collection is often performed by the same personnel who handle collections and debt
surveillance on behalf of external clients within the Credit Management service line. The cost of collection
is debited internally at market price and expensed in the income statement for the Portfolio Investments
service line as a cost of services sold.

Reporting follows the effective interest method, where the carrying value of each portfolio corresponds to
the present value of all projected future cash flows discounted by an initial effective interest rate
determined on the date the portfolio was acquired, based on the relation between cost and the projected
future cash flows on the acquisition date. Changes in the carrying value of the portfolios are comprised of
amortization for the period and are recognized in the income statement on the revenue line.

In connection with the purchase of each portfolio of receivables, a projection is made of the portfolio’s
cash flows. Cash flows include the loan amount, reminder fees, collection fees and late interest that,
based on a probability assessment, are expected to be received from debtors, less forecast collection
costs. With this forecast and the acquisition price including transaction costs as a basis, each portfolio is
assigned an initial effective interest rate that is then used to discount cash flows through the life of the
portfolio.

Current cash flow projections are monitored over the course of the year and updated based on, among
other things, achieved collection results, agreements reached with debtors on installment plans and
macroeconomic information. Cash flow projections are made at the portfolio level, since each portfolio of
receivables consists of a small number of homogeneous amounts. On the basis of the updated cash flow
projections and initial effective interest rate, a new carrying value for the portfolio is calculated in the
closing accounts.

The accounting model assumes each portfolio to be relatively homogeneous and comprising a large
number of receivables for smaller amounts. Portfolios comprising individual larger receivables are valued
on acquisition and at the level of the receivables in ongoing reporting over the lifecycle of the portfolio and
not at the portfolio level.

The Group applies internal application rules which mean that the initial effective interest rate can be
adjusted in certain cases without a change in the carrying value of the portfolio for minor projection
adjustments within a predetermined interval.

Changes over time in the book value can be divided into an anticipated time and interest rate component
(amortization) and a component related to changes in estimates of future cash flows (revaluation). The
effects of changes in cash flow forecasts, including changes in the anticipated financial lifetime of the
portfolio, are referred to as revaluations and treated symmetrically, i.e., both increases and decreases in
forecast flows affect the portfolios’ book value and, as a result, earnings. However, until 2017, the
portfolios were not reported at a higher value than cost.

Although selling portfolios of purchased debt is not included in the business model, when such sales do
occur as an exception, the resulting sales price received for the portfolio is reported in the same way as if
it had been recovered from the debtors. The entire remaining carrying values of the portfolios are
recognized as amortization.

_Long-term receivables and other receivables_

Long-term receivables and other receivables are those that arise when the Company provides money
without the intent to trade its claim. If the anticipated maturity is longer than one year they constitute
long-term receivables, and if it is shorter they are other receivables. These receivables fall into the
category Loans and accounts receivable and are assessed at their discounted current value if their
expected maturity exceeds 12 months. If their maturities are shorter, they are assessed at accrued cost.

F-143


-----

**Note 1: Significant accounting and valuation principles (continued)**

_Accounts receivable_

Accounts receivable are classified in the category loans and receivables. Accounts receivable are
recognized at the amount expected to be received after deducting impaired receivables, which are
determined individually or according to statistical models based on historical experience in each country.
Impairment needs are addressed when receivables have fallen overdue for payment by a certain number
of days, which differs between countries, or if Intrum becomes aware that the counterparty has become
insolvent. Provisions for impaired receivables are recognized as sales and marketing expenses. The
anticipated maturity of accounts receivable is short, so they are carried at accrued cost without
discounting.

_Legal outlays_

The Group incurs outlays for court fees, legal representation, enforcement authorities, etc., which can be
charged to and collected from debtors. In certain cases Intrum has agreements with its clients where any
expenses that cannot be collected from debtors are instead refunded by the client. The amount that is
expected to be recovered from a solvent counterparty is recognized as an asset in the balance sheet on
the line Other receivables. The anticipated maturity of these receivable is short, so they are carried at
accrued cost without discounting.

_Client funds_

Client funds, which are reported as assets and liabilities in the balance sheet, represent cash received on
collection of a specific debt on behalf of a client and payable to the client within a specified period. Client
funds are liquid funds with a restricted disposition right. The same amount is reported as a liability.

_Liquid assets_

Liquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents as well as immediately available balances with banks
and similar institutions. Short-term investments consist of investments with an insignificant risk of
fluctuating in value, which can easily be converted to cash and have a maturity of not more than three
months from acquisition.

_Liabilities_

Liabilities are classified as other financial liabilities, which means that they are initially recognized at the
amount received after deducting transaction expenses. Subsequent to acquisition, loans are carried at
amortized cost according to the effective rate method. Long-term liabilities have an anticipated maturity of
more than one year, while short-term liabilities have a maturity of less than one year. The Group’s
long-term loans generally have short fixed-interest periods, which means that the nominal loan amount
plus accrued interest is a good approximation of the liability calculated according to the effective rate
model.

_Accounts payable_

Accounts payable are classified in the category other financial liabilities. Accounts payable have a short
anticipated maturity and are carried without discounting at nominal amount.

_Derivative instruments_

Derivatives consist of forward exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and currency interest rate swaps
used to reduce interest and exchange rate risks attributable to assets and liabilities in foreign currency.
Derivatives are also contractual terms embedded in other agreements. Embedded derivatives are
recognized separately if they are not closely related to the host agreement.

Forward exchange contracts are classified as financial assets or liabilities recognized at fair value via the
income statement (held for trade) and assessed at fair value without deductions for transaction expenses
that may arise on sale or similar.

Hedge accounting is not needed for forward exchange contracts because the hedged item and the
hedging instrument are carried at fair value with changes in value recognized in the income statement as

F-144

**Note 1: Significant accounting and valuation principles (continued)**

exchange rate differences. Changes in the value of operations-related receivables and liabilities are
recognized in operating earnings, while changes in the value of financial receivables and liabilities are
recognized in net financial items.

Currency interest rate swaps are valued at fair value and reported in the balance sheet together with
hedge accounting via Other comprehensive income. Currency interest rate swaps were signed in
connection with the Parent Company’s issue of bonds in SEK that were exchanged for EUR to hedge net
investments in foreign operations where the loan currency has been used in the operations. The liability in
SEK was exchanged into the same liability in EUR on both the starting date and the date of maturity.

_Hedge accounting with regard to exchange rate risk in the net investment in foreign subsidiaries_

Investments in foreign subsidiaries (net assets including goodwill) are to some extent hedged through
loans in foreign currency or forward exchange contracts that are translated on the closing date to the
exchange rate then in effect. Translation differences for the period on financial instruments used to hedge
a net investment in a Group company are recognized in the degree the hedge is effective in total
comprehensive income, while cumulative changes are recognized in equity (translation reserve). As a
result, translation differences that arise when Group companies are consolidated are neutralized.

**Property holdings**

The Group applies IAS 2 Inventories.

In connection with acquisitions of portfolio investments and in connection with the recovery of collateral
for acquired receivables, Intrum may become owners of property holdings or other physical goods. These
are reported in the balance sheet at cost or net realizable value, whichever is lower.

When goods from these inventories are sold, the sales price received is recognized as income and the
amount recognized as an inventory asset is reported as an expense in the same period.

**Intangible fixed assets**

_Goodwill_

Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of an acquisition and the fair value of the acquired
assets, assumed liabilities and contingent liabilities.

If the Group’s cost of the acquired shares in a subsidiary exceeds the market value of the subsidiary’s net
assets according to the acquisition analysis, the difference is recognized as Group goodwill. The goodwill
that can arise through business combinations implemented through other than a purchase of shares is
recognized in the same way.

For business combinations where the cost is less than the net value of acquired assets and assumed and
contingent liabilities, the difference is recognized directly through profit or loss.

Goodwill is recognized at cost less accumulated impairment. The fair value of goodwill is determined
annually for each cash-generating unit in relation to the unit’s performance and anticipated future cash
flow. If deemed necessary, goodwill is written down on the basis of this evaluation. Intrum’s operations in
each geographical region (Northern Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, Western and Southern Europe
and Spain) are, in this context, considered to be the Group’s cash-generating units. Goodwill that arises
from the acquisition of a company outside Sweden is classified as an asset in the local currency and
translated in the accounts at the balance sheet date rate.

_Capitalized expenditure for IT development_

The Group applies IAS 38 Intangible Assets.

Expenditures for IT development and maintenance are generally expensed as incurred. Expenditures for
software development that can be attributed to identifiable assets under the Group’s control and with
anticipated future economic benefits are capitalized and recognized as intangible assets. These
capitalized costs include staff costs for the development team and other direct and indirect costs.
Borrowing costs are included in the cost of qualified fixed assets.

F-145


-----

**Note 1: Significant accounting and valuation principles (continued)**

Additional expenditures for previously developed software, etc. are recognized as an asset in the balance
sheet if they increase the future economic benefits of the specific asset to which they are attributable,
e.g., by improving or extending a computer program’s functionality beyond its original use and estimated
period of use.

IT development costs that are recognized as intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line
method over their useful lives (3–5 years). Useful life is reassessed annually. The asset is recognized at
cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses.

Costs associated with the maintenance of existing computer software are expensed as incurred

_Client relationships_

Client relationships that are recognized as fixed assets relate to fair value revaluations recognized upon
acquisition in accordance with IFRS 3. They are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated
period of use (5–10 years). Useful life is reassessed annually. The asset is recognized at cost less
accumulated amortization and impairment losses.

_Other intangible fixed assets_

Other intangible fixed assets relate to other acquired rights are amortized on a straight-line basis over
their estimated period of use (3–5 years). Useful life is reassessed annually. The asset is recognized at
cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses.

**Tangible fixed assets**

The Group applies IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment.

Tangible fixed assets are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost
includes the purchase price and costs directly attributable to putting the asset into place and condition to
be utilized in the way intended. Examples of directly attributable costs are delivery and handling,
installation, consulting services and legal services. Depreciation is booked on a straight-line basis over
the asset’s anticipated useful life (3–5 years). Useful life is reassessed annually.

The carrying value of a tangible fixed asset is excluded from the balance sheet when the asset is sold or
disposed of or when no economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal of the asset. The gain or
loss that arises on the sale or disposal of an asset is comprised of the difference between the sales price
and the asset’s carrying value less direct costs to sell. Gains and losses are recognized as other
operating earnings.

An annual determination is made of each asset’s residual value and a period of use.

Tangible fixed assets are recognized as an asset in the balance sheet if it is likely that the future economic
benefits will accrue to the Company and the cost of the asset can be reliably estimated.

**Leasing**

The Group applies IAS 17 Leases. Leasing is classified in the consolidated accounts as either finance or
operating leasing.

When a lease means that the Group, as lessee, essentially enjoys the economic benefits and bears the
economic risks attributable to the leased asset, it is classified as a finance lease. The leased asset is
recognized in the balance sheet as a fixed asset, while the estimated present value of future lease
payments is recognized as a liability. The portion of the lease fee that falls due for payment within one
year is recognized as a current liability, while the remainder is recognized as a long-term liability.
Minimum lease fees for finance leases are divided between interest expense and amortization of the
outstanding liability. Interest expense is divided over the lease term so that each reporting period is
charged with an amount corresponding to a fixed interest rate for the liability recognized in each period.
Variable fees are expensed in the period in which they arise.

In operating leasing, lease payments are expensed over the lease term. Payments are recognized in the
income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Benefits received in connection with the
signing of an operating lease are recognized as part of the total lease expense in the income statement.

F-146

**Note 1: Significant accounting and valuation principles (continued)**

**Taxes**

The Group applies IAS 12 Income Taxes.

Income taxes consist of current tax and deferred tax. Income taxes are recognized in the income
statement unless the underlying transaction is recognized directly in other total comprehensive income, in
which case the related tax effect is recognized in other total comprehensive income.

Current tax is tax that is to be paid or received during the year in question applying the tax rates applicable
on the balance sheet date; which includes adjustment of current tax attributable to previous periods.

Deferred tax is calculated according to the balance sheet method based on temporary differences
between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their value for tax purposes. The following
temporary differences are not taken into account: temporary differences that arise in the initial reporting of
goodwill, the initial reporting of assets and liabilities in a transaction other than a business combination
and which, at the time of the transaction, do not affect either the recognized or taxable result, or temporary
differences attributable to participations in subsidiaries and associated companies that are not expected
to be reversed within the foreseeable future. The valuation of deferred tax is based on how the carrying
values of assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. Deferred tax is calculated by applying
the tax rates and tax rules that have been set or essentially are set as of the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax assets from deductible temporary differences and tax-loss carryforwards are only
recognized if it is likely they will be utilized within the foreseeable future. The value of deferred tax assets
is reduced when it is no longer considered likely they can be utilized.

**Shareholders’ equity**

Share repurchases and transaction expenses are recognized directly against equity. Dividends are
recognized as a liability after they are approved by the Annual General Meeting.

**Provisions**

The Group applies IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.

A provision is recognized in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or informal obligation owing to
an event that has occurred and it is likely that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle
the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. The carrying amount for the provision is
based on an assessment of the most likely outcome, and can be calculated by weighing the various
possible outcomes and multiplying this by their estimated probability. Where it is important when in time
payment will be made, provisions are estimated by discounting the forecast future cash flow at a pretax
interest rate that reflects current market estimates of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the
risks associated with the liability.

A provision for restructuring is recognized when a detailed, formal restructuring plan has been
established and the restructuring has either begun or been publicly announced. No provision is made for
future operating expenses.

A provision for termination costs is recognized only if the persons in question have known or presumed to
have expected to be terminated by the balance sheet date.

A provision is recognized for a loss-making contract when anticipated benefits that the Group expects to
receive from a contract are less than the unavoidable costs to fulfill the obligations as set out in the
contract. A provision for dilapidation agreements on leased premises is recognized if there is a
contractual obligation to the landlord, within the foreseeable future, to restore the premises to a certain
condition when the lease expires.

**Unidentified receipts and excess payments**

The Group receives large volumes of payments from debtors for itself and its clients. There are instances
where the sender’s reference information is missing or incorrect, which makes it difficult to allocate the
payment to the right case. There are also situations where payments are received on closed cases. In
such instances a reasonable search and attempt is made to contact the payment sender but, failing this,
the payment is recognized as income after a certain interval. A provision is recognized in the balance

F-147


-----

**Note 1: Significant accounting and valuation principles (continued)**

sheet corresponding to the anticipated repayments of incorrectly received payments on a probability
analysis.

**Contingent liabilities**

A contingent liability is recognized when there is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose
existence will be confirmed only by one or more uncertain future events or when there is an obligation that
is not recognized as a liability or provision because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be
required.

**Impairment**

The Group applies IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.

The carrying value of the Group’s assets, with certain exceptions, is tested on each balance sheet date for
any indication of impairment. IAS 36 is applied to impairment testing of all assets with the exception of
financial assets, which are valued according to IAS 39, investment assets for pension liabilities, which are
valued according to IAS 19 Employee Benefits, and tax assets, which are valued according to
IAS 12 Income Taxes.

If there is any indication of impairment, the asset’s recoverable value is estimated. For goodwill and other
intangible assets with an indeterminate useful life and intangible assets not yet brought into use,
recoverable values are calculated annually. If essentially independent cash flows cannot be isolated for
individual assets, the assets are grouped at the lowest level where essentially independent cash flows
can be identified, i.e., a cash-generating unit. Intrum’s operations in each geographical region are
considered to be the Group’s cash-generating units in this regard.

Impairment is recognized when the carrying value of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its
recoverable value. Impairment is recognized in the income statement. Impairment losses attributable to a
cash-generating unit are mainly allocated to goodwill, after which they are divided proportionately among
other assets in the unit.

The recoverable amount of cash-generating units is the higher of their fair value less costs to sell and
value in use. Value in use is measured by discounting future cash flows using a discounting factor that
takes into account the risk-free rate of interest and the risk associated with the specific asset.

Impairment of goodwill is not reversed. Impairment of other assets is reversed if a change has been made
in the assumptions that served as the basis for determining the recoverable amount. Impairment is
reversed only to the extent the carrying value of the assets following the reversal does not exceed the
carrying value that the asset would have had if the impairment had not been recognized.

**Employee benefits**

The Group applies IAS 19 Employee Benefits.

**Pension obligations**

The Group’s pension obligations are, for the most part, secured through official pension arrangements or
insurance solutions. Pension obligations vary between countries on the basis of legislation and different
pension systems. See also Note 21 for a further description.

Defined contribution pension plans are plans where the Company’s obligation is limited to the fees it has
committed to pay. The size of the employee’s pension depends in part on the fees the Company pays to
an insurance company and in part on the return generated and actuarial factors. Consequently, it is the
employee who assumes the investment risk and actuarial risk. The Company’s obligations for defined
contribution pension plans are expensed through the income statement as they are vested by employees
who render services on behalf of the Company.

For defined benefit pension plans, the pension obligation does not cease until the agreed pensions have
been paid. The Group’s net obligation for defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each
plan by estimating future compensation the employees has earned in current and previous periods; this
compensation is discounted to its present value. The discount rate is the interest rate as per the balance

F-148

**Note 1: Significant accounting and valuation principles (continued)**

sheet date on high-quality corporate bonds, including covered bonds, with a maturity that, if possible,
corresponds to the Group’s pension obligations. The calculation is performed by an actuary using the
so-called Projected Unit Credit Method. The fair value of Intrum’s share of any investment assets as of the
balance sheet date is calculated as well. Actuarial gains and losses may arise in the determination of the
present value of the obligation and the fair value of investment assets. They arise either because the
actual outcome deviates from previous assumptions or the assumptions change. All changes in value
associated with such changes in assumptions are recognized in other comprehensive income.

The balance sheet value of pensions and similar obligations is therefore equivalent to the present value
on the balance sheet date less the fair value of assets under management.

Pension costs for service in the current period are reported in the operating earnings, while the calculated
interest expense on the pension liability and the interest income from assets under management are
reported in net financial items.

Pension obligations in Sweden that are met through pension insurance premiums to Alecta in the
so-called ITP 2 plan are reported as defined contribution pension solutions.

**Borrowing costs**

The Group applies IAS 23 Borrowing Costs and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement.

Costs to secure bank financing are amortized across the term of the loan as financial expenses in the
consolidated income statement. The amount is recognized in the balance sheet as a deduction to the loan
liability.

The Group capitalizes borrowing costs in the cost of qualifying assets, that is, fixed assets for substantial
amounts with long periods of completion. No such investments were initiated in 2015 or 2016.

**Revenue recognition**

The Group applies IAS 18 Revenue.

Income, consisting of commissions and collection fees is recognized on collection of the debt.
Subscription revenue is recognized proportionately over the term of the underlying service contracts,
which is usually one year.

**Financial income and expenses**

Financial income and expenses consist of interest income on bank balances and receivables and
interest-bearing securities, bank fees, interest expenses on loans, dividend income, exchange rate
differences, realized and unrealized gains on financial investments, and derivatives used in financial
operations.

**Payment guarantees**

Intrum offers some of the Group’s clients the opportunity, against payment, to obtain a guarantee from
Intrum regarding the clients’ receivables from their customers. The guarantee entails an undertaking by
Intrum to acquire the receivable from the creditor at its nominal value, or a certain part thereof, once it has
fallen overdue for payment by a certain number of days. The income, in the form of a guarantee fee, is
recognized when the guarantees are issued, while a liability is recognized in the balance sheet for
expected losses related to those guarantees. If the debtor fails to make payment, Intrum acquires the
claim. The disbursement is then recognized as an acquisition of a receivable, less the liability recognized
when the guarantee was issued.

**Cash flow statement**

The Group applies IAS 7 Cash Flow Statements.

The cash flow statement includes changes in the balance of liquid assets. The Group’s liquid assets
consist of cash and bank balances. Cash flow is divided into cash flows from operating activities,
investing activities and financing activities.

F-149


-----

**Note 1: Significant accounting and valuation principles (continued)**

Cash flow from investing activities includes only actual disbursements for investments during the year.
Disbursements for the purchase of portfolios of overdue receivables are reported under cash flow from
investing activities, while the collection and repayment of such portfolios are reported under cash flow
from operating activities.

Foreign subsidiaries’ transactions are translated in the cash flow statement at the average exchange rate
for the period. Acquired and divested subsidiaries are recognized as cash flow from investing activities,
net, after deducting liquid assets in the acquired or divested company.

**Earnings per share**

The Group applies IAS 33 Earnings per Share.

Earnings per share consist of net earnings for the year (attributable to the Parent Company’s
shareholders) divided by a weighted average number of outstanding shares during the year. In this
context, treasury holdings of repurchased shares are not included in outstanding shares.

**Segments**

The Group applies IFRS 8 Operating Segments.

An operating segment is a part of the Group from which it can generate income and incur expenses and
for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating
decision maker, i.e. the CEO in deciding how to assess performance and allocate resources to the
operating segment.

Intrum’s operating segments are the geographical regions of Northern Europe (Denmark, Estonia, Latvia,
Lithuania, Finland, Norway and Sweden), Central and Eastern Europe (Greece, Poland, Romania,
Switzerland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary and Austria), Western and Southern
Europe (Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and the UK) and Spain. Central and
joint expenses are spread across the geographical regions in proportion to their purchasing power parityadjusted revenues. The break-down by geographical region is also used for internal monitoring in the
Group.

Among other things, Note 2 details net revenue and operating earnings by geographic region. However,
interest income, interest expenses, assets and liabilities are not reported by segment. This is not
considered relevant because the distribution of financial items and parts of the balance sheet is
dependent on Group structure and financing, which are not affected by the actual performance of the
regions. Nor are actual reported interest income, interest expenses, assets and liabilities by segment
included in any internal reporting to the CEO.

**Parent Company’s accounting principles**

The Parent Company has prepared the Annual Report according to the Annual Accounts Act (1995:1554)
and recommendation RFR 2 Accounting for Legal Entities from the Swedish Financial Reporting Board.
RFR 2 means that the Parent Company, in the Annual Report for the legal entity, must apply all
EU-approved IFRS and statements as far as possible within the framework of the Annual Accounts Act
and taking into account the connection between reporting and taxation. The recommendation specifies
exemptions and additions relative to IFRS.

_Differences between the Group’s and Parent Company’s accounting principles_

The differences between the Group’s and Parent Company’s accounting principles are indicated below.
The accounting principles for the Parent Company as stated below have been applied consistently to all
periods presented in the Parent Company’s financial statements.

_Subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures_

Shares in subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures are recognized by the Parent Company
at cost, including transaction costs less any impairment. Only dividends received are recognized as
income.

F-150


-----

**Note 1: Significant accounting and valuation principles (continued)**

_Group contributions and shareholders’ contributions for legal entities_

The Company reports Group contributions and shareholders’ contributions in accordance with statement
RFR 2 of the Swedish Financial Reporting Board.

Group contributions received are recognized as dividends and Group contributions paid are recognized
as shareholders’ contributions. Shareholders’ contributions are recognized directly in the shareholders’
equity of the recipient and capitalized in the shares and participating interests of the contributor, to the
extent impairment is not required.

_Other_

The Parent Company has no leases classified as finance leases in its own accounts or the consolidated
accounts.

**Note 2: Information by geographic region and service line (continued)**

No individual customer is responsible for generating more than four percent of total consolidated revenue.

The distribution of revenues and earnings by geographical region is based on where clients are located.

The geographical regions are Northern Europe (Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Norway
and Sweden), Central and Eastern Europe (Greece, Poland, Romania, Switzerland, Slovakia, the Czech
Republic, Germany, Hungary and Austria), Western and Southern Europe (Belgium, France, Ireland,
Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and the UK) and Spain (Spain). Central and joint expenses are spread
across the geographical regions in proportion to their purchasing power parity-adjusted revenues. The
break-down by geographical region is also used for internal monitoring in the Group.

Intra-Group sales between the regions are made on commercial terms. Internal transactions between the
business areas Financial Services and Credit Management Services relate to payment on commercial
terms for work carried out within Credit Management regarding handling and collection on the Group’s
portfolio investments. Payment is made in the form of a commission that is recognized as a cost within
Financial Services, but which is eliminated in the Consolidated Income Statement.

Interest income and expenses are not reported by segment. This is not considered relevant because the
distribution of financial items is dependent on Group structure and financing and is not affected by the
actual performance of the regions. Nor are actual reported interest income and expenses by segment
included in any internal reporting to the CEO.

In addition, a tax expense of SEK �41 M (�13) from divested operations is also recognized. No tax is
recognized in respect of capital gains,

The Group has operations in more than 20 countries in Europe, with various tax rates. The current tax
expense for the year relates mainly to income taxes in Hungary, Switzerland, Spain, France, Germany,
the Czech Republic, Finland, Belgium and Portugal. The Group’s Swedish companies paid no income tax
for the relevant year as they were able to utilize tax-loss carryforwards from historic losses.

Intrum Justitia AB (publ) is domiciled in Sweden where the nominal corporate tax rate in 2016 and 2017
was 22 percent. The following reconciliation explains the difference between the Group’s actual tax cost

**Note 8: Taxes (continued)**

assets pertaining to tax-loss carryforwards relate to the positive tax effect over the year arising through
the utilization of tax-loss carryforwards never previously recognized as deferred tax assets.

When differences arise between the tax value and carrying value of assets and liabilities, a deferred tax
asset or tax liability is recognized. Such temporary differences mainly arise for portfolio investments,
provisions for pensions and intangible assets. Deferred tax assets include the value of tax-loss
carryforwards in the instances where they are likely to be utilized to offset taxable surpluses within the
foreseeable future.

The deferred tax assets and income tax liabilities are expected to be due for payment in over one year.

The Group has tax-loss carryforwards that can be utilized against future earnings totaling SEK 6,215 M
(1,803). Deferred tax assets are reported in the balance sheet, when it is expected to be possible to offset
the loss carryforwards against taxable profits within the foreseeable future. In the calculation of deferred
tax liabilities attributable to temporary differences in the recognition of portfolio investments, however,
SEK 358 M (91) has been subtracted, corresponding to a cautiously calculated option to offset the
deferred tax liabilities against tax losses in the same country.

Tax-loss carryforwards in countries with maturities for the utilization of those carryforwards relate to
Poland with SEK 47 M (3), the Netherlands with SEK 165 M (151) and Slovakia with SEK 3 M (9). In
Poland, the tax-loss carryforwards can be utilized only for a period of five years from the year of the loss,
in the Netherlands for nine years and in Slovakia for four years. No deferred tax assets are recognized for
the tax-loss carryforwards in Poland and the Netherlands.

Tax-loss carryforwards for which no deferred tax assets are recognized pertain mainly to Sweden with
SEK 1,484 M (895) and the UK with SEK 337 M (340). In Sweden, loss carryforwards include a deficit of
SEK 1,357 M (895) in the Parent Company. As a consequence of the costs for the head office expenses
and financing costs, the Parent Company has for several years incurred a tax deficit, even when taking in
to account the group contributions received from the profitable companies conducting business in
Sweden. It is Intrum’s assessment that tax-loss carryforwards cannot be fully utilized against positive
taxable income in the foreseeable future without first restructuring the Group internally so that, for
example, the Parent Company’s interest expenses are transferred to foreign subsidiaries. If such
restructuring is implemented, it may be relevant to increase the reported value of the tax-loss
carryforwards in the accounts. Because the tax-loss carryforwards exist in the Parent Company and
holding companies, they are not involved in the impairment testing of goodwill that pertains to the
business of the subsidiaries. Loss carryforwards in Sweden may also be consumed through so-called
CFC taxation on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries with revenues subject to low tax rates. Accordingly, a
cautiously valued deferred tax asset of SEK 199 M (0) is recognized for the Parent Company.

Tax-free income and non-deductible expenses in the Parent Company consist largely of dividends from
subsidiaries and non-deductible expenses in connection with the acquisition of Lindorff. The Parent
Company had accumulated tax-loss carryforwards of SEK 1,357 M (895) at year-end as a result of both
income items and unrealized translation differences recognized in other comprehensive income. To the
extent that it is expected to be possible to utilize them against future taxable earnings, deferred tax assets
are reported for these loss carryforwards in the amount of SEK 199 M (0).

**Note 10: Intangible fixed assets (continued)**

Payments during the year regarding investments in intangible fixed assets amounted to SEK 116 M
(117) for the Group.

Capitalized expenditure for IT development is mainly generated internally using our own employees
and/or contracted consultants.

Client relations and goodwill are acquired in connection with business acquisitions. Other intangible fixed
assets are mainly acquired externally.

**Impairment testing for cash-generating units containing goodwill**

The Group treats the following geographical regions as cash-generating units in the sense referred to in
IAS 36 Impairment of assets. At the end of 2017, goodwill on cash-generating units was distributed as
follows: Northern Europe SEK 11,870 M, Central and Eastern Europe SEK 5,148 M, Western and
Southern Europe SEK 4,125 M and Spain SEK 8,422 M, that is, a total of SEK 29,565 M. At the end of
2016, goodwill on the cash-generating units into which the Group was then organized was distributed as
follows: Northern Europe SEK 1,665 M, Central Europe SEK 434 M and Western Europe SEK 1,021 M,
that is, a total of SEK 3,120 M.

Impairment testing of goodwill for each cash-generating unit was done prior to preparation of each year’s
annual accounts. The recoverable amount is determined through an estimation of its value in use. For
each cash-generating unit, management has compiled a projection of annual future cash flows based on
historical experience and the Company’s own plans and estimates for the future. The calculation is based
on a detailed forecast for the next three years and an annual increase thereafter of 1 percent. The cash
flows have been discounted to present value applying the Group’s weighted average cost of capital,
which is estimated at 4.0 percent (4.6) per year after tax. The recoverable amount has been compared for
each unit with the Group’s net book value of the unit’s assets and liabilities. The test gave no indication of
a need of goodwill impairment.

Impairment testing is based on a number of assumptions, where the outcome is judged to be most
sensitive to some of those assumptions in particular:

For 2019, annual revenue growth of 4 percent (2) is assumed, and for 2020, 2 percent (1), with each
SEK 1,000 in increased revenue being assumed to result in an increase in working capital of SEK 350
(250), that is, an ‘‘incremental increase in earnings’’ of 35 percent (25). For the period after 2020,
perpetual growth in cash flow of 1 percent (1) annually is assumed. The same assumptions were applied
for all geographical regions. The same discount rates were also applied, since no long-term difference
can be identified between the regions’ growth potential or risk.

**Sensitivity analysis**

A sensitivity analysis has been performed, in which cash flows have been discounted at 6 percent interest
after tax. Even with this assumption, impairment testing did not indicate any need to recognize
impairment in goodwill for any of the regions.

In the Netherlands, a VAT receivable arises in connection with portfolio investments. The VAT portion of
the acquired receivable can be recovered from the tax authorities if it is not collected from the debtor and
is therefore recognized in certain cases as a separate receivable. The portion that is expected to be
recovered within 12 months is recognized as current.

In the Netherlands, bailiffs are private companies and expenses for collection cases paid to them can
sometimes be recovered from the bailiffs if their collection measures fail. When it emerges that Intrum is
entitled to request that the amount be returned from the enforcement authorities, the amount is moved
from Outlays on behalf of clients, to To recover from bailiffs.

amount to not less than SEK 1,300,000 and not more than SEK 5,200,000. All shares are fully paid in,
carry equal voting rights and share equally in the Company’s assets and earnings. No shares are
reserved for transfer.

There are 131,541,320 shares in the Company, and the share capital amounts to SEK 2,899,805.49.

**Share repurchase**

No shares were repurchased in 2016 or 2017. In 2015, 1,499,808 shares were repurchased for SEK 400
M. In accordance with a resolution by the Annual General Meeting in April 2016, the 1,073,602 treasury
shares held at the time, having been repurchased in April–December 2015, were canceled and the
number of registered shares in the Company fell from 73,421,328 to 72,347,726. The share capital was
reduced by SEK 23,322, but was immediately restored through a bonus issue and transfer from retained
earnings.

**New share issue**

On June 27, 2017, Intrum Justitia AB merged with Lindorff and completed a non-cash issue, whereby
Intrum Justitia AB issued 59,193,594 new shares at a subscription price of SEK 292.80 per share, in
exchange for all shares in Lock TopCo AS, the parent company of the Lindorff Group. Accordingly, there
are 131,541,320 shares outstanding in Intrum. Accordingly, the average number of shares outstanding in
2017 was 102,674,307.

**Other shareholders’ equity in the Group**

_Other paid-in capital_

Refers to equity other than share capital contributed by the owners or arising owing to the Group’s
shared-based payment programs. Also included are share premiums paid in connection with new issues.

_Reserves_

Includes the translation reserve, which contains all exchange rate differences that have, since the
transition to IFRS in 2004, arisen in the translation of financial statements from foreign operations as well
as long-term intra-Group receivables and liabilities that represent an increase or decrease in the Group’s
net investment in the foreign operations. The amount also includes exchange rate differences arising in

F-169


-----

**Note 20: Shareholders’ equity (continued)**

the Parent Company’s external loans in foreign currency, which are intended to hedge the Group’s
translation exposure attributable to net assets in foreign subsidiaries.

_Retained earnings including net earnings for the year_

Refer to earnings in the Parent Company and subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated companies.
Provisions to the statutory reserve, excluding transferred share premium reserves, were previously
included in this item. Accumulated revaluations of the Group’s defined benefit pension provisions are also
included. Dividends paid and share repurchases are deducted from the amount.

Following the balance sheet date the Board of Directors proposed a dividend of SEK 9.50 per share
(9.00), or a total estimated payout of SEK 1,250 M (651).

**Other shareholders’ equity in the Parent Company**

_Statutory reserve_

Refers to provisions to the statutory reserve and share premium reserve prior to 2006. The statutory
reserve is restricted equity and may not be reduced through distributions of earnings.

_Share premium reserve_

When shares are issued at a premium, the amount exceeding their quota value is transferred to the share
premium reserve. Provisions to the share premium reserve as of 2006 are non-restricted equity.

_Fair value reserve_

Refers to unrealized exchange rate gains or losses on external loans in foreign currency, which are
intended to hedge the Group’s translation exposure attributable to net assets in foreign subsidiaries. The
fair value reserve is non-restricted equity.

_Earnings brought forward_

Refer to retained earnings from the previous year less the dividend paid and share repurchases. Retained
earnings are non-restricted equity.

_Capital structure_

The Company’s definition of capital corresponds to shareholders’ equity including holdings without a
controlling interest, which at year-end totaled SEK 22,439 M (4,130).

The measure of the Company’s capital structure used for control purposes is consolidated net debt in
relation to pro forma rolling 12-month-adjusted cash EBITDA, which at year-end amounted to 4.1. This
ratio is calculated by placing current consolidated net debt at the end of the year in relation to pro forma
cash EBITDA, including operations being phased out and including a calculated cash EBITDA throughout
the period for larger units acquired during the year, and excluding non-recurring items (NRIs). Net debt is
defined as the sum of interest-bearing liabilities and pension provisions less liquid funds and interestbearing receivables.

The Board of Directors has established financial targets for the Group, in which net debt divided by pro
forma rolling 12-month-adjusted cash EBITDA, as stated above, shall be between 2.5 and 3.5 in the long
term.

**Note 21: Pensions**

Employees in Intrum’s companies are covered by various pension benefits, some of which are defined
benefit plans and others as defined contribution plans. The Group applies IAS 19 Employee Benefits,
which contains, among other things, uniform regulations on the actuarial calculation of provisions for
pensions in defined benefit plans.

Group employees in Norway and Switzerland, and certain employees in Germany, are covered by
pension plans funded through assets under the management of insurance companies and are reported
as defined benefit pension plans. Other employees in Germany are covered by an unfunded defined
benefit pension plan that can be paid out as a one-time sum or as monthly payments following retirement.
In France and Italy, the Company makes provisions for one-time payments made to employees on
retirement, and these provisions are also reported according to the rules for defined benefit pension

**Note 21: Pensions (continued)**

plans. In Belgium and Sweden, there are pension plans, funded through insurance, which theoretically
should have been reported as defined benefit plans, but which are recognized as defined contribution
plans since the Company lacks sufficient data to report them as defined benefit plans. See also below
regarding the ITP 2 plan.

Among other things, IAS 19 requires pension costs for service in the current period to be reported in the
operating earnings, while the calculated interest expense on the pension liability and the interest income
from assets under management are reported in net financial items. Actuarial revaluations are recognized
in other comprehensive income.

The Group also finances a number of defined contribution plans, Consolidated expenses for these
amounted to SEK 108 M (92).

**Funded defined benefit pension plans**

For Group employees in Switzerland, commitments exist in the form of obligatory service pension plans
funded through insurance policies in the Swiss Life Collective BVG Foundation and in Transparenta BVG
Foundation. The funded commitments currently amount to SEK 273 M (246), and the fair value of the
assets under management is SEK 206 M (193). Consequently, the net pension liability is SEK 67 M (53).
The pension commitment is funded through insurance contracts. During the year Intrum paid
SEK 40 M (38) to the plan, while disbursements to retirees amounted to SEK 22 M (46). In 2017 payments
to the plan are estimated at SEK 40 M, with disbursements to retirees of SEK 22 M. For these pension
plans, a discount rate of 0.75 percent is applied. An increase/decrease in the discount rate by
0.5 percentage points would entail the pension liability decreasing by 7.8 percent/increasing by
9.0 percent.

For the Group’s employees in Norway, there are commitments for a compulsory service pension, which
are secured through insurance with the insurance company DNB Livsforsikring. The funded
commitments currently amount to SEK 33 M, and the fair value of the assets under management is SEK
21 M. Consequently, the net pension liability is SEK 12 M. The pension commitment is funded through
insurance contracts. For these pension plans, a discount rate of 2.3 percent is applied.

**ITP 2 plan**

The commitments for retirement and family pensions for the Group’s Swedish employees are secured
through insurance with Alecta according to the so-called ITP 1 and ITP 2 plans. ITP 1 includes employees
born in 1979 or later, while ITP 2 covers employees born in 1978 or earlier. ITP 1 is a defined contribution
plan. On the other hand, according to a statement from the Swedish Financial Reporting Board, UFR 10,
the ITP 2 plan is a multi-employer defined benefit plan. Alecta’s customers have not had access to such
information for the fiscal year that would make allow them to report their proportional share of plan assets,
liabilities and costs, preventing it from being possible to report the plan as a defined benefit plan. Nor is
there a contractual agreement how surpluses and deficits in the plan are to be distributed among plan
participants. The ITP 2 plan secured through insurance with Alecta is therefore reported by Intrum as if it
were a defined contribution plan. The premium is individually calculated, depending on salary, previously
vested pension and anticipated remaining term of employment. At year-end Alecta’s surplus in the form of
the collective funding ratio was 154 percent (149). The collective funding ratio consists of the market
value of Alecta’s assets as a percentage of the insurance obligations calculated according to Alecta’s
actuarial assumptions, which do not conform to IAS 19. Under the provisions of the ITP 2 plan, measures
must be taken if the funding ratio falls below 125 percent (for example, in connection with an increase in
the price of the subscription) or exceed 155 percent (for example, in connection with a premium
reduction).

On June 16, 2017, Intrum Justitia AB signed a 4.5-year revolving syndicated loan facility of a total
EUR 1,100 M with a bank consortium of five Nordic banks to replace the previous facility from 2015 and to
support the merged company’s liquidity needs and meet future investment opportunities. The loan
framework of EUR 1,100 M can be utilized for borrowing in a number of different currencies. On
December 31, 2017, the loan framework had been utilized for loans in SEK totaling SEK 700 M (0), in
EUR totaling EUR 100 M (15), in GBP totaling EUR 102 M (0), in PLN totaling PLN 0 M (240) and in HUF
totaling HUF 0 M (28,300). The unutilized portion of the facilities amounted to SEK 8,008 M (5,964). The
loan carries a variable interest rate based on the interbank rate in each currency, with a margin. The loan
facility contains operations-related and financial covenants, including limits on financial indicators. All of
these covenants were fully met in 2017. In addition, the credit agreement includes covenants that may
restrict, condition or prohibit the Group from incurring additional debt, making acquisitions, disposing of
assets, making capital and finance lease expenditures, allowing assets to be encumbered, changing the
scope of the Group’s business and entering into a merger agreement.

In 2017, Intrum Justitia AB issued public bonds for approximately EUR 3,000 M, divided into four tranches
of a total of EUR 2,700 M and SEK 3,000 M, compared with EUR 160 M in the preceding year, and
accordingly has outstanding bond loans totaling SEK 33,052 M (4,783). The bonds issued in 2017 have

**Note 23: Borrowing (continued)**

an average interest rate of 2.85 percent and an average maturity of 5.6 years. In 2017, Intrum Justitia also
issued a commercial paper that, at the end of the year, amounted to SEK 2,269 M (1,077).

**Pledged assets**

Pledged collateral includes deposits and restricted bank balances that can be claimed by clients,
suppliers or authorities in the event that Intrum were not to meet its contractual obligations.

**Note 25: Pledged assets, contingent assets and contingent liabilities (continued)**

Pledged collateral also includes shares in subsidiaries within the Group pledged as collateral for the
Parent Company’s revolving credit facility. The reported value of pledged collateral in the table above
refers to the consolidated value of the subsidiaries’ net assets.

**Payment guarantees**

The Group offers services whereby clients, against payment, obtain a guarantee from Intrum regarding
the clients’ receivables from their customers. This entails a risk being incurred that Intrum must
compensate the customer for the guaranteed amount in the event that the invoices are not paid on time.
In those cases where the guarantee comes into play, Intrum assumes the client’s claim against its
customer and takes over the continued handling of the case within the Portfolio Investments area of
operations. At the end of the year, the total guarantee amount amounted to SEK 111 M (124). Intrum’s
risk in this business is managed through strict credit limits and analyses of the borrower’s credit status. As
of year-end Intrum had allocated SEK 1 M (1) in the balance sheet to cover payments that may arise due
to the guarantee.

**Other**

In 2012, when Intrum acquired the Dutch company Buckaroo BV, a supplementary purchase
consideration to the sellers was agreed that would be based on the results achieved by the Company
during the period 2012–2014. Only part of the supplementary purchase consideration has been paid. In
2015, the sellers initiated legal proceedings, bringing claims against Intrum and some of its executives,
demanding payment of additional purchase consideration. These demands are motivated by claims that
the actions of Intrum (and its executives) caused a worse result in Buckaroo than expected, and thus a
lower supplementary purchase consideration. Although Intrum divested the shares in Buckaroo in 2017,
the claim on Intrum from the previous owners remains. Intrum refutes all of these demands and has not
made any provisions with regard to these disputes.

In the Netherlands, there is also a dispute between Intrum and a telecom company regarding accounts
receivable acquired from that company, where Intrum’s ability to collect on the receivables has been
hampered by a ruling by the Supreme Court of the Netherlands, combined with shortcomings in some of
the telecom company’s customer agreements. Intrum has partially withheld payment for the purchased
accounts receivable and has submitted a claim for compensation. The case has been referred to an
arbitration panel for a ruling. There is also a risk that former creditors will demand payment.

In Spain, a number of disputes are currently in progress in both higher and lower level courts against two
former executives, attributable to their termination in June 2015. The disputes concern whether the
dismissals were unlawful, the former executives’ entitlement to different bonuses and the entitlement to
compensation for one of the former executives for a competition commitment in his employment contract.
The relevant courts are expected to announce their rulings on the cases in 2018. Intrum refutes all of
these claims. The potential impact on consolidated earnings is not considered to be material.

In Poland, a dispute is currently in progress related to the acquisition of Casus Finanse SA in 2015. The
dispute concerns the entitlement of the sellers, the former management of Casus Finanse SA, to an
additional purchase consideration and remuneration for continued employment under the share transfer
agreement. The former management of Casus Finanse SA was dismissed in December 2016, and
Intrum’s position is that no entitlement to an additional purchase consideration nor remuneration for
continued employment applies. The dispute has been referred to an arbitration board, which is expected
to announce its ruling in the spring of 2018. Intrum has made no provision with regard to this dispute, and
the potential impact on consolidated earnings is not considered to be material.

In Sweden, the Supreme Court issued a judgment in December 2016 regarding a claim against a private
individual that had been acquired by a financial company. The claim had originally arisen through the sale
of goods to a company that has subsequently been declared bankrupt, and where the private individual
liable for the claim has been a member of the Board. According to the Supreme Court, the private
individual is not liable to the finance company for the portion of the claim relating to VAT, since the
company that originally sold the goods had recovered the VAT from the Swedish Tax Agency. The best
assessment within Intrum and the industry is that the judgment cannot be applied generally to the type of

F-175

receivables that the Group acquires. In all events, the possible impact on consolidated earnings is not
considered to be material.

The Group is otherwise involved in disputes in the normal course of business. In the opinion of the Board,
none of these disputes are expected to give rise to any significant cost.

Note 28.

**Note 28: Terms and conditions of employment for senior executives**

**Guidelines on compensation for senior executives**

The 2017 Annual General Meeting adopted guidelines for remuneration to senior executives, the CEO
and members of Group Management. The proposal has been prepared by the Board and its
Remuneration Committee.

_Salary and remuneration philosophy_

Intrum is dependent on its employees to achieve ambitious objectives in a challenging environment. The
salary and remuneration philosophy seeks to ensure our employees are rewarded for their valuable
contributions to the Company. In addition, behaviors and accomplishments are encouraged and
promoted that best support the Group’s business strategies and ensure that the Group can attract the
skills needed to be successful.

Remuneration levels should reflect the individual’s competence, responsibility and performance, and
should be competitive compared with similar companies in similar sectors in the same geographic area.
To ensure that appropriate behaviors are encouraged, and that efforts are focused in the appropriate
areas, remuneration levels need to be related to the objectives closely associated with the Group’s
business strategy and its core values.

The total remuneration is based on four principal components: base salary, short- and long-term variable
salary programs and pension benefits. Other benefits, such as a company car, may be offered as well.

The base salary depends on the complexity of the work and the individual’s performance and
competence.

_Short-term variable salary_

Short-term variable salary is linked mainly to financial targets and rewards short-term performance by
being fixed for a year at a time. The metrics are set individually for each member of Group Management to
reflect the Group’s business strategy and priorities. The metrics reflect business targets or other
generation of value for the Company. Short-term variable salary means that the Company’s expenses
vary alongside the Group’s financial development and the employees’ individual performance.

Short-term variable salary is capped at 50 percent of fixed annual salary for the CEO and at between 20
and 50 percent for other members of Group Management.

F-177


-----

**Note 28: Terms and conditions of employment for senior executives (continued)**

_Long-term variable salary_

Through the long-term variable salary program, Group Management’s long-term interests and
perspectives are brought onto an equal footing with those of shareholders, while commitment to the
Company is also reinforced. This encourages the long-term generation of value over a three-year period,
allowing Group Management to participate financially in the Company’s success. Growth in Intrum’s
earnings per share is generally applied as a metric because this is considered a good indicator of the
Group’s long-term success. As with short-term salary, an effect of the program’s design is that the cost
varies alongside the Group’s financial performance.

Long-term variable salary is capped at 50 percent of fixed annual salary for the CEO and at between 20
and 50 percent for other members of Group Management.

_Costs_

For 2017, expenses for variable salary programs to the CEO and other members of Group Management
are expected to amount to at most SEK 11 M for the short-term program and at most SEK 10.2 M for the
long-term program, excluding social security contributions. The estimate does not take into account any
changes due to the merger with Lindorff, which may affect, for example, the composition of Group
Management and its fixed and variable salaries.

_Guidelines for individual share ownership_

To further encourage shareholder-like behavior and commitment among Group Management, there is an
expectation of individual share ownership that directly links the individual remuneration of members of
Group Management to the Company’s development. This means that each member of the Group
Management is expected to own shares in Intrum equivalent to a certain percentage of their fixed annual
salary before taxes—100 percent for the President and 50 percent for other members of Group
Management. Share ownership should persist as long as these individuals remain employees and
members of Group Management.

Guidelines for share ownership were introduced in 2015, and each person has had a certain amount of
time (based on individual agreements) to acquire shares.

_Other_

In the event of termination by Intrum, a maximum of 12 months’ severance pay shall apply (if at all).

The Board of Directors shall have the right to depart from these remuneration guidelines if there is
particular justification for doing so in individual cases.

**Role of the Remuneration Committee**

The Board of Directors has a Remuneration Committee whose task is to address the Group’s
remuneration issues on behalf of shareholders and the Board. The Remuneration Committee is
responsible for preparing the Group’s remuneration guidelines, which include general principles for how
salaries and other remunerations are determined, as well as addressing remuneration issues concerning
the CEO and Group Management. The Remuneration Committee comprises three Board members.
Since the 2017 Annual General Meeting, the Remuneration Committee has consisted of Per E. Larsson
(Chairman) and Fredrik Tr¨ag˚ardh. The CEO and the Company’s Chief Human Resources Officer are
co-opted to the Committee’s meetings, though not when their own remuneration is discussed.

**Terms of employment and remuneration of the CEO**

During 2017, Mikael Ericson, CEO and President, received remuneration in accordance with the Group’s
principles as detailed above. His fixed monthly salary during the period January–June amounted to
SEK 428,400 and during July–December to SEK 500,000. In addition, he had the opportunity to receive
variable compensation up to 100 percent of his base salary, 50 percent within the framework of the
short-term variable salary program and 50 percent within the framework of the 2014 long-term
remuneration program, in proportion to his period of employment. In addition to his salary, the Company
paid pension contributions corresponding to 35 percent of his fixed annual salary. The pension policy is a

**Note 28: Terms and conditions of employment for senior executives (continued)**

defined contribution plan and the retirement age is 65 years. He also had a company car in accordance
with the Group’s car policy, as well as subsidized meals under the same terms as other Group employees
in Sweden.

Lars Wollung left his position as President and CEO in early November 2015, in accordance with a
decision by the Board of Directors, and he thus received salary during the period of notice, as well as
severance pay, as set out in the employment agreement. In 2017, disbursements have been made in
accordance with the provisions made in 2015.

**Terms of employment and remuneration for other members of Group Management**

During 2017, other members of Group Management also had benefit levels in accordance with the
Group’s principles as detailed described above. This includes their fixed annual salary and the
opportunity to receive variable remuneration of up to 100 percent of their annual salary, of which
20–50 percent was under the short-term remuneration program and 20–50 percent under the long-term
remuneration program.

Pension benefits vary from country to country. In several cases, they are included in monthly salaries.
Pension policies are defined contribution plans, and the retirement age is generally 65. Members of
Group Management have company cars, in accordance with the Group’s car policy. Smaller benefits also
occur according to local practice, such as subsidized meals and travel.

During the period November 2015–February 2016, the Group’s Chief Financial Officer, Erik Forsberg,
was the acting CEO and he received a salary supplement totaling SEK 300,000 per month during this
period, in addition to his regular monthly salary in 2016 of SEK 100,000.

In March 2017, certain senior executives, excluding the President and CEO, were offered an additional
bonus, amounting to two months’ salary, linked to the merger between Intrum Justitia and Lindorff.
Provided that predetermined terms are met, the bonus will be paid in March 2018. Variable remuneration
reported below includes exceptional bonus earned by year-end 2017.

The notice of termination for members of Group Management Team varies from three to twelve months,
regardless of whether termination is initiated by the employee or the Company.

**Remuneration for the year**

Other senior executives in the table are defined as members of Group Management (see pages 98–100)
other than the CEO. In June 2017, Group Management changed when six people from the former Lindorff
and one from Intrum Justitia joined while two others stepped down. At the end of 2017, there were 13
other senior executives.

remuneration for each year. This entails, for example, that the variable remuneration accrued and
expensed by the Company in 2016 was disbursed in 2017, while the variable remuneration for 2017 was
disbursed in 2018.

No share-based remunerations were paid in 2016 or 2017.

**Board of Directors**

In accordance with the Annual General Meeting’s resolution, total fees paid to Board members for the
year, including for committee work, amounted to SEK 5,395 thousand (3,715). Board fees are distributed
between Directors as determined by the AGM according to the proposal of the Nomination Committee.
The Directors have no pension benefits or severance agreements.

Meeting and from the 2017 Annual General Meeting until the 2018 Annual General Meeting respectively.
Some members of the Board of Directors issue invoices for their fees through their own companies, in
which case those invoices include social security expenses and VAT.

**Note 30: Operational leasing (continued)**

Lease costs for operating leases amounted to SEK 192 M (131) during the year, of which
SEK 2 M (2) were in the Parent Company.

Operating leasing primarily refers to offices for the Group’s operations in its countries. No single lease is
of material significance to the Group in terms of amount.

The only financial instruments that are regularly restated at fair value are derivatives (e.g. forward
exchange contracts). They are valued based on a valuation technique that uses observable market data
and thus falls under Level 2 in the valuation hierarchy according to IFRS 13.

Financial assets include the balance sheet items: purchased debt, other long-term receivables, accounts
receivable, client funds, other current receivables, accrued income, derivatives with positive value, cash
and cash equivalents and, for the Parent Company, intra-Group receivables.

The total recognized value of consolidated financial assets amounted to SEK 25,212 M (10,692) on the
balance sheet date. Financial assets classified as loan receivables and accounts receivable amounted to
SEK 25,000 M (10,678) and financial assets recognized at fair value via the income statement amounted
to SEK 212 M (14).

The total recognized value of the Parent Company’s financial assets amounted to SEK 34,934 M (6,714)
on the balance sheet date. Financial assets classified as loan receivables and accounts receivable
amounted to SEK 34,722 M (6,700) and financial assets recognized at fair value via the income statement
amounted to SEK 212 M (14).

Financial liabilities include the balance sheet items: non-current and current liabilities to credit institutions,
bond loans, commercial papers, client funds payable, accounts payable, advances from clients, other
current liabilities, accrued expenses, prepaid income and, for the Parent Company, intra-Group liabilities.

The total recognized value of consolidated financial assets amounted to SEK 42,168 M (9,252) on the
balance sheet date. Financial liabilities recognized at amortized cost amounted to SEK 42,113 M (9,239)
and financial liabilities recognized at fair value amounted to SEK 55 M (13).

The total recognized value of the Parent Company’s financial liabilities amounted to SEK 43,417 M
(11,723) on the balance sheet date. Financial liabilities recognized at amortized cost amounted to
SEK 43,362 M (11,710) and financial liabilities recognized at fair value amounted to SEK 55 M (13).

**Note 33: Financial instruments (continued)**

_Purchased debt_

Purchased debt is classified as loan receivables and recognized at amortized cost according to an
effective interest method. The Group determines the carrying value by calculating the present value of
estimated future cash flows at the receivables’ original effective interest rate. Adjustments are recognized
in the income statement. With this valuation method, the carrying value is the best estimate of the fair
value of debt portfolios, in the Company’s opinion. On the balance sheet date, the recognized value of
purchased debt amounted to SEK 21,149 M (8,733). An account of purchased debt by year acquired is
provided in Note 34.

_Accounts receivable_

Accounts receivable are recognized at amortized cost with no discount being applied since the remaining
maturity is judged to be short. Accounts receivable amounted to SEK 755 M (305) on the balance sheet
date.

_Other receivables_

Other receivables have short maturities. Receivables in foreign currency are translated in the accounts at
balance sheet date rates. Consequently, carrying value corresponds to fair value. Other receivables,
including accrued income, amounted to SEK 2,427 M (1,259) on the balance sheet date. The item
includes derivatives valued at SEK 212 M (14), which are classified as assets measured at fair value in
the income statement (held for sale). The remaining SEK 2,215 M (1,245) is classified as loan
receivables. For the Parent Company, other receivables, including receivables from Group companies,
amounted to SEK 34,839 M (6,707). The item includes derivatives valued at SEK 212 M (14), which are
classified as assets measured at fair value in the income statement (held for sale). The remaining SEK
34,627 M (6,693) is classified as loan receivables.

_Liquid assets_

Liquid assets mainly consist of bank balances. Liquid assets in foreign currency are translated in the
accounts at balance sheet date rates. Consequently, carrying value corresponds to fair value. Cash and
bank balances are classified as loan receivables and amounted at year-end to SEK 881 M (396). For the
Parent Company, the corresponding amount was SEK 95 M (8) on the balance sheet date.

_Liabilities to credit institutions_

The Parent Company’s and the Group’s loan liabilities carry market rate interest with short fixed interest
terms. Liabilities in foreign currency are translated in the accounts at balance sheet date rates.
Consequently, carrying value corresponds to fair value. On the balance sheet date, consolidated
liabilities to credit institutions amounted to SEK 2,703 M (1,576) and for the Parent Company, they
amounted to SEK 2,694 M (1,576).

_Bond loan_

The Parent Company and the Group had bond loans outstanding for a value of SEK 33,052 M (4,783) on
the balance sheet date. The bond loans are carried at amortized cost. The fair value of the bonds, based
on observable market data, was SEK 33,408 M (4,783).

_Commercial papers_

The Parent Company and the Group had commercial papers outstanding for a value of SEK 2,269 M
(1,124) on the balance sheet date.

_Accounts payable_

Accounts payable have short maturities. Liabilities in foreign currency are translated in the accounts at
balance sheet date rates. Consequently, carrying value corresponds to fair value. Consolidated accounts
payable amounted to SEK 572 M (140). For the Parent Company, the equivalent amount was SEK 53
(10).

F-182


-----

**Note 33: Financial instruments (continued)**

_Other liabilities_

The Parent Company’s and the Group’s other liabilities have short maturities. Liabilities in foreign
currency are translated in the accounts at balance sheet date rates. Consequently, carrying value
corresponds to fair value. Other liabilities, including accrued expenses amounted to SEK 3,572 M on the
balance sheet date (1,629). The item includes derivatives valued at SEK 55 M (13), recognized at fair
value in the income statement (held for sale). Other liabilities, excluding derivatives amounted to SEK
3,517 M (1,616).

For the Parent Company, other liabilities amounted to SEK 5,348 M (4,230) on the balance sheet date
and included liabilities to Group companies and accrued expenses. Derivatives are recognized at fair
value in the income statement (held for sale) and amounted to SEK 55 M (13). Other liabilities, excluding
derivatives amounted to SEK 5,293 M (4,217).

_Offset of financial instruments_

Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value comprise derivatives. Financial assets and liabilities
are not offset in the balance sheet. However, there are legally binding agreements that allow offsetting
should one of the counterparties for the Group’s derivatives suspend their payments. At the end of the
year, Intrum had financial assets totaling SEK 50 M (2) that could be offset against debts should the
counterparties suspend their payments.

**Note 34: Financial risks and financial policies**

**Principles of financing and financial risk management**

The financial risks that arise in Intrum operations are limited. Thanks to a strong cash flow, combined with
little need for investment and operating capital, external capital needs in the Group’s Credit Management
operations are relatively low. The purchased debt operations have a greater need for capital, particularly
during a growth phase.

Intrum’s financing and financial risks are managed within the Group in accordance with the treasury policy
established by the Board of Directors. The treasury policy contains rules for managing financial activities,
delegating responsibility, measuring and identifying financial risks and limiting these risks.

Internal and external financial operations are concentrated in Group Treasury in Stockholm, which
ensures economies of scale when pricing financial transactions. Because Group Treasury can take
advantage of temporary surpluses and deficits in the Group’s various countries of operation, the Group’s
total interest expense can be minimized.

**Market risk**

Market risk consists of risks related to changes in exchange rates and interest rate levels.

_Exchange rate risk_

Exchange rate risk is the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates will negatively affect the Group’s income
statement, balance sheet and/or cash flows. The most important currencies for the Intrum Group, other
than the Swedish krona (SEK), are the euro (EUR), the Swiss franc (CHF), the Hungarian forint (HUF),
the Danish krone (DKK) and the Norwegian krone (NOK).

The following exchange rates have been used to translate transactions in foreign currency in the financial
accounts:

**Note 34: Financial risks and financial policies (continued)**

Exchange rate risk can be divided into transaction exposure and translation exposure. Transaction
exposure consists of net operating and financial receipts and disbursements in different currencies.
Translation exposure consists of the effects from the translation of the financial reports of foreign
subsidiaries and associated companies to SEK.

_Transaction exposure_

In each country, all income and most operating expenses are denominated in local currencies, and thus
currency fluctuations have only a limited impact on the Company’s operating earnings in local currency.
National operations seldom have receivables and liabilities in foreign currency. Income and expenses in
national currency are thereby hedged in a natural way, which limits transaction exposure. The currency
exposure that arises within the operating activities is limited to the extent it pertains to international
collection operations. The subsidiaries’ projected flow exposure is not hedged at present. All major known
currency flows are hedged on a continuous basis in the Group and the Parent Company through forward
exchange contracts.

_Translation exposure_

Intrum operates in 24 countries. The results and financial position of subsidiaries are reported in the
relevant foreign currencies and later translated into SEK for inclusion in the consolidated financial
statements. Consequently, fluctuations in the SEK exchange rate affect consolidated income and
earnings, as well as equity and other items in the financial statements.

The Group’s revenues are distributed by currency as follows:

**SEK M** **2017** **2016**

SEK . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 878 886

An appreciation of the Swedish krona of 10 percentage points on average in 2017 against EUR would
thus, all else being equal, have affected revenues by SEK�528 M, against CHF by SEK�73 M, against
HUF by SEK�78 M, against DKK by SEK�34 M and against NOK by SEK�76 M.

In terms of net assets by currency, shareholders’ equity in the Group, including non-controlling interests,
is distributed as follows:

**Note 34: Financial risks and financial policies (continued)**

All else being equal, an appreciation in the Swedish krona of 10 percentage points as per December 31,
2017 against EUR would have affected shareholders’ equity in the Group by SEK�724 M, against CHF
by SEK�70 M, against DKK by SEK�174 M, against HUF by SEK�68 M and against NOK by
SEK�670 M.

Regarding the currency risk attributable to currency interest rate swaps, see the description below under
Interest rate risks.

_Interest rate risks_

Interest rate risks relate primarily to the Group’s interest-bearing net debt, which amounted to
SEK 37,322 M (7,260) on December 31, 2017. The loan rate is tied to the market rate.

Intrum has a strong cash flow which gives the Group the option of repaying loans or investing in portfolios.
The Group’s loans have a fixed interest term—currently about 39 months (8) for the entire loan portfolio.

A one-percent increase in market interest rates would have adversely affected net financial items by
approximately SEK 223 M. A five-percent increase would have adversely affected net financial items by
SEK 1,115 M.

To establish an appropriate matching of currencies in the balance sheet and thus manage the currency
risk between assets and liabilities, the Company uses currency interest rate swaps in which the Parent
Company for example swaps liabilities in SEK and receives EUR at the same rate on both the start and
maturity dates. In this way, the Company can maintain the desired level of hedging of shareholders’
equity per currency while also maintaining an interest rate exposure in the same currency.

**Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk of a loss or higher-than-expected costs to ensure the Group’s ability to fulfill its
short and long-term payment obligations to outside parties.

The Group’s long-term financing risk is limited by confirmed loan facilities. The Group’s objective is that at
least 35 percent of total committed loans have a remaining maturity of at least three years and that not
more than 35 percent of the total have a remaining maturity of less than 12 months.

On June 16, 2017, Intrum Justitia AB signed a 4.5-year revolving syndicated loan facility of a total
EUR 1,100 M with a bank consortium of five Nordic banks to replace the previous facility from 2015 and to
support the merged company’s liquidity needs and meet future investment opportunities. The loan
framework of EUR 1,100 M can be utilized for borrowing in a number of different currencies. On
December 31, 2017, the loan framework had been utilized for loans in SEK totaling SEK 700 M (0), in
EUR totaling EUR 100 M (15), in GBP totaling EUR 102 M (0), in PLN totaling PLN 0 M (240) and in HUF
totaling HUF 0 M (28,300). The unutilized portion of the facilities amounted to SEK 8,008 M (5,964). The
loan carries a variable interest rate based on the interbank rate in each currency, with a margin. The loan
facility contains operations-related and financial covenants, including limits on financial indicators. All of
these covenants were fully met in 2017. In addition, the credit agreement includes covenants that may
restrict, condition or prohibit the Group from incurring additional debt, making acquisitions, disposing of
assets, making capital and finance lease expenditures, allowing assets to be encumbered, changing the
scope of the Group’s business and entering into a merger agreement.

During 2017, Intrum Justitia AB issued public bonds for approximately EUR 3,000 M, divided into four
tranches of a total EUR 2,700 M and SEK 3,000 M, compared with EUR 160 M last year and thus has
bond loans outstanding for a total SEK 33,052 M (4,706).

In 2017, Intrum also issued a commercial paper that, at the end of the year, amounted to SEK 2,269 M
(1,077).

The Group’s aim is that the liquidity reserve, which consists of cash, bank balances and short-term liquid
investments should amount to at least SEK 100 M more than the unutilized portion of committed lines of
credit. The Group has deposited its liquid assets with established financial institutions where the risk of
loss is considered remote. The Group’s finance function prepares regular liquidity forecasts with the
purpose of optimizing the balance between loans and liquid funds so that the net interest expense is
minimized without, for that matter, incurring difficulties in meeting external commitments.

**Credit risks**

Credit risk consists of the risk that Intrum’s counterparties are unable to fulfill their obligations to the
Group.

Financial assets that potentially subject the Group to credit risk include cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, purchased debt, outlays on behalf of clients, derivatives and guarantees. For
financial assets owned by Intrum, no collateral or other credit reinforcements have been received. The
maximum credit exposure for each class of financial assets therefore corresponds to the carrying amount.

_Liquid assets_

The Group’s cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of bank balances and other short-term financial
assets with a remaining maturity of less than three months. The Group has deposited its liquid assets with
established banks where the risk of loss is considered remote.

F-186


-----

**Note 34: Financial risks and financial policies (continued)**

_Accounts receivable_

The Group’s accounts receivable from clients and debtors in various industries, and are not concentrated
in a specific geographical region. The Group’s largest client accounts for less than two percent of
revenues. Most accounts receivable outstanding are with customers previously known to the Group and
whose creditworthiness is good. For an analysis of accounts receivable by age, see Note 16.

_Portfolio investments_

As part of its portfolio investment operations, Intrum acquires portfolios of consumer receivables and tries
to collect them. Unlike its conventional collection operations where Intrum works on behalf of clients in
return for commissions and fees, in this case it assumes all the rights and risks associated with the
receivables. The portfolios are purchased at prices significantly below their nominal value, and Intrum
retains the entire amount it collects, including interest and fees.

The acquired receivables are overdue and in many cases are from debtors who are having payment
problems. It is obvious, therefore, that the entire nominal amount of the receivable will not be recovered.
On the other hand, the receivables are acquired at prices significantly below their nominal value. The risk
in this business is that Intrum, at the time of acquisition, overestimates its ability to collect the amounts or
underestimates the costs of collection. The maximum theoretical risk is of course that the entire carrying
value of SEK 21,149 M (8,733) would become worthless and have to be written off.

To minimize the risks in this business, prudence is exercised in purchase decisions. The focus is on small
and medium-sized portfolios with relatively low average amounts, to help spread risks. The average
nominal value per case is approximately SEK 12,210. Portfolios are normally acquired from customers
with whom the Group has had a long-term relationship. The acquisitions have generally consisted of
unsecured debt, requiring relatively less capital and significantly simplifying administration compared with
collateralized receivables. During 2016–2017, however, Intrum has also begun to acquire portfolios with
underlying collateral, usually in the form of property mortgages. Intrum places high yield requirements on
the portfolios it acquires. Before every acquisition, a careful assessment is made based on a projection of
future cash flows (collected amount) from the portfolio. In these calculations Intrum benefits from its
extensive experience in debt collection and from the Group’s scoring methods. Intrum therefore believes
that it has the expertise required to evaluate these types of receivables. To enable acquisitions of larger
portfolios at attractive risk levels, Intrum has, on occasion, partnered with other companies such as
CarVal, Cr´edit Agricole, Goldman Sachs and East Capital to share the capital investment and return.

The currency risk is attributable to the translation of the balance sheet item Portfolio investments is limited
due to currency hedging using loans in the same currency as the assets, and currency forwards. A
considerable proportion of purchased debt acquisitions take place through forward flow agreements—
that is, Intrum may have previously agreed with a company to acquire all of that company’s accounts
receivable at a certain percentage of their nominal value once they are overdue by a certain number of
days. In most of these agreements, however, Intrum has the opportunity to decline to acquire the
receivables if, for example, their quality decreases.

Risks are diversified by acquiring receivables from clients in different sectors and different countries. The
Group’s purchased debt portfolios include debtors in 21 countries. The Group’s total carrying amount for
purchased debt is distributed as follows:

#### By country

Germany, % 14 (3)
Norway, %
Spain, %

13 (1)

Sweden, % 40 (62)

16JUL201909141303

Of the total carrying value on the balance sheet date, 35 percent represents portfolio acquisitions in 2017,
19 percent acquisitions in 2016, 16 percent acquisitions in 2015 and 9 percent acquisitions in 2014. The
remaining 21 percent relates to receivables acquired in or before 2013, which have therefore been past
due for more than four years. In the case of a large share of the oldest receivables, Intrum has reached
agreement with the debtors on payment plans.

_Outlays on behalf of clients_

As an element in its operations, the Group incurs outlays for court fees, legal representation, enforcement
authorities, etc., which can be charged to and collected from debtors. In many cases Intrum has
agreements with its clients whereby any expenses that cannot be collected from debtors are instead
refunded by the client. The amount that is expected to be recovered from a solvent counterparty is
recognized as an asset in the balance sheet on the line Other receivables.

_Derivative contracts_

The Parent Company and the Group hold forward exchange contracts and currency exchange swaps to a
limited extent. The credit risk in the Group’s forward exchange contracts is because the counterparty
generally is a large bank or financial institution that is not expected to become insolvent. On the balance
sheet date, assets regarding forward exchange contracts were valued at SEK 212 M (14), and liabilities at
SEK 55 M (13). See Note 33 regarding the possibility of offsetting receivables and liabilities for derivative
contracts.

The contracts have short maturities, typically one or more months. All outstanding forward exchange
contracts are restated at fair value in the accounts, with adjustments recognized in the income statement.
The purpose of these forward exchange contracts has been to minimize exchange rate differences in the
Parent Company attributable to receivables and liabilities in foreign currency. The net effect through profit
or loss of exchange rate differences attributable to receivables and liabilities as well as forward exchange
contracts is SEK�1 M (�4).

Outstanding forward exchange contracts at year end in the Parent Company and in the Group comprise
the following currencies:

**Local currency** **Hedged amount, buy** **Hedged amount, sell**

The Parent Company and the Group also hold currency interest rate swaps that were signed in
connection with the Parent Company’s issue of bonds in SEK. To achieve suitable currency matching
between assets and liabilities, liabilities in SEK were exchanged to EUR at the same rate on the starting
date and the date of maturity.

**Note 34: Financial risks and financial policies (continued)**

_Payment guarantees_

The Group offers services whereby clients, against payment, obtain a guarantee from Intrum regarding
the clients’ receivables from their customers. This entails a risk being incurred that Intrum must
compensate the customer for the guaranteed amount in the event that the invoices are not paid on time.
In those cases where the guarantee comes into play, Intrum assumes the client’s claim against its
customer and takes over the continued handling of the case within the Portfolio Investments area of
operations. At the end of the year, the total guarantee amount amounted to SEK 111 M (124). Intrum’s
risk in this business is managed through strict credit limits and analyses of the borrower’s credit status. As
of year-end Intrum had allocated SEK 1 M (1) in the balance sheet to cover payments that may arise due
to the guarantee.

**Note 35: Acquisitions and divestments**

On June 12, 2017, the EU Commission approved the merger of Intrum Justitia and Lindorff. The approval
was conditional on the divestment of Lindorff’s operations in Denmark, Estonia, Finland and Sweden, and
of Intrum Justitia’s operations in Norway. On June 27, the merger was effectuated and Lock TopCo AS
(the parent company of the Lindorff Group) with all of its subsidiaries have since been owned by Intrum
Justitia AB (publ)

The merger was effectuated through a non-cash issue whereby Intrum Justitia AB issued 59,193,594 new
Intrum Justitia shares, with a total market value of SEK 17,332 M, in exchange for all shares in Lock
TopCo AS. In connection with the issue, a prospectus was published and this is available on Intrum’s
website.

In connection with th merger, the rules in IFRS 3 about reverse acquisitions were evaluated, but the
conclusion was that the transaction should be accounted for as an ordinary acquisition.

Lindorff has been consolidated effective from July 1, 2017, contributing to consolidated revenues by
SEK 3,520 M and to net earnings by SEK 335 M. If the acquisition would have been executed by
January 1, it would have contributed to consolidated revenues by SEK 7,012 M and to net earnings by
SEK 165 M. Se also Note 40.

Although the preliminary acquisition analysis prepared by Intrum Justitia at the time of the acquisition has
been adjusted in connection with the annual accounts, it remains preliminary:

_Other acquisitions in 2016_

In April the acquisition was completed of a small credit management company in Belgium, C&J Credit
Services BVBA, for a purchase consideration of SEK 13 M. Consolidated goodwill amounted to
SEK 15 M. C&J Services merged with Intrum NV on June 30, 2016.

**Note 36: Critical estimates and assumptions**

To be able to prepare the accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices,
company management and the Board of Directors must make assessments and assumptions that affect
reported income and expense items, asset and liability items, as well as other disclosures. Management
has discussed with the Audit Committee the Group’s critical accounting principles and estimates as well
as the application of these.

Estimates and assumptions are continuously assessed on the basis of historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events considered reasonable under prevailing conditions.
Actual outcomes may vary from the assessments made.

The areas in which estimates and assumptions could entail significant risk of adjustment in the
recognized amounts for assets and liabilities in future fiscal years are primarily the following:

**Impairment testing of goodwill**

As indicated in Note 10, an impairment test of goodwill was done prior to the preparation of the annual
accounts. The geographical regions are judged to achieve a sufficient degree of integration that they form
combined cash generating units. Recoverable amounts for cash generating units have been established
by calculating their value in use. The assumptions and assessments made with regard to expected cash
flows and discount rates in the form of weighted average cost of capital, as well as a sensitivity analysis
are detailed in Note 10. Projections of future cash flows are based on the best possible assessments of
future income and operating expenses.

**Portfolio investments**

As indicated in Note 14, the recognition of portfolio investments in overdue receivables is based on the
Company’s own projection of future cash flows from the acquired portfolios. Although the Company has
historically had good projection accuracy with regard to cash flows, future deviations cannot be ruled out.

The Group applies internal rules and a formalized decision-making process in the adjustment of
previously established cash flow projections. These entail, among other things, that cash flow projections
are only in exceptional cases adjusted in the first year of ownership of a portfolio. Furthermore, the
decision to amend a cash flow projection is preceded by a discussion between the local management in
the country in question and the management of the service line. All changes in cash flow projections are
ultimately decided on by a central revaluation committee.

**Sales of portfolio investments**

The Group has occasionally sold certain portfolios of purchased debt. Divestments of portfolios are not
included in the business model for this asset category. Intrum has assessed the transactions and
concluded that a sale of purchased debt should be recognized in the same way as if an amount equivalent
to the selling price had been collected as part of normal operations. For Intrum’s accounting, it does not
matter if the same amount is received through collection from debtors or by sale to an external party. The
entire sale price for the portfolios sold has been reported as the amount collected on purchased debt, and
the entire carrying value remaining prior to the sale has been reported as amortization of purchased debt.

**Useful lifetimes of intangible and tangible fixed assets**

Group Management establishes assessed useful lifetimes and thus consistent amortization and
depreciation for the Group’s intangible and tangible fixed assets. These estimates are based on historical
knowledge of equivalent assets’ useful lifetimes. Useful lifetimes and estimated residual values are tested
on each balance sheet date and adjusted when necessary. Recognized values for each balance sheet
date for intangible and tangible fixed assets, see Notes 10 and 11.

**Note 36: Critical estimates and assumptions (continued)**

**Assessment of deferred tax assets**

Deferred tax assets for tax-loss carryforwards or other future tax deductions are recognized to the extent
it is deemed likely that the deduction can be made against future taxable surpluses. Carrying amounts for
deferred tax assets on each balance sheet date are provided in Note 8.

**Reporting of Polish investment fund**

The Group has operated in Poland since 2006 through investment funds designed for the purchasing and
holding of portfolio investments. From the Group’s perspective, the funds function in practice as a
subsidiary. Against this backdrop, Intrum has resolved to consolidate the investment funds as a
subsidiary in the consolidated financial statements.

**Acquisition of Lindorff**

On June 27, 2017, Lock TopCo AS (‘‘Lindorff’’) was acquired by Intrum Justitia AB (‘‘Intrum’’) through a
non-cash issue whereby new shares in Intrum were issued as payment for the shares in Lindorff. The
acquisition and acquisition analysis are described in Note 35. Intrum has evaluated Lindorff’s accounting
policies and the fair values of assets and liabilities in the acquisition. The acquisition is large and complex,
and the acquisition analysis may be adjusted in upcoming quarters.

**Note 37: Related parties**

In addition to associated companies and joint ventures, related parties include the Board of Directors and
senior executives, according to Note 28, as well as close family members to these executives and other
companies over which they can exert a significant influence.

All transactions with related parties are conducted on market terms and at arm’s length.

In 2017, Intrum purchased services for SEK 1 M (2) from Caperio AB, an IT company in which Per-Henrik
Persson (who was the country manager for Intrum in Sweden for part of the year) is a Board member.

**Return on portfolio investments**

The return on portfolio investments represents the service line’s earnings for the year, excluding services
such as factoring and payment guarantees, as a percentage of the average carrying amount of the
balance-sheet item overdue receivables. The ratio sets the service line’s earnings in relation to the
amount of capital tied up and is included in the Group’s financial targets.

**EBITDA**

Operating earnings before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) are operating earnings after reversal
of depreciation of fixed assets except portfolio investments.

**CASH EBITDA**

Cash EBITDA is operating earnings after depreciation on fixed assets as well as amortization and
revaluations of portfolio investments are added back.

**Non-recurring items (NRIs)**

Significant earnings items that are not included in the Group’s normal recurring operations and that are
not expected to return on a regular basis. Non-recurring items include restructuring costs, closure costs,
reversal of restructuring or closure reservations, cost savings programs, integration costs, extraordinary
projects, divestments, impairment of non-current fixed assets other than portfolio investments,

acquisition and divestment expenses, advisory costs for discontinued acquisition projects, costs for
relocation to new office space, termination and recruitment costs for members of Group Management and
country managers, as well as external expenses for disputes and unusual agreements. Non-recurring
items are specified because they are difficult to predict and have low forecast values for the Group’s
future earnings trend.

**EBIT, EBITDA AND cash EBITDA, excluding NRIs**

In accordance with the above, the key figures EBIT, EBITDA and Cash EBITDA are also reported after
recurring non-recurring items, NRIs.

**Net debt**

Net debt is interest-bearing liabilities and pension provisions less liquid assets and interest-bearing
receivables.

**Note 39: Discontinued operations and assets and liabilities in operations held for sale**

The merger between Intrum Justitia and Lindorff was implemented on June 27, 2017.

In connection with the merger, Intrum Justitia has undertaken to the European Commission to divest its
Norwegian subsidiaries, as well as Lindorff’s Swedish, Finnish, Danish and Estonian subsidiaries. In
November, Intrum agreed to divest these subsidiaries to a company in the Lowell Group. At the end of the
year, the sale transaction had not been finalized pending requisite official permits, among other things.

In the income statement, the subsidiaries being divested in accordance with the above are reported in
accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations as discontinued
operations, with the comparative figures for previous years being recalculated. In the balance sheet,
these subsidiaries are reported as assets and liabilities in operations held for sale, without the
comparative figures being recalculated.

Summary income statements for the discontinued operations are presented below:

The Board of Directors’ complete statement motivating the proposed disposition of earnings for the 2017
fiscal year will be presented in a separate document prior to the 2018 Annual General Meeting. It
concludes, among other things, that the proposed dividend is in line with the Company’s dividend policy
and that the Board, having considered the nature, scope and risks of the Company’s operations, as well
as the Company’s and the Group’s consolidation requirements, liquidity and financial position in general,
has found no indications that the proposed dividend is unjustified.

The Board of Directors and the President certify that the Annual Report has been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting standards in Sweden and that the consolidated accounts have been
prepared in accordance with the international accounting standards referred to in
Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 19, 2002 on the
application of international accounting standards.

The annual accounts and consolidated accounts give a true and fair view of the financial position and
results of the Parent Company and the Group. The Board of Directors’ Report for the Parent Company
and the Group gives a true and fair overview of the operations, financial position and results of the Parent
Company and the Group, and describes significant risks and uncertainties that the Parent Company and
the companies in the Group face.

The annual and consolidated accounts were approved for publication by the Board of Directors and the
President on March 28, 2018 and are proposed for approval by the Annual General Meeting on April 27,
2018.
