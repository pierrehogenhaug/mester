Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the ""PRIIPs Regulation"") for offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. Prohibition of sales to United Kingdom retail investors: The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom.

The Interim Financial Statements and the Audited Financial Statements are collectively referred to herein as the “Financial Statements .” _Factors impacting comparability IFRIC Interpretation: Attributing Benefit to Periods of Service (April 2021)_ In April 2021, IFRIC issued an interpretation on IAS 19 Employee Benefits that requires an entity to attribute benefits to periods of service. The period of service starts w hen an entity has an obligation tow ards the employee until the service period w hen additional service does not impact timing or amount of the final benefit. The Group prospectively adopted this interpretation w ith effect from January 1, 2021. Previously, the benefit w as attributable to the full service period and the pension obligation covered all employees. As a result of the interpretation, the pension obligation and service costs are now only computed for employees w ho are at least 46 years old and w ill complete 16 years of continuous service. This has resulted in a reduction in pension obligation from SEK 110 million to SEK 41 million and reduction in service costs of SEK 38 million. Consequently, the retained earnings increased by SEK 38 million and other comprehensive income increased by SEK 30 million. _Other Changes_ The follow ing restatements and presentational changes have been made to the comparative figures for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in the 2021 Financial Statements: ######  ""Reduction of interest paid"" for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in the 2020 Financial Statements, impacting cash flow s from operating activities in the statement of cash flow s, has been restated in the 2021 Financial Statements as ""Borrowing and repayments of loans,"" impacting cash flows from investing activities in the statement of cash flow s. This change resulted in a decrease in ""cash flow _from operating activities"" in an amount of SEK 210 million and a corresponding increase in ""cash flow from financing activities"" of SEK 210 million, in each case for the year ended December 31, 2020, as_ reflected in the 2021 Financial Statements. ###### x ----- ######  In the 2021 Financial Statements, the amortization method for the client servicing assets w as changed from a straight-line method to a diminishing balance method. The impact of this change, as reflected in the 2021 Financial Statements and the Interim Statements, w as SEK 15 million. We believe that the diminishing balance method more accurately depicts the underlying cashflow s. ######  Certain balance sheet line items for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in the 2020 Financial Statements, including ""capitalised expenditure for IT development and other intangibles,"" ""other intangible fixed assets,"" ""total intangible fixed assets,"" ""total fixed assets,"" ""total assets,"" ""Retained earnings including net earnings for the year,"" ""total shareholders' equity attributable to parent company's shareholders,"" ""shareholders' equity attributable to non-controlling interests,"" ""total shareholders' equity,"" ""other long-term liabilities,"" ""total long-term liabilities"" and ""total shareholders' equity and liabilities"" have been restated in the 2021 Financial Statements to more accurately reflect several factors including: intangible assets w rite-offs, a restatement of Aktua's non-controlling interest, Aktua's put/call liability and Solvia's put/call liability. These restatements resulted in (i) net increases in ""total intangible fixed assets"", ""total fixed assets"" and ""total assets"" of SEK 67 million, (ii) a decrease in ""retained earnings including net earnings for the year"" of SEK 440 million, (iii) a decrease in ""total shareholders’ equity attributable to parent company’s shareholders"" of SEK 442 million, (iv) a decrease in ""total shareholders’ equity attributable to noncontrolling interests"" of SEK 70 million, (v) a decrease in ""total shareholders’ equity"" of SEK 372 million, (vi) increases in ""other long term liabilities"" and ""total long term liabilities"" of SEK 439 million and (vii) a net increase in ""total shareholders’ equity and liabilities"" of SEK 67 million, in each case as of December 31, 2020 and as reflected in the 2021 Financial Statements. ######  The presentation of certain income statement line items for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in the 2020 Financial Statements has been modified in the 2021 Financial Statements as follow s: (i) ""provisions for credit losses on accounts receivable"" of negative SEK 69 million in the 2020 Financial Statements is presented under ""sales, marketing and administrative expenses,"" resulting in a corresponding decrease of SEK 69 million thereto, in the 2021 Financial Statements; (ii) ""share of the _profit or loss on joint ventures accounted for using the equity method"" of negative SEK 734 million in the_ 2020 Financial Statements is presented under ""participation in associated companies,"" resulting in a corresponding decrease of SEK 734 million thereto, in the 2021 Financial Statements; and (iii) the line item ""net exchange gains/losses"" of SEK 16 million has been added in the 2021 Financial Statements, resulting in a corresponding decrease of SEK 16 million to ""financial income"" in the 2021 Financial Statements. ######  With effect from January 1, 2022, Portfolio Investment amortization w ill be reclassified from operating cashflow s to investing cashflow s as this is technically and based on industry practice, a more helpful presentation. This change is expected to be implemented in the audited consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for the year ended December 31, 2022.

151_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,7,FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,7.7,Key operating metrics,7.7.1,,"In this Offering Memorandum, w e present various key operating metrics. We believe that these metrics are helpful in understanding our performance from period to period and facilitate comparison w ith our peers. These metrics are not measures of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flow s or any other measure of performance derived in accordance w ith IFRS. The key operating metrics included in this Offering Memorandum are defined as follow s: - **Average collection of forecasts** : average collection of forecasts means the gross collections on portfolio investments divided by the latest active forecast, on a rolling tw elve month basis. - **Effective Interest Rate (""EIR""):** under IFRS, EIR is the effective interest rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, w hen appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. This means that the EIR is set based on the ERC (as defined below ) at the date of purchase and the portfolio's purchase price. - **Estimated Remaining Collections (""ERC""):** ERC is the nominal value of estimated remaining collections on portfolio investments plus estimated remaining collections from contributions from each of the portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables purchased through co-investor agreements in proportion to our relative ow nership interest in each such portfolio. ERC is calculated as of a point in time, assuming no additional purchases are made thereafter. These expectations are based on historical and current portfolio collection performance data and trends and assumptions about future debt collection rates. There can be no assurances that such collections w ill be achieved w ithin the specified time periods, or at all. There can be no assurances that any cash collected from portfolios subject to co-investment agreements w ill be available to be contributed to the Group, w hether as a result of senior debt service obligations relating to such portfolio, to the extent such senior debt is not held by the Group, or as a result of other restrictions on distributions of cash w ithin the relevant coinvestment agreement. ERC is a measure that is also often used by other companies in the credit management industry. How ever, it may be calculated differently by other companies. ERC is presented because it represents an estimate of the anticipated future cash collections on our portfolio investments at any point in time, w hich is an important supplemental measure used by our management to assess our performance and underscores the cash generation capacity of the assets backing our business. We use ERC as the business case forecast horizon w hen purchasing portfolios. We also use it for accounting purposes and because it is used under the instruments or agreements governing our indebtedness to monitor our performance w hen the lenders are providing funding of portfolio purchases. In this Offering Memorandum w e present ERC over a 180 month period. How ever, for the purpose of the covenants under the Indenture, the Existing Notes Indentures, the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, ERC w ill be measured over an 84 month period. See ""Description of the Notes"" and ""Description of Other Indebtedness."" ###### xiv ----- - **Portfolio investments:** portfolio investments consist of portfolios of delinquent consumer debts, loans, overdue trade receivables (""OTR"") and other receivables purchased at prices below the nominal receivable. As used in this Offering Memorandum, ""portfolio investments"" and ""loans and other overdue receivables"" may be used interchangeably, as the context requires. - **Portfolio investments book value** : portfolio investments book value is the amount recognized in the balance sheet from portfolio investments. The book value of each portfolio corresponds to the present value of estimated future cash flow s discounted by the applicable EIR. Portfolio investments book value represents the aggregate book value of portfolios of purchased loans and receivables as of the dates presented. With respect to co-investment portfolios that w e do not exercise control over, only the proportionate share of the portfolio corresponding to our investment is recorded on the balance sheet. - **Segment earnings:** segment earnings is calculated on a segment basis and is the total operating revenue of the segment excluding common costs for sales, marketing and administration. - **Total collectible value on portfolio investment:** total collectible value on portfolio investments is calculated as the total principal plus interest and fees added to the receivable on portfolio investments. - **Total collectible value on third-party debt:** total collectible value on third-party debt is the total principal plus interest and fees added to the receivable on third-party debt.",N/A,as_expected,2022,428

We provide clients w ith a complete value proposition across the entire CMS value chain, built on our longstanding commitment to fair and ethical collection. We leverage our economies of scale, digitization and large information databases as a part of a larger transformation strategy, ONE Intrum, to increase efficiency, effectively recycle our cash flow s and focus on emerging commercial opportunities. Since January 1, 2020, w e have operated our business, and presented our financial information, on the basis of three segments: (i) the Credit Management Services segment, (ii) the Strategic Markets segment and (iii) the Portfolio Investments segment. As described below, our three segments allow us to offer a full range of services covering a client's entire CMS value chain, w ith each segment also w orking complementarily to drive business and improve data and expertise in other segments. Prior to January 1, 2020, w e operated our business w ith tw o service lines, Credit Management Services and Portfolio Investments, and w ith a focus on four geographic regions.

See ""Summary _Historical _Consolidated Financial and Other Data.""_ - **_Credit M anagement Services segment. Through our Credit Management Services segment, we employ tailored debt collection strategies and solutions to maximize cash flow streams from loans and other overdue receivables for clients w ho have decided to outsource their debt collection function, other than in the countries included in our Strategic Markets segment. In addition to, and generally in combination w ith, collection services, w e provide capabilities in alternative solutions and offer clients a w ide range of value-added services prior to loans and receivables becoming overdue. Our valueadded service offering includes credit information and analysis on individuals and companies to help our clients assess their potential customers' payment capacity, data extraction and modelling, selection and scoring of potential customers, our RES offering and a full suite of services relating to accounts receivable, including invoicing, reminders and account ledger services.

As of January 1, 2020, w e simplified our organizational structure, transitioning aw ay from tw o service lines that focused on four geographic regions and establishing Strategic Markets as our third segment alongside our Credit Management Services segment and Portfolio Investments segment. The establishment of the Strategic Markets segment reflects our strategic grow th in recent years. Our Strategic Markets segment focuses on providing CMS in our Brazilian, Greek, Italian and Spanish operations, w ith the Greek, Italian and Spanish markets in particular being large and important markets in w hich w e have similar operations based on partnerships w ith major financial institutions, including our Piraeus Partnership in Greece and our Intesa Partnership in Italy.

Upon purchase of defaulted receivables, w e put in place long-term debt collection measures aimed at helping customers become debt-free w ith Intrum as w e w ork together to reduce their debt. In line w ith our core values, w hich are based on an empathetic and ethical approach to helping indebted customers become debt free in a respectful manner, w e interact w ith every customer to craft solutions on the basis of their individual circumstances, for example through instalment plans that take account of each consumer's payment capacity. Our Portfolio Investments segment also houses our REO offering. Either (i) in the course of its recovery activities for secured loans (or infrequently in relation to unsecured loans w ith personal guarantees), or (ii) as an outright investment strategy, w e directly or indirectly, and sometimes alongside our co-investors, hold title to real estate (REO) that are expected to be eventually resold. We arrange for the sale of the REOs using internal and external resources and netw orks. Our REO ow nership/exposure is concentrated in Spain and Hungary and together w ith our co-investors, it has a current book value of SEK 296 million (excluding contribution by our joint ventures). For the tw elve months ended September 30, 2022, w e generated revenue of SEK 8,445 million (€825 million equivalent) from our Portfolio Investments segment.

We believe that the combination of our debt collection services, portfolio investments expertise and strategic financial institution partnerships has been and w ill continue to be key to our success. Our complete range of services helps attract and retain clients and increases the breadth and depth of collectible data, in turn supporting the creation of tailored collection strategies and development of analytical capabilities to more accurately price portfolios. Operating across Europe w ith an integrated and balanced business model also gives us investment optionality as w e can allocate resources across our platform and jurisdictions to pursue the opportunities that we find most attractive.

151_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.1,M egatrends and macro drivers strengthening business case,"_Long term trends fuel demand for our services_ We benefit from long term megatrends and macro drivers that f uel demand for our services. European loan stocks have grow n in the period from 2018 through 2021 w ith a CAGR of 5% during that period. During the same period, the average ongoing provisioning by banks w as 55 basis points. During this period, new NPLs w ere created by European banks on an ongoing basis and European NPL stocks are expected to grow, w ith additional supply likely to be generated by the current macroeconomic environment. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, w e expect incremental supply, w ith the Stage 2 loan ratio and costs of borrow ing for households already increasing. _Market shifts increase further potential opportunities_ Changes in the market landscape are increasing further potential opportunities for us. A continuously evolving regulatory framew ork, including increased pressure from regulations such as Basel IV, in a cost focused environment is leading to portfolio sales and increased external servicing needs as banks deleverage and banks accelerate the timeframe for provisioning of NPLs as NPLs become more expensive to hold. In addition, changing consumer behavior, including a rise in shopping online using credit, boosted in part by BNPL companies, could generate additional debt servicing opportunities. A large share of NPLs are held by non-bank financial investors w ho are looking for value-add services and w e have a competitive advantage in partnering w ith leading financial investors for servicing and co-investments. ###### 2 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,428

We are significantly larger than the second largest such credit management company in Europe. For the tw elve months ended September 30, 2022, our Cash EBITDA w as SEK 13,179 million (€1,288 million equivalent). We believe our size gives us several benefits. In particular, our broad and in-depth experience favorably impacts our ability to develop optimal collection strategies and competitively price portfolios in our portfolio investment activities, w hich w e believe has a positive impact on our revenue and efficiency. Additionally, our size allow s us to better absorb fixed costs, compared to smaller companies, including those related to regulatory and legal compliance and IT, w hich further benefits our margins. We also believe that our scale, leading positions, full scope of services across the entire CMS value chain and our broad geographic footprint allow us to provide an increasingly attractive value proposition for our largest clients, w ho provide us w ith increasing sources of opportunities across Europe and enable us to efficiently allocate capital to opportunities w ith the best risk/rew ard profiles. So far in 2022, w e helped approximately 2.5 million customers to become debt free w ith Intrum. _Market leading position in several European countries_ We are present in 24 European countries, w hich is more than any of our European competitors. Based on our internal estimates, w e believe w e are one of the leading players by revenue in most of our geographies. We believe our broad geographic footprint combined w ith strong local market positions is a competitive advantage w hich continues to enhance our ability to serve our existing clients w ith a complete value proposition across diverse markets and the entire CMS value chain and also to expand client relationships. _Leading position in the European financial institutions segment_ Based on our internal estimates, w e believe that w e hold one of the leading positions among credit management providers w ith respect to financial institutions clients in Europe. We believe that the financial institutions segment in Europe continues to represent one of the most attractive segments of the credit management market. Financial institutions are the largest originator of debt and, based on data from the EBA, European Union/ European Economic Area bank NPL stock amounted to approximately SEK 4 trillion (€0.4 trillion equivalent) (excluding subsidiaries from EU aggregate, including in individual country disclosure) as of December 31, 2021. The financial institutions segment also offers attractive economics w ith long durations and high earnings visibility. We have a long track record of collecting on NPLs and have built long-term relationships w ith European financial institutions. During the three years ended December 31, 2021, w e acquired NPLs w ith a total collectible value on portfolio investments (including NPLs held through joint ventures) of SEK 356 billion (€33 billion equivalent) from European financial institutions. For the year ended December 31, 2021, 81% of cash revenue in our Portfolio Investments segment w as generated by portfolios acquired from financial institutions. In addition, we have a strong track record in entering into strategic partnerships w ith financial institutions, including long-term servicing contracts and often the carve-out of operational servicing platforms. _Leading position in the European trade segment for credit management services and portfolio investments_ Based on our internal estimates, w e believe that w e hold a leading position among credit management providers in providing servicing and acquisition of OTR to nonfinancial services companies in Europe. The OTR segment complements the financial institutions segment as it offers a relatively stable and high volume of stock w ith short duration. In many of the markets in w hich w e operate, w e believe OTR flow s benefit from a structural shift and changing consumer behavior tow ards a higher proportion of pay-later payment options, including invoice payments, installment payment plans and checkout payment plans, such as buy-now -pay-later (""BNPL"") plans, and increased outsourcing of CMS operations. Furthermore, during the course of 2022 and in the context of rising inflation, w e have seen increasing new inflow s of utility receivables in our Credit Management Services segment.",N/A,as_expected,2022,428

In recent years, w e have also increased our activities in the secured consumer debt market segment, including through acquisitions such as: - the June 2016 acquisition of 85% of Aktua, one of the leading credit management companies in the secured NPL segment in Spain, w ith Santander holding the remaining 15%, w hich strengthened our RES capabilities in the Spanish market; - the purchase of a real estate portfolio from Ibercaja in December 2018, w hich w e hold w ith a coinvestor, w hich bolstered our REO capabilities in the Spanish market; - our acquisition in April 2019, of 80% of Solvia, w hich offers real estate management services in the Spanish market and w hich further built out our RES capabilities and our acquisition of the remaining 20% of Solvia in December 2022; - our partnership w ith Piraeus Bank in Greece, w hich began in October 2019, and w hich has w orked both as a platform for acquisitions in Greece but has also strengthened our secured offering and increased exposure to secured claims and REOs in Greece; - the co-investment in Italy of a portfolio of secured UTPs w ith a gross book value of approximately €250 million in April 2021, an asset type w hich is expected to grow strongly in Italy over the coming years; and - the co-investment in Italy of a secured leasing portfolio w ith a gross book value of €1.1 billion in November 2021, w hich further expanded our secured offerings in the Italian market.

We expect continued regular and pro-active sales by banks as they manage a broad range of new rules and regulations such as, for example, Basel IV, IFRS 9 and ECB calendar provisioning. As a result, w e anticipate an increase in debt sales as a proportion of NPL stock. Ultimately, the evolution of NPL stock depends on the macroeconomic situations of the countries in question. For example, in a favorable macroeconomic environment, NPL generation is more muted, as evidenced by declining NPL levels over the last few years. Follow ing a dow nturn, such as is currently being experienced on a global level in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chain disruptions and shortages of commodities, inflationary pressures, the effects of the Russian invasion of Ukraine (including sanctions and counter sanctions) and other factors, we would generally expect an increase in the generation of new NPLs.

Key features of our grow th strategy include: ###### 7 ----- - _Full client offering providing integrated CMS and financial services solutions. We offer our clients both CMS and financial services solutions, providing them w ith the full scope of services across the CMS value chain. We believe that our complete value proposition, geographic footprint and scale are highly attractive to existing and potential clients. For example, our Intesa Partnership included entering into a long-term servicing contract and, through a joint venture, the acquisition of an NPL portfolio. Our Piraeus Partnership also included a long-term servicing contract and the acquisition of a leading independent service platform, and subsequently through a joint venture, the acquisition of NPL portfolios. See ""Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations— _Significant factors affecting results of operations—Acquisitions, geographic expansion and divestments.""_ These transactions demonstrate the breadth of our capabilities and the attractiveness of our value proposition to our clients. Furthermore, w e see opportunities to increase our share of w allet w ith existing CMS clients by providing services to them throughout their geographic footprint and service needs. Additionally, our Credit Management Services and Strategic Markets segments provide us w ith deep insight into the portfolios of our clients and enable us to competitively price portfolios. - _Continued focus on acquisitions of unsecured NPL and expansion of consumer (_ ""B2C"") debt, secured _debt and real estate services. Unsecured consumer NPL sales volumes have remained high as banks_ increasingly prefer to sell their debt to trusted debt collection agencies in order to clean up their balance sheets and focus on their core business. We expect a continued high level of NPL sales, given factors such as the grow th in consumer lending and ECB regulation of NPLs. We expect to continue to deploy capital w ithin the unsecured NPL space in order to gain scale in markets w here we are not a leader and, to a lesser extent, to opportunistically enter new business areas. We expect to continue to partner w ith banks on bilaterally agreed large, complex and sensitive transactions, of w hich our Intesa Partnership and Piraeus Partnership are tw o recent examples. Additionally, secured NPL transactions have increased in recent years and represent a large portion of the NPL market. In April 2021, w e completed the acquisition of an Italian portfolio of UTPs w ith a gross book value of approximately €250 million in a co-investment w hich w as Intrum's first investment in UTPs, an asset type w hich is expected to grow strongly in Italy over the coming years.

In our Portfolio Investments segment, w e see a pipeline in terms of the number and the size of investment opportunities available, w hich may outpace our on-balance sheet investment appetite. We consider flexible capital deployment initiatives, such as co-investment structures including capital partnerships, w hich provide us w ith the ability to acquire larger, mixed portfolios by sharing risk w ith co-investment partners. Co-investments also increase the breadth of our origination platform by leveraging the netw ork of our co-investment partners.

We have a strong track record of expansion into new business areas and expanding our presence w ithin existing markets. We have established operations in 25 countries, including through partnerships and strategic transactions such as carve-outs and bolt-on acquisitions. Our Intesa Partnership established us as a leading player in late payments in Italy, one of Europe's most attractive markets, and w ith our Piraeus Partnership w e have created the first independent leading credit management platform in Greece. Based on EBA data, our geographic footprint covers 98% of European NPLs, as of December 31, 2021.

Going forw ard, w e w ill continue to proactively evaluate opportunities to gain market share in existing markets w here we currently do not hold leading positions and, to a lesser extent, opportunistically enter new business areas, for example through carve-outs and targeted acquisitions. When entering new business areas, our strategy is typically based on a cautious first entry: w e start small and increase our investments as our insight and experience in a particular market increases. Moreover, w e often strengthen our local know ledge and databases through business acquisitions and/or carve-out transactions (as w e have previously done in the United Kingdom, Spain, Poland, Italy and Greece).

While adverse economic conditions in the markets in w hich w e operate may lead to higher default rates on claims, w hich in turn may increase the stock of portfolios available for us to purchase and the amount of loans and other overdue receivables possessed by our debt collection clients, there can be no assurances of the timing of any increases in the amount of debt available to us for purchase and to service or that such increases w ill compensate for the adverse effects that a general economic dow nturn, including in connection w ith the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the associated economic, social and geopolitical repercussions, as w ell as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, high inflation and, in particular, high and increasing energy prices and interest rates, w ith prolonged recessions and higher unemployment expected to persist in many of these markets in the near term, may otherw ise have on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The Russian military invasion in Ukraine beginning in February 2022 has already had a negative effect on both European and global economies and led to large degree of uncertainty. The further development of this armed conflict, related sanctions and counter-sanctions, as w ell as their long-term repercussions on the global economy and markets are still unclear. Since Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia are direct neighbors of Ukraine, the crisis could in particular affect the local markets in w hich w e operate due to, amongst other factors, the significant influx of refugees into those countries. Risks have also increased for the Baltic countries (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) due to their direct border w ith Russia and the fact that historically they w ere part of the Soviet Union . Further sanctions against Russia could also have material adverse effects on the broader European economic environment in w hich w e operate. See also ""—The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our business and _exacerbate other risks discussed within this section.""_ Since the beginning of 2022, the economic conditions in the markets in w hich w e operate have gradually deteriorated. While the impact on our performance has so far been limited, should the economic conditions in the markets in w hich w e operate persist or deteriorate further, w e may not be able to perform debt collection at levels consistent w ith our historic levels due to the inability of customers to make payments at the same levels or at all, as w as the case during the 2008-2010 economic dow nturn. Adverse economic conditions may also reduce the propensity of debt originators to sell overdue receivables as sale prices may be unfavorable during such periods. For example, this dynamic w as demonstrated in particular during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and remained relevant throughout the majority of 2020 until prices became more normalized. Furthermore, a material and adverse economic dow nturn could result in protracted, increased unemployment rates or could further impact interest rates (w hich have already risen unilaterally in recent months) and restrict the availability of credit, resulting in decreased demand for our payment services. European countries are currently experiencing decades-high levels of inflation, w hich could impact the carrying value of unsecured portfolio investments, reduce our capacity to take on new debt, increase our costs in making payments on existing debt and as w ell as create economic hardship for customers especially if it effects employment rates. Increased energy costs in recent months could also create economic hardship for customers, making it more difficult for customers to make payments at the same level, or at all. 24 ----- There can be no assurances that economic conditions w ill improve in the markets in w hich w e operate or that the net effect of any change in economic conditions w ill be positive.

Any decrease in our ability to purchase debt portfolios or provide credit management services could materially and adversely affect our business.,"The demand for our credit optimization, payment and collection services and the availability of debt portfolios at prices that allow us to generate profits depend on a number of factors, some of w hich are outside of our control, including: - consumer spending levels, w hich have been impacted in the markets in w hich w e operate by current inflation levels, the macroeconomic effects of the Russian invasion of Ukraine (including higher gas and oil prices), and the COVID-19 pandemic (see ""—The geopolitical and economic conditions in the markets in which we operate affect our business_ ."" and ""—The COVID-19 pandemic, or similar _outbreaks, may adversely affect our business and exacerbate other risks discussed within this ""Risk Factors"" section"");_ - the availability of credit to consumers and consumers' borrow ing appetite, w hich is driven by a number of factors including general economic conditions, interest rates, heightened regulation of the credit card and consumer lending industry, changing credit origination strategies, tighter lending criteria introduced by consumer credit providers and changing individual and cultural attitudes tow ard funding spending w ith borrow ing; - the level of non-performance on consumer debt portfolios and the proportion of such portfolios that are w ritten off by originators, w hich may in turn affect the availability of credit to consumers identified above; 25 ----- - sales of debt portfolios by originators, w hich could be adversely impacted by a change in accounting policies or practices, the consolidation of credit card issuers or increased sophistication in internal collection efforts; - potential concerns that the value received for defaulted debt portfolios as a percentage of their total collectible value may not outw eigh the potential reputational risks or required management attention associated w ith selling defaulted debt portfolios; - negative publicity or a loss of trust in our industry due to our failure, or the failure of one or more of our competitors, to meet legal, regulatory or other obligations, or consumer Environmental, Social and Governance (""ESG"") expectations; - increased government regulation of the circumstances in w hich originators, in particular regulated entities, have a right to collect on debt; and - the macroeconomic environments of the countries in w hich w e operate. Originators may develop technological tools that could override the advantages w e believe w e currently possess in terms of tracing technology and customer profile development.

Adverse economic conditions and uncertainties, including any fines or penalties on European financial institutions and any potential resulting failures or consolidations of financial institutions, may adversely affect us by significantly reducing our client engagements and even small instances of reduced engagements could adversely impact our revenues, given the concentration from individual customers in the Strategic Markets segment.

The global spread of COVID-19 caused business disruption, and exceptionally high degrees of volatility in international debt and equity markets. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to cause disruption to the global economy as w ell as the markets in w hich w e operate. This includes both the direct effects of the pandemic, including sickness and hospitalizations, as w ell as indirect effects due, for instance, to local government initiatives to curb the spread the COVID-19, including, for example, the partial closure or disruption of court and legal systems, the reduction in consumer spending associated w ith limitations on freedom of movement; temporary closures of non-essential businesses and supply chain disruptions, but also the introduction of various kinds of support measures including 26 ----- debt servicing supplements and moratoria on punitive measures w ithin certain financial relationships. If these or similar measures are reintroduced in the future in response to additional w aves of COVID-19 or otherw ise, it may have a negative impact on our revenues and profitability. Further, even as lockdow n measures have eased across Europe and courts and legal processes have become operational, the backlog of cases has meant a gradual return to normal operations and residual ""catchup"" activities, w hich in some countries are still ongoing. This has had an impact on our business w hen and to the extent access to the courts w as necessary to service debt in a timely and effectively manner. The introduction of any further lockdow n measures could therefore result in further delay to legal and court processes w hich could in turn have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

The situation could deteriorate again and the extent to w hich the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our results w ill depend on future developments, w hich are uncertain and difficult to accurately predict, including additional w aves of infections in the regions in w hich w e operate, new information w hich may emerge concerning the severity of new COVID-19 variants and the actions taken or being continued to contain it or address the pandemic's impact. For example, in connection w ith COVID-19 or any governmental responses to COVID-19, w e may experience, among other risks, increased currency and interest rate volatility, reduced access to external capital, increased cyber security threats as a result of phishing campaigns and targeted attacks and increased cyber security vulnerability and increased risk of data breaches due to the lasting shift to more remote w orking environments. The COVID-19 pandemic could have further adverse effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition if (i) adverse capital and credit market conditions increase our cost of capital or affect our ability to raise capital, and our cash generation is not sufficient for our needs, or (ii) tax rates are increased to fund the cost of various government initiatives initiated in connection w ith the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the conditions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and the global impact it has had, w e reduced the forecast for collections on our unsecured portfolios (unsecured portfolios accounting for 93% of all portfolio investments excluding joint ventures (""JVs"") and REOs for the last tw elve month period ending in September 30, 2022) in March 2020 for the follow ing 3 to 12 months, although at a global level, after experiencing an initial shock to collections, w e outperformed these forecasts and performed in line w ith the forecast prior to the adjustment.

The EC believes one of the key areas for reducing risk in the European banking sector is to further decrease the number of NPLs on banks' balance sheets. In order to address a rise of NPLs in the banking sector, the EC proposed a series of actions w ith four main goals: (i) further developing secondary markets for distressed assets to decrease the number of NPLs on banks ' balance sheets, (ii) reforms to the EU's corporate insolvency and debt recovery legislation in order to converge the insolvency framew orks across the EU, (iii) support the establishment and cooperation of national asset management companies and (iv) taking precautionary measures to ensure continued funding. Continued efforts by the EU to reduce the number of NPLs on the balance sheets of banks could lead to a reduction in the number of debt portfolios available for purchase and could increase competition for those portfolios w hich are available. On December 15, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic and due to the expected increase in the volume of NPLs across the EU, the EC published a further initiative related to tackling NPLs and follow ing on the publication of the action plan the European Union and the Council on April 17, 2019 adopted Regulation (EU) 2019/630 as regards minimum loss coverage for non-performing exposures regulating, inter alia, the definition of non-performing exposures (such as NPLs) and the treatment of same by credit institutions, including for example to put aside sufficient resources w hen new loans become non-performing. Furthermore, and related thereto, the European Parliament and the Council on November 24, 2021 adopted Directive (EU) 2021/2167 on credit servicers and credit purchasers (the ""NPL Directive""). In short, the NPL Directive applies to non-performing credit agreements that are more than 90 days due or w here the lending credit institution considers it unlikely to be repaid by the borrow er and is intended to create a new EU-w ide framew ork that is intended to facilitate the transfer by credit institutions of NPLs to credit purchasers and the development of a secondary market for NPLs for credit purchasers and servicers. Legal persons that perform ""credit servicing activities"" as defined in the NPL Directive w ill be required to obtain authorisation as a credit servicer w ith their respective national competent authorities. Furthermore, the NPL Directive sets out requirements for dealings w ith borrow ers including communication requirements, and disclosures as w ell as information requirements tow ards competent authorities. Member states are required to implement the NPL Directive so that its provisions apply as of December 30, 2023. The NPL Directive w ill apply directly to our operations as currently conducted and w ill impose additional compliance and operational requirements that may 28 ----- increase our costs and affect our financial position. It should be noted that legislative measures at the national level transposing the NPL Directive are generally not available at the date hereof and it remains to be seen how the NPL Directive w ill be implemented. While incumbent players may benefit from the framew ork established by the NPL Directive, for example, if the NPL Directive leads to more purchases of NPLs from credit institutions being facilitated, it may be that competition by new players w ill increase as a result of the NPL Directive, w hich could have an adverse impact on our business. There can be no assurance that the impact of these regulations or others like them enacted or imposed in other jurisdictions w ill not impede our ability to conduct our operations, result in further litigation or have a negative impact on our business. _Data protection_ We are subject to various regulatory requirements regarding data protection in the jurisdictions in w hich w e operate. Such regulatory requirements differ from country to country. In the past, regulatory authorities have imposed fines on certain of our subsidiaries for non-compliance w ith data protection regulations and w e cannot assure you that similar fines w ill not be imposed in the future. The imposition of any such fines or any other sanctions by regulatory authorities may have negative consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In particular, if it turns out that any business activity we conduct is non-compliant, w e may be ordered to cease such business activity until the breach is cured. Changes to data protection law s and regulations or changes to their interpretation by data protection authorities and courts may reduce our operational flexibility and limit our ability to collect, retain or use our customer data to price portfolios and create efficient debt collection strategies. We are subject to the regulation on the protection of natural persons w ith regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation, the ""GDPR"") adopted by the European Parliament and the European Council. The GDPR became directly applicable in all EU Member States on May 25, 2018, and replaced Directive 95/46/EC and existing national data protection legislation, w as also implemented in EEA countries w ith effect from the same date and is now implemented in the United Kingdom by the European Union (Withdraw al) Act 2018 (the ""UK GDPR""). The GDPR and UK GDPR significantly changed the EU/EEA and United Kingdom data protection landscapes, respectively, including strengthening of individuals' rights, stricter requirements on companies processing personal data and stricter sanctions w ith substantial administrative fines. Violating the GDPR could result in penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of global revenue, w hichever is higher. The GDPR and UK GDPR also offer data subjects the option to let a privacy organization litigate on their behalf, including collecting the potential damages. The GDPR and UK GDPR regime imposes a substantially higher compliance burden on the credit management industry, including on our operations. While w e have put in place rules, policies and procedures aimed at achieving compliance w ith the GDPR and UK GDPR, there can be no assurance that such rules, policies and procedures w ill be successful in ensuring compliance w ith GDPR and UK GDPR. Any failure to comply w ith the GDPR and UK GDPR could result in sanctions, penalties or other negative consequences w hich could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we could lose a competitive advantage and our business could be negatively affected if current governmental regulations w ere to change such that certain of the information or customer data that w e use becomes public, the countries w here w e operate introduce measures that have the effect of facilitating the tracing of customers or allow ing credit market participants direct access to credit information before the purchase of portfolios or to prohibit us from using customer data in the manner or to the extent currently used. _Statutes of limitation_ In most of the countries in w hich w e currently have local operations, w e are able to extend the statutes of limitation on historic debt claims by taking legal action, notifying the customer or otherw ise interrupting the limitation period. Some of the countries in w hich w e operate have in recent years changed the statutes of limitation for certain debt including by limiting the ability to extend or interrupt the limitation period, or have discussed such changes. There can be no assurances that w e w ould be successful in adjusting our operations to these or other similar regulatory changes. _Consumer protection_ The credit management industry could be subject to increased scrutiny due to local political factors and developments, w hich could in turn lead to changes in law s and regulations. The area of consumer credit has recently come under increased regulatory focus by national governments. For instance, caps on interest rate and penalties or sanctions for defaulted loans or total cost of credit have been introduced in several of the countries in w hich w e operate. Such legislation may also be introduced in other jurisdictions and such restrictions can materially affect the consumer credit market as lenders derive a large portion of their profits from credit costs. Stricter regulations regarding installment plans have also been or in the future may be enacted or imposed by court ruling in countries in w hich w e operate. For example, a March 2019 ruling by the Court of Justice of the EU held, in a case originating from Spain, that certain accelerated repayment clauses of mortgages found to be unfair cannot be maintained in part, w ith those elements w hich make it unfair are removed, w here removing those 29 ----- elements w ould amount to altering the substance of the clause. Further, the ruling empow ers national courts of EU Member States or the United Kingdom to replace those terms found unfair w ith legislative provisions w here their inclusion is necessary for the continued existence of the loan contract and annulment of such contract w ould expose the consumer to unfavorable consequences. As a result of this ruling, increased uncertainty exists on our ability to enforce collection terms on business to consumer secured loans. In November 2020, the EU adopted a directive on representative actions (Directive 2020/1828) to facilitate class actions both for injunctions and compensations, replacing the so-called ""injunctions directive"" (Directive 2009/22/EC), w hich could also entail higher levels of litigation and in turn jeopardize our collection ability. There can be no assurance that the impact of these regulations or others like them enacted or imposed in other jurisdictions w ill not impede our ability to conduct our operations, result in further litigation or have a negative impact on our business. _Debt collection_ Licensing requirements for debt collection services differ from market to market. Many markets have a licensing requirement and supervision of compliance. In December 2016, the European Court of Justice (Third Chamber) ruled that a debt collection agency w hich concludes a rescheduling agreement for an unpaid credit on behalf of a lender but w hich acts as a credit intermediary only in an ancillary capacity must be regarded as being a credit intermediary and is not subject to the obligation to provide the consumer w ith pre-contractual information. Follow ing the ruling, some countries in the EU have required debt collection companies that offer installment plans to hold a consumer credit license so as to be bound by the relevant EU directive. Such license requirements have already been imposed in some countries in w hich w e operate, including Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Although large incumbent credit management providers tend to be better placed to comply w ith a high regulatory burden, stricter regulations in general may increase our compliance burden and operating costs. Any temporary or permanent revocation of our debt collection licenses by the licensing authorities in the jurisdictions in w hich we operate may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Many of the countries in w hich w e operate have also implemented regulations providing limitations on costs for debt collection and duties of disclosure to consumer customers. As noted under the section ""Non-performing loan _directive"" above, the NPL Directive is set to enter into force in the EU at the latest during 2023 and w ill impose_ certain rules relating to debt collection activities w here pertaining to NPLs, including, for example, information disclosure requirements tow ards borrow ers. Customers may become subject to insolvency or debt reorganization proceedings w hich may delay or prevent the enforcement of the claims transferred to us. Collection of unsecured debt claims in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency is generally limited by means of the funds available for distribution from the insolvent estate.

Our ability to realize operational efficiency improvements depends on a variety of factors, including, among others, legal, regulatory and contractual restrictions. External factors beyond our control, such as systemic failures in our industry or the industry sectors of our clients and changes in fiscal and monetary policies, may impact our ability to realize such operational efficiency improvements. Estimates regarding the impact of our operational efficiency improvements are subject to a number of assumptions about the timing, execution and costs associated w ith realizing such operational efficiency improvements.

Our reputation is important to maintaining our relationships w ith current and potential clients, in particular financial institutions, and w ith regulators. The follow ing events, among others, could have a negative effect on our reputation and financial results: (i) negative media publicity relating either to us or the w ider credit management industry; (ii) allegations of unethical or improper behavior by us or any of the third parties w e use in the collection process; (iii) inability to collect debts on an accurate and timely basis; (iv) failure to respect and treat customers fairly; (v) failures in our collection and data protection processes; (vi) the actions of third parties that w e engage in the debt collection process; (vii) failure in our IT platform, in particular IT security; or (viii) other operational issues, litigation, regulatory restrictions, investigations, fines or enforcement actions.

Under most of our debt collection contracts we are not paid until the customer begins paying on the claim and w e may be unable to accurately predict the costs or identify the risks or complexity of services associated w ith these contracts, w hich may result in low er than expected margins, losses under the contracts or even the loss of clients. Our contracts for debt collection services also subject us to penalty clauses, benchmark clauses, extraordinary termination clauses and change of control provisions. If w e are unable to satisfy the terms of our contracts, the contracts may be terminated and w e may lose clients and revenue. A number of our long-term debt service agreements are subject to early termination rights on the part of the customer that, if exercised, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our contracts for debt collection may be terminated by the client for reasons unrelated to our performance (for example in the event of a change of control in its ow nership or sale of the underlying portfolio, as occurred in Spain and Italy in 2018 and 2019). In such circumstances w e may be entitled to compensation, but there can be no assurance that such compensation w ill fully reflect all losses suffered. Many of our debt collection contracts have a stated term, typically one to tw o years, and, in some cases, termination clauses permitting the client to cancel the contract at the client's discretion follow ing the expiration of an agreed notice period. There can be no assurances that our clients w ill not exercise their rights to terminate their contracts prior to expiration or that w e w ill be successful in negotiating new contracts w ith clients w hen such contracts expire. In addition, w e are also exposed to unforeseen changes in the scope of existing contracts, including changes in prices or volumes due to changes in the general business or political landscape of our clients. Most of our debt collection contracts do not have volume commitments and a client can eliminate or reduce the volume of claims they outsource to us for debt collection w ithout formally terminating the contract. For example, in 2020 and 2021, in part due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of clients decreased the volume of claims that they outsourced to us. We may have disputes or disagreements w ith our clients as to contract terms or the level of services we have agreed to provide.

If the assumptions w e use in our models are incorrect, the relevant portfolio could lose value and could result in subsequent negative revaluations in our statement of financial position and a continuing deterioration in value over time as actual collections may deviate significantly from the collection estimates produced by our pricing model at the time of purchase. Such assumptions include but are not limited to an assumption that claims are not time barred, that the age and balances of purchased claims are correctly stated by the sellers, that customers are alive, that claims are not a result of fraud, money laundering or financing of terrorist activities and that accounts in a portfolio w ill generally behave in line w ith our models. While w e have had a net book value increase in respect of our Portfolio Investment segment during the third quarter of 2022, w e wrote dow n certain of our portfolio investment including investments via joint venture arrangements during the period due to low ered collection expectations on specific portfolios invested via joint venture arrangements .

In the fourth quarter of 2022, w e w ill further reduce the book value of the Intesa JV recognized in our financial statements by approximately SEK 3.1 billion and recognize an impairment loss on related customer relationships of approximately SEK 0.2 billion. This is to reflect the updated valuation of our 62.5% exposure in Intesa JV implied by the CarVal-Kistefos Transaction in November 2022. We w ill also low er ERC associated w ith the Intesa JV by approximately SEK 5.4 billion. See “Summary–Recent Developments–CarVal-Kistefos Transaction” for more information. For the year ended December 31, 2021, w e w rote up our portfolio investment by net SEK 133 million, w hich constituted 0.4% of our portfolio investment carrying value as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021. In the year ended December 31, 2020, w e w rote dow n our portfolio investment by net SEK 33 million, w hich is 0.1% of our portfolio investment carrying value as of December 31, 2020. We seek to purchase loans at a significant discount to total collectible value on portfolio investments. These are typically loans that customers have failed to repay and, in many cases, that the client has deemed 33 ----- uncollectable. It is crucial for our business that w e are able to identify portfolios that are of sufficient quality for us to determine that w e are likely to collect on the claims. Clients generally make numerous attempts to recover on their overdue loans and other overdue receivables before selling them, often using a combination of in-house recovery efforts and third-party collection agencies. These overdue claims are difficult to collect and w e may not collect a sufficient amount on the claims to cover the investment associated w ith purchasing the portfolios and the costs of running our business. There can be no assurances that any of the claims contained in our purchased portfolios w ill eventually be collected. Many of our claims are unsecured and an increase in bankruptcy filings involving customers could impact our ability to collect on those claims. Additionally, changes to bankruptcy, insolvency or other legislation in the markets in w hich w e operate as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherw ise, including in the United Kingdom as a result of the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (""CIGA"") and in the EU as a result of efforts to harmonize insolvency regimes across countries, could impact our ability to collect on claims. Further, contracts entered into w ith our clients for the purchase of debt portfolios may impose various restrictions on our realization of value from the portfolios and may restrict our flexibility in pursuing certain enforcement and collection activities. If the cash flow s from our existing and future portfolios are less than anticipated, w e may not have sufficient funds to purchase new portfolios, may have to pay a higher interest rate to finance the purchase of new portfolios or may have to accept low er returns on new portfolios. Any of the above could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The statistical models and data analysis tools that w e use in our business may prove to be inaccurate, preventing us from achieving anticipated levels of returns, and w e may be unable to appropriately identify and address underperforming portfolios. We use internally developed models and other data analysis tools extensively in our operations. For example, w e use our experience-driven models to estimate collection curves in relation to potential portfolio purchases. How ever, these models and data analysis tools are subject to several limitations and may not be reliable. At the time of purchase, w e are likely to have imperfect information about the precise age of the debt, the ability of the customer to pay, the time at w hich the customer is likely to pay and the cost required to service and collect on such debts. Moreover, our historical information about portfolios may not be indicative of the characteristics of subsequent portfolios purchased from the same client or w ithin the same industry due to changes in business practices or economic developments. Further, the availability of relevant data varies from market to market. In addition, certain assets, such as secured loans, have different risk and collection profiles than the unsecured loans and receivables that have historically been our main focus. There is a significant amount of management judgment and estimation involved in purchasing and valuing portfolios and there can be no assurances that management judgments and estimates w ill prove to be accurate. Furthermore, there can be no assurances that w e w ill be able to appropriately identify and address underperforming portfolios. In addition, our ability to properly price portfolios may be adversely affected if w e have limited experience in purchasing the type of portfolio, operating in the particular region or dealing w ith the specific client involved. Lack of reliable information or incorrect assumptions can lead to mispricing of portfolios w hich may have an adverse effect on the financial return from the portfolios. Our statistical models and analysis tools assess information provided by third parties, such as credit information suppliers and other mainstream or public sources, or generated by softw are products. We have no control over the accuracy or sufficiency of information received from third parties. If such information is not accurate or sufficient, w e could incorrectly price new portfolios or incorrectly value ex isting portfolios, set client prices or performance goals inaccurately or experience low er liquidation rates or larger operating expenses. Similarly, due to the nature of our business, w e are not able to independently verify the quality of all of the debt claims w e purchase, in particular w ith regard to forw ard flow debt purchase agreements, and w e rely on representations made by our debt purchase clients. Any inaccuracy in these representations, including in relation to the validity of the debt claims, may result in a loss of revenue and w e may not be successful in recovering such losses from our customers. There can be no assurances that any of the current or future loans contained in our portfolio investments w ill eventually be collected. If w e are not able to achieve forecasted levels of collection, valuation impairments may be recognized, amortization may increase and revenue and returns on purchases of portfolios may be reduced. This may in turn impact our modeling for future collections, w hich is less reliable if w e are not able to accurately predict the quantity and identity of customers w ho reduce their debt payments or the magnitude of such reductions. Furthermore, some of our contracts contain guaranteed solution rate commitments pursuant to w hich w e guarantee a minimum level of collections to our clients. If w e fail to reach these collection requirements, as has occurred in the past, w e may have to make significant payments to such clients or such clients may reduce the amount of overdue loans and receivables that w e are entitled to collect under these contracts.

The availability of portfolios at prices that generate an appropriate return depends on a number of factors both w ithin and outside of our control, such as the levels of overdue loans and other receivables, volumes of portfolio sales by clients and competitive factors affecting potential purchasers and debt originators. Additionally, an increase in demand for portfolios among competitors, including financial investors, could result in portfolios being sold to competitors. There can be no assurances that w e w ill be able to identify a sufficient volume of portfolios at appropriate prices. If w e are unable to identify portfolios at appropriate prices or of sufficient quality, w e may have to purchase loans of asset types or in industries in w hich w e have little or no experience, or in industries w here it is more difficult to collect on overdue receivables due to secrecy requirements, for example in the healthcare or legal sector.

Such factors may include, among others, w eak economic and capital market conditions during or prior to periods in w hich attractive portfolios are available for purchase, the ability and w illingness of banks to lend to our industry generally or to us in particular and changes in fiscal, monetary and other government policies. There can be no assurances that the terms of our existing or future indebtedness w ill not limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness to fund such portfolio purchases. Additionally, our ability to purchase portfolios of debt using cash generated by our debt collection operations is highly affected by seasonal factors, including the number of w ork days in a given month, the propensity of customers to take holidays at particular times of the year and annual cycles in disposable income. Accordingly, collections w ithin portfolios tend to have high seasonal variances, w hile our costs are more evenly spread out over the year, resulting in high variances of margins and profitability betw een quarters. Furthermore, our debt portfolio purchases are likely to be uneven during the year due to fluctuating supply and demand w ithin the market. The combination of seasonal collections and costs and uneven purchases may result in low cash flow at a time w hen attractive debt portfolios become available. There can be no assurances that in the future w e w ill be able to obtain interim funding from our shareholders, by making other borrow ings or by partnering w ith coinvestors or co-venture partners at the time w hen attractive debt portfolios become available.

We may be required to purchase debt under a forw ard flow agreement for an amount higher than w e w ould otherw ise have agreed at the time of purchase, w hich could result in reduced returns. In a more competitive environment, w e could be faced w ith a decision to either decrease our purchasing volume or agree to forw ard flow agreements at increased prices or w ith less contractual protections, any of w hich could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations. We generally contemplate future fluctuations in the value of the debt that w e purchase through forw ard flow agreements, but such fluctuations in value may exceed our expectations. If the quality of debt purchased varies from our pricing assumptions, w e may also price the contract improperly.

The success of such acquisitions, strategic transactions and carve-out transactions is dependent upon, among others, appropriate due diligence, the negotiation of favorable terms and the eventual successful integration of the acquired businesses. It may take longer than anticipated to realize anticipated benefits from such acquisitions, carve-out transactions and other strategic 36 ----- transactions and there can be no assurances that w e w ill be able to extract anticipated synergies or that such potential benefits w ill outw eigh the associated costs. In addition, w e may experience delays in integration processes. Further, acquisitions, carve-out transactions, and other strategic transactions may place additional constraints on our resources, including diverting the attention of our management from existing business operations to integration processes. We have historically expanded through both external and organic grow th and w e may continue to grow by selectively identifying potential acquisitions of portfolios and businesses as w ell as carve-out opportunities w ith respect to collection units. If w e do acquire other businesses or complete other carve-out transactions, w e may not be able to successfully integrate these businesses and assets w ith our ow n and w e may be unable to maintain our standards, controls and policies w hich may result in compliance issues, goodw ill w rite-offs and damage to our reputation. For example, w hen integrating new businesses and collection units, w e face costs and security risks due to the need to integrate the IT platform of the purchased company or carved-out operations into our existing IT platform. Additionally, if w e purchase a large portfolio w e may be unable to successfully integrate it into our existing operations, the successful integration of the portfolio may take longer than anticipated or the costs associated w ith successfully integrating it may be higher than anticipated. Further, w e are subject to the risks associated w ith w rite-dow ns and impairments of goodw ill in connection w ith acquisitions. Our grow th strategy has historically sometimes included opportunistically entering into new geographies or new business areas through selective acquisitions and carve-outs that w e believe w ill complement and enhance our pan-European value proposition.

Integrating recently ac quired business and achieving the expected operational synergies w ill require the dedication of management resources that may temporarily divert attention from our day-to-day operations and w e may face unforeseen challenges in operating w ithin unfamiliar commercial, cultural and regulatory environments. For example, follow ing the acquisition of the portfolio of receivables from Erste Bank Hungary, amendments to local legislation affected the process through w hich collections on assets may be achieved and w e w ere required to adapt our expectations to account for this change accordingly. Further, in 2019, Spain passed updated mortgage legislation, and Greece has recently passed a set of new s law s, including a new private bankruptcy law, that are in each case relevant to our operations and could require us to spend additional time and expenses to analyze and comply w ith the updated legislation .

In light of the BEPS action plan, launched by the OECD and supported by the EU, and its rapid development, there is now unprecedented support for global tax coordination among jurisdictions w hich could have a significant impact on the international taxation landscape in w hich w e operate. The most significant upcoming change that w ill potentially impact the Group in the near future are the OECD Pillar Tw o or GloBE (Global Anti-Base Erosion) rules, otherw ise know n as the global minimum tax rules. These rules are meant to ensure that multinational entities of a certain size operating in jurisdictions that are subject to an effective corporate tax rate of less than 15%, w ill pay at least this effective corporate tax rate through a series of new tax rules. EU has proposed to implement these rules in 2024. How ever, certain EU Member States have indicated that they intend to implement the rules in 2023. Due to the Group's revenue size, these rules w ill be applicable to Intrum and w ill lead to increased tax and compliance costs for the Group, especially if implementat ion is not universal across the EU. Another relevant outcome of the BEPS project is the implementation of rules, or adjustments to existing rules, relating to interest cost deduction for corporate income taxes across numerous jurisdictions. Such rules normally set a cap for deduction of net interest expenses calculated as a certain percentage of tax EBITDA, often w ith certain exceptions and safe harbor thresholds. The Sw edish rules, as detailed below, are the most relevant for the Group since its ultimate parent and treasury operations are located in Sw eden, but the corresponding rules in any jurisdiction w e operate can be relevant for our overall tax costs.",N/A,as_expected,2022,428

The business, including the implementation of transactions betw een entities w ithin the Group, is conducted in accordance w ith our interpretation and understanding of current tax legislation, tax treaties and other provisions, case law and claims from tax authorities. How ever, there is a risk that our interpretation and application of tax rules, treaties and other regulations and requirements have not been or w ill not continue to be completely accurate in all respects. There is also a risk that the tax authorities in the countries concerned w ill issue decisions that deviate from our interpretation. Changes in tax law or practice could result in financial losses or increased expenses for the Company. In relation to corporate income tax, the Company, as a multinational group w ith several types of transactions occurring betw een legal entities in different jurisdictions, must comply w ith the OECD requirements regarding transfer pricing and transfer pricing documentation, as w ell as w ith new legislation being implemented as a result of the BEPS framew ork. BEPS, as detailed above refers to tax avoidance strategies that exploit gaps and mismatches in tax rules to artificially shift profits to low or no-tax locations. These rules may, in practice and under certain circumstances, result in double taxation of income or in costs being non-deductible. 41 ----- In relation to value-added tax (""VAT""), the application of, exemption from, or refund of VAT varies according to both the jurisdiction in w hich the service is being provided and the nature of the service itself. Financial services, including the portfolio investments component of the Company's Portfolio Investments segment, are treated in many jurisdictions as tax-exempt or receive exceptional tax treatment. This may result in different interpretations regarding the possibility to recover input VAT charged to the Company by external and internal suppliers. The treatment of VAT claims included in receivables purchased from external parties also varies betw een the jurisdictions.",N/A,as_expected,2022,428
151_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our industry and business,13.1.34,Recent and future changes in Swedish tax legislation could affect our tax position.,"Sw eden has, like several other countries w here w e operate, rules relating to tax deduction of net interest costs. These rules contain, _inter alia, a general limitation of interest deductions in the corporate sector w here the cap for a deduction of net interest expenses is calculated as 30% of tax EBITDA, w ith certain exceptions. The rules apply to financial years beginning after December 31, 2018 and it can be noted that the Group has already experienced an increased tax burden in Sw eden due to these rules. The government has now decided to commission a special investigator to analyze the new rules and suggest amendments. The forthcoming investigation w ill analyze, among other things, if the purpose of the interest deduction rules is achieved and w hether the rules prevent tax planning in the intended manner. We believe the purpose of this investigation is to improve the predictability of the rules and remove some of their inherent flaw s, but it is possible that any changes w ill further restrict the Group's ability to deduct interest expenses in Sw eden. If the Company or its Sw edish subsidiaries' net interest expenses represent a substantial portion in relation to its tax EBITDA, or if additional restrictions to the deductibility of interest expenses is introduced in Sw eden, the Group's tax burden could increase, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Sw eden also has tax legislation regulating taxation of income from foreign controlled companies (""CFC"") in low tax jurisdictions. On January 1, 2019 amended Sw edish CFC-legislation entered into force, generally broadening the applicability of the rules. The amendments have been undertaken in order to comply w ith the EU anti-tax avoidance directive (EU 2016/1164). The new and stricter rules include, _inter alia, a low ered threshold for the qualifying interest stake in companies covered by the CFC-legislation, and a w ider scope of companies considered subject to CFC-taxation. Within the EU/EEA entities in several jurisdictions, including _inter alia Malta and corporations acting w ithin the banking, finance, and insurance industry in several member states may, as a result of the amended legislation, be subject to the Sw edish CFC-legislation. If the Company directly or indirectly holds participations in foreign companies qualifying for CFC-taxation, the Group's tax burden could increase, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2022,428

The performance of our portfolios is tested regularly. Any revaluation is charged through the profit and loss account as an adjustment to revenues. Accordingly, the value of our purchased portfolios as recorded on our statement of financial position and our revenues in our income statement may fluctuate each time w e reassess forecasted cash flow s. Our forecasted cash flow s are based on a number of assumptions. Forecasts are generated by applying historically observed decay rates to the actual gross collections achieved in recent months and also accounting for macroeconomic conditions and operational improvements, among other things. These historically observed decay rates are linked to the underlying collection fundamentals applicable at the time, including, among others, general economic conditions, the collections strategy, collections legislation and customer behavior. Any changes to these assumptions could result in revaluations w hich change the value of the portfolios on our consolidated statement of financial position and lead to the inclusion of a revaluation in our consolidated profit and loss account. While revaluations are non-cash movements, they are derived from the actual collections achieved in each individual portfolio and so affect revenue and cost of sales as a percentage of revenue. This subsequently impacts other profit and loss account line items, including gross profit, operating profit and the amount of tax on ordinary activities and can also impact our cash outflow s for tax payments. There is generally a gap betw een the point in time w hen w e purchase a portfolio and the point in time w hen w e begin earning returns on the purchased portfolio as w e do not alw ays have control over w hen an agreement to purchase a portfolio w ill come into force and w e need to then locate customers, build a consolidated profile of each such customer's circumstances and formulate an appropriate repayment solution before w e can start to collect on a purchased portfolio.

If any one of these events occurs, the trading price of the Notes could decline and we may not be able to pay interest or principal on the Notes when due and you could lose part or all or part of your investment. The order in which these risks are presented does not necessarily reflect the likelihood of their occurrence or the magnitude of their potential severity or impact upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. The historical amounts set forth in this Offering Memorandum do not reflect the revaluation following the CarVal-Kistefos Transaction, and do not reflect the impact of the UK Acquisition. See “Summary–Recent Developments–CarVal-Kistefos Transaction” and “Summary—Recent Developments—UK Acquisition” for more information. This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that are based on assumptions and estimates and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including, but not limited to, the risks described below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._",N/A,as_expected,2022,428

We provide clients w ith a complete value proposition across the entire CMS value chain, built on our longstanding commitment to fair and ethical collection. We leverage our economies of scale, digitization and large information databases as a part of a larger transformation strategy, ONE Intrum, to increase efficiency, effectively recycle our cash flow s and focus on emerging commercial opportunities. Since January 1, 2020, w e have operated our business, and presented our financial information, on the basis of three segments: (i) the Credit Management Services segment, (ii) the Strategic Markets segment and (iii) the Portfolio Investments segment. As described below, our three segments allow us to offer a full range of services covering a client's entire CMS value chain, w ith each segment also w orking complementarily to drive business and improve data and expertise in other segments. Prior to January 1, 2020, w e operated our business w ith tw o service lines, Credit Management Services and Portfolio Investments, and w ith a focus on four geographic regions. How ever, in this Offering Memorandum, financial information previously presented under the service line of Credit Management Services for the year ended December 31, 2019 has now been presented in the tw o segments of Credit Management Services and Strategic Markets in our current three segment organization.

For the tw elve months ended September 30, 2022, our revenue w as SEK 18,797 million (€1,837 million equivalent) and Cash EBITDA w as SEK 13,179 million (€1,288 million equivalent). See ""Summary _Historical _Consolidated Financial and Other Data.""_ - **_Credit M anagement Services segment._** Through our Credit Management Services segment, we employ tailored debt collection strategies and solutions to maximize cash flow streams from loans and other overdue receivables for clients w ho have decided to outsource their debt collection function, other than in the countries included in our Strategic Markets segment. In addition to, and generally in combination w ith, collection services, w e provide capabilities in alternative solutions and offer clients a w ide range of value-added services prior to loans and receivables becoming overdue. Our value 60 ----- added service offering includes credit information and analysis on individuals and companies to help our clients assess their potential customers' payment capacity, data extraction and modelling, selection and scoring of potential customers, our RES offering and a full suite of services relating to accounts receivable, including invoicing, reminders and account ledger services.

As of January 1, 2020, w e simplified our organizational structure, transitioning aw ay from tw o service lines that focused on four geographic regions and establishing Strategic Markets as our third segment alongside our Credit Management Services segment and Portfolio Investments segment. The establishment of the Strategic Markets segment reflects our strategic grow th in recent years. Our Strategic Markets segment focuses on providing CMS in our Brazilian, Greek, Italian and Spanish operations, w ith the Greek, Italian and Spanish markets in particular being large and important markets in w hich w e have similar operations based on partnerships w ith major financial institutions, including our Piraeus Partnership in Greece and our Intesa Partnership in Italy.

Upon purchase of defaulted receivables, w e put in place long-term debt collection measures aimed at helping customers become debt-free w ith Intrum as w e w ork together to reduce their debt. In line w ith our core values, w hich are based on an empathetic and ethical approach to helping indebted customers become debt free in a respectful manner, w e interact w ith every customer to craft solutions on the basis of their individual circumstances, for example through instalment plans that take account of each consumer's payment capacity. Our Portfolio Investments segment also houses our REO offering. Either (i) in the course of its recovery activities for secured loans (or infrequently in relation to unsecured loans w ith personal guarantees), or (ii) as an outright investment strategy, w e directly or indirectly, and sometimes alongside our co-investors, hold title to real estate (REO) that are expected to be eventually resold. We arrange for the sale of the REOs using internal and external resources and netw orks. Our REO ow nership/exposure is concentrated in Spain and Hungary and together w ith our co-investors, it has a current book value of SEK 296 million (excluding contribution by our joint ventures). For the tw elve months ended September 30, 2022, w e generated revenue of SEK 8,445 million (€825 million equivalent) from our Portfolio Investments segment.

Our complete range of services helps attract and retain clients and increases the breadth and depth of collectible data, in turn supporting the creation of tailored collection strategies and development of analytical capabilities to more accurately price portfolios.

151_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,899,MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,899.2,Significant factors affecting results of operations,899.2.1,Volume of clients outsourcing their credit optimization and collection requirements and the level of debt available for purchase,"Providing an integrated service offering throughout the late payment value-chain, from optimization to collection and purchasing, is key to attracting and retaining clients. We believe that onboarding clients at the outset of their transaction processes by providing them w ith credit optimization and collection services has been crucial to our success. Our results of operations are linked to the volume of companies seeking to outsource their creditrelated offerings and to the overall level of loans and other overdue receivables available for purchase and thirdparty collection in the markets and industry sectors in w hich w e operate. During the periods under review, the volume of credit management services that w e have provided and the volume of loans and other overdue receivables available for purchase experienced a temporary decrease largely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but have since demonstrated a normalization trajectory each as described below . We believe that in general this trend w ill continue due to three main factors: (i) an increasing consumer expectation that businesses w ill offer alternatives to direct, one-off payments and as a result an increasing number of businesses seeking to offer alternative payment methods in order to remain competitive in their respective markets; (ii) businesses increasingly choosing to sell NPLs and other overdue receivables as a result of regulatory pressure to deleverage and businesses' desire for improved and predictable cash flow s; and (iii) an increase in the number of businesses outsourcing credit optimization and collection services or selling overdue receivables in order to focus on their core operations, creating a grow ing sophistication gap in debt collection capabilities w hen compared to credit management providers. In 2020, primarily as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, w e observed a temporary dow nturn in CMS volumes and a short-term reduction in the supply of new NPL portfolios. The decrease in CMS volumes w as in part due to formal payment moratoria and informal payment holidays. We believe the shortterm reduction in the supply of new NPL portfolios w as the result of elevated uncertainty on pricing and quality and the provision of temporary reliefs on balance sheet management w hich may have made financial institutions less likely to sell their non-performing exposures. Ultimately, however, the evolution of NPL stock depends on the macroeconomic situations of the countries in question. For example, in a favorable macroeconomic environment, NPL generation is more muted, as evidenced by NPL levels over the few years prior to COVID-19. In a dow nturn, such as is currently being experienced or expected on a global level also due to, global supply chain disruptions and shortages of commodities, inflationary pressures, the effects of the Russian invasion of Ukraine (including sanctions and counter sanctions) and other factors, w e w ould expect eventually to see an increase in the generation of new NPLs. For further discussion of key NPL supply drivers, see ""Industry Overview—Key Drivers of the Credit Management _Industry."" Separately, moratoriums on certain debt related legal proceedings, w hich w ere introduced in some of_ the jurisdictions in w hich w e operate, caused temporary delays in the business volumes that w e service on behalf of clients. COVID-19-related reductions of activity in the legal systems in certain jurisdictions has also resulted in collections and cash flow delays in our operations in certain countries. At present all COVID-19 related moratoria relevant for our operations have been terminated.",N/A,as_expected,2022,428
151_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,899,MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,899.2,Significant factors affecting results of operations,899.2.2,M aking portfolio investments at the right price,"Our ability to purchase portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables at the right price has been and w ill continue to be a key driver of our results of operations. Our portfolio investments consist primarily of portfolios of loans, real estate portfolios and other overdue receivables purchased at prices significantly below the nominal total collectible value of the portfolios and recognized at amortized cost. We expect to achieve collections in excess of the portfolio purchase price. As of September 30, 2022 our ERC w as 2.1 times the book value of our portfolio investments and our book value of portfolio investments together w ith the book value of our joint ventures and real estate assets, but not including co-investor book value, w as SEK 39.7 billion. When purchasing portfolios, w e engage in an extensive valuation of the portfolio in order to determine the optimal price to offer the client. See ""Business—Operations and service offerings—Portfolio Investments _segment—Purchase of overdue receivables."" Our investment criteria for real estate portfolios differs from our_ investment criteria for our loan and overdue receivables portfolios due to the unique aspects of the real estate market, including valuations of the underlying assets and collateral, our risk exposure to price and value fluctuations in applicable real estate markets and the unique legislative and enforcement regimes applicable to real property. Our performance is dependent on our ability to purchase portfolios of loans, real estate portfolios and other overdue receivables that meet our investment criteria and that generate an appropriate return on our portfolio investments. After purchasing a portfolio, our performance is further dependent on our ability to generate gross collection levels at or in excess of expectations for the specific portfolio. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, 2019, and 2018, our average collection of forecast w as 111% (comprising quarterly average collection of forecast during 2021 of 105%, 116%, 112% and 113%), 112%, 112%, and 110% respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, our average collection of forecast w as 110% (comprising quarterly average collection of forecast during 2021 of 110%, 115%, 106%) and 111%, respectively. For the tw elve months ended September 30, 2022 our average collection of forecast w as 111%. For the three months ended September 30, 2022, our average collection of forecasts w as 106%. During the periods under review, w e expanded the scope of our investments to also include Unlikely-toPay (""UTP"") in Italy. In the second quarter of 2019, w e also acquired Solvia, w hich offers real estate management 62 ----- services in the Spanish market, and, in the fourth quarter of 2019, w e acquired our interest in Intrum Hellas REO Solutions S.A., w hich, among other services, offers real estate management services in the Greek market. Secured claims entail additional complexity w ith respect to pricing and forecasting due to different risk and collection profiles w hen compared to the unsecured loans and receivables that have historically been our main focus. As of September 30, 2022, 7% of the book value of our portfolio investments (excluding joint ventures and real estate) consisted of secured loans. In 2008 and 2009, the global financial crisis reduced the propensity of debt originators to sell overdue receivables as prices decreased and also made it more difficult for debt purchasers to obtain funding for portfolio investments. During this period, collection levels on certain portfolios decreased in some countries thereby reducing overall portfolio performance. This impacted not only the pricing of new portfolios, but also the valuation of existing portfolios. We w ere partly shielded from these challenging market conditions due to our integrated offering, in particular our debt collection services. Our full-service business model allow ed us to adapt our business mix and meet client demands. In contrast, pure debt purchasers that lacked in-house debt collection operations w ere unable to adapt in this manner. Similarly, w hen the global market started to recover in 2010 and pricing levels became increasingly attractive for sellers, w e w ere able to respond rapidly by increasing our portfolio purchases. We believe that our integrated business model allow s us to adapt to changing market environments and to fluctuations in supply and demand across our client offering. During the tw elve months ended September 30, 2022, w e invested SEK 8,943 million in the purchase of portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables, including deliveries under forw ard flow agreements, including investments held through joint ventures, w ith an aggregate total collectible value of SEK 159,580 million. As of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, w e had ERC of SEK 74,337 million and SEK 82,832 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, the portfolio investments book value in our consolidated statement of financial position w as SEK 31,478 million and SEK 35,161 million, respectively. The majority of portfolios for sale are offered to the market through competitive tender processes. There are tw o principal models for purchasing portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables: (i) one-off agreements and (ii) forw ard flow agreements. In a one-off agreement, w e purchase a portfolio of claims in a single standalone transaction. In a forw ard flow agreement, w e buy claims from a client on an ongoing basis at a pre-defined price or price range for a given volume and quality. We typically enter into forw ard flow agreements w ith partners w ith w hom w e have established relationships, w hich gives us confidence around quality and volume, and based on past experience w e expect that many of these contracts w ill be renew ed. Forw ard flow agreements are beneficial to our business because they offer a predictable and certain flow of claims though they are typically not long-term contracts and so do not provide long-term assurance on purchasing levels. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, w e invested SEK 1,185 million and SEK 1,474 million, respectively, in forw ard flow agreements and for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, w e invested SEK 709 million and SEK 949 million, respectively, in forw ard flow agreements. Our ability to make portfolio investments is dependent on our internally generated funding resources and access to adequate and attractive financing at the time portfolios become available for purchase. We currently fund purchases of portfolios, w orking capital needs and other expenditures w ith cash generated from operating activities, borrow ings under the Revolving Credit Facility or additional bank or capital markets debt. In certain cases, w e also partner w ith co-investors to purchase portfolios, w hich reduce our funding requirements proportionately to our economic interest in the given portfolios and, in some cases, adds additional off -balance sheet leverage. Revenue and earnings derived from co-investments are recognized based on proportionate participations in co-investment structures. See ""—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Off balance sheet arrangements."" We believe that w e w ill continue to be able to generate funding resources and obtain financing subject to market conditions. See ""— _Liquidity and capital resources"" for additional information on funding of our portfolio purchases and ""—Significant factors affecting results of operations—Economic conditions"" for additional information on the effects of economic_ conditions on our business and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2022,428
151_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,899,MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,899.2,Significant factors affecting results of operations,899.2.3,Competition and pricing,"Competition and pricing levels in the markets in w hich w e operate affect our ability to successfully and profitably offer credit optimization, payment, collection and financial services. The European credit management market is fragmented and consists of several thousand companies w ith varied profiles. The pricing element of portfolio investment and debt collection services is highly competitive across all markets, resulting in increased pricing levels for purchases and decreased pricing levels for the provision of debt collection services during the periods under review . We believe that in recent years there has been a trend tow ards increased concentration of the credit management industry w ith large, incumbent credit management companies expanding in scale as core clients, in particular financial institutions, have placed increasing value on high-quality data assets acquired over an extended period of time, robust compliance framew orks, multinational presence and long-term relationships w ith credit management companies. In addition, reputation and ethical behavior are important competitive advantages in order to maintain relationships w ith current and potential clients, particularly financial institutions. 63 ----- Unlike competitors that may not offer debt collection services or w hich have the majority of their business in one or a few European countries, our integrated and balanced operations as w ell as our pan-European presence provide an efficient tool in competitive landscapes. For example, our pan-European presence allow s us to shift our investment mix tow ards countries w ith more attractive returns at the relevant time. Similarly, w e are able to generate steady revenue and cash flow from our credit optimization, payment and collection services and as a result w e can be selective about w hich portfolios w e bid for as w e do not need to purchase portfolios that do not offer an attractive risk adjusted return simply to ensure sufficient cash flow for our operations. See ""Risk Factors—Risks related to _our industry and business—We are active in competitive markets and may be unable to continue to successfully compete with businesses that may offer more attractive prices or benefit from less expensive funding or pursue lower return requirements than us.""_",N/A,as_expected,2022,428
151_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,899,MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,899.2,Significant factors affecting results of operations,899.2.4,Gross collection levels,"We have a large and diverse collection of portfolios that have delivered consistent and stable revenue over time. We primarily generate revenue from: (i) fees received for credit information and payment services; (ii) fees and commissions received from claims on w hich w e perform debt collection services; and (iii) payments received from customers linked to claims in our portfolio investments. The ability and w illingness of a customer to pay depends on several factors, including employment status, availability of funds and asset ow nership. We believe that our business benefits from both the quality of the data that w e build about a customer's circumstances as w ell as the analysis w e are able to perform on customer data to assess ability and w illingness to pay and, ultimately, to determine the best collections strategy for each customer. During the COVID-19 pandemic, dow nw ard pressure on gross collections w as partially offset by the high level of online and automated payments available across our netw ork. At present w e observe increasing challenges in collections from invoices, particularly utilities, in the context of a more challenging macroeconomic environment w hich is also expected to decrease average collectability of claims. _Gross collection levels in our Credit Management Services segment and Strategic Markets segment_ The volume of loans and other overdue receivables that clients outsource to us and, consequently, our revenue from debt collection services, is linked to our relationships w ith our debt collection clients and our ability to demonstrate strong gross collection levels. Different types of asset classes and different jurisdictions have different collection profiles and contract types. We offer flexible pricing arrangements to our debt collection clients that are tailored to the client's specific circumstances and business needs as w ell as to the relevant claims. We believe that the benefits of our claims collection strategy are evident through our many long-standing client relationships in w hich w e are seen as a trusted, important and strategic business partner. For more information about our debt collection services, see ""—Key operating metrics for Credit Management Services segment and _Strategic Markets segment.""_ 64 ----- _Gross collection levels on portfolio investments_ We purchase debt portfolios at significant discount to the total collectible value on portfolio investments and typically collect multiples of the purchase price. After w e purchase a portfolio, w e typically manage collection on that portfolio in-house. Revenue generated from claims in our purchased portfolios is directly impacted by the gross collection levels that w e are able to achieve. As w e keep all funds collected on purchased portfolios, w e are able to strategically allocate additional resources and costs to optimize collection and increase collection levels on a given portfolio until it reaches the stage w hen the resources and costs required exceed expected revenue, at w hich stage w e assign the portfolio to our debt surveillance department. We believe that our ability to convert nonpaying claims into paying claims illustrates the high degree of accuracy of our data assets and analytical capabilities and the effectiveness of our scalable, multi-channel collections approach. We further believe that w e operate our forecasts w ith an appropriate balance betw een prudent pricing and strong collection performance. Due to the conditions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and the global impact it has had, w e pushed back our expected collection timing and thereby reduced the forecast for collections on our unsecured portfolios (w hich accounted for 93% of all portfolio investments excluding JVs and REO during the tw elve month period ending September 30, 2022) in March 2020 for the follow ing 3 to 12 months, although at a global level, after experiencing an initial shock to collections, w e outperformed these forecasts and performed in line w ith the forecast prior to the adjustment. For our secured portfolios, due to closures of courts, ban on enforcements and initial shock to the property market, we w rote dow n our secured portfolio by SEK 168 million representing 8.1% of the total secured book value at the time.

These acquisitions have allow ed us to enhance our business intelligence capabilities, collection related local know ledge and generate steady streams of revenue. From January 1, 2019 to September 30, 2022, significant acquisitions and co-investments include: - In April 2021 an Italian bank, BPER Banca, transferred a portfolio of Unlikely-to-Pays (""UTPs"") portfolios to a new ly established special purpose vehicle (SPV) that financed the purchase of the portfolios by issuing notes. The Group, through an Irish designated activity company co-invested in the notes issued by the SPV w ith another investor. The Group subscribed to 20% of the notes issued, the remaining 80% being subscribed to by another investor. - In November 2021, the Group completed a co-investment w ith another investor in Italy of a secured leasing portfolio w ith a gross book value of €1.1 billion. The Group subscribed to its share of 28.5% Mezzanine Notes and 28.5% Junior Notes, w ith 66.5% Mezzanine and Junior Notes subscribed to by the other investor. - Intesa/Ithaca: In April 2018, w e entered into a partnership agreement w ith Intesa pertaining to the establishment of a shared Italian collection business and the securitization of non-performing loans originated by Intesa, in w hich context, w e acquired a majority 51% holding in an Italian collection business, Intrum Italy and in w hich Intesa retains a 49% holding. At the same time Intrum together w ith CarVal Investors acquired 51% of a portfolio of overdue receivables from Intesa, w hich is held by Penelope, an Italian special purpose vehicle, as described below . Our interest in Penelope is held through a joint company, Ithaca Investment DAC (the ""Intesa JV""), in w hich w e initially ow ned profit participating notes corresponding to 80% of the capital of the Intesa JV. The Intesa JV is subject, by agreement, to joint control w ith our partners (and includes certain protection for Intrum on certain significant decision items) and w e therefore report our interest in the jointly ow ned platform as a participation in a joint venture. The Intesa JV has invested in junior notes and mezzanine loans issued by Penelope. Penelope has invested in overdue receivables acquired from Intesa. Penelope also controls the property company, Savoy Reoco S.R.L., w hich assumes control of seized collateral in the form of properties. On December 29, 2021, Penelope was restructured and refinanced w ith longer duration senior notes. The senior notes are eligible for a state guarantee, Garanzia Cartolarizzazione Sofferenze (""GACS""). As part of the transaction, Intesa JV's holding in the mezzanine and junior notes increased from 51% to 95%. In addition, Intrum reduced its holdings in the profit participating notes from 80% to 62.5% in Intesa JV. This resulted in a loss of SEK 40 million for Intrum. We also entered into a derivative contract w ith certain funds managed or advised by CarVal Investors (the “CarVal Derivative”), w hich allow ed us to acquire the latter's 37.5% profit participating notes in Intesa JV from July 1, 2023 to December 31, 2027 and also required us to do so once gross collections of SEK 12.8 billion had been achieved, or on December 31, 2027. The CarVal Derivative w as settled concurrently w ith the CarVal-Kistefos Transaction in November 2022. Follow ing the CarVal-Kistefos Transaction, our co-investor in the Intesa JV is Kistefos Investors.

For example, adverse economic conditions and increased levels of unemployment may lead to higher default rates on claims, w hich may positively impact our ability to purchase portfolios w ith attractive returns by increasing the stock of portfolios available for purchase. Similarly, negative economic developments may increase the amount of loans and other overdue receivables held by our debt collection clients, w hich may increase the number of claims that clients w ant to outsource to us for collection. If adverse economic conditions materially reduce the ability of customers to enter into transactions or repay their debts, our revenue from credit optimization services, debt collection services and debt purchasing could decrease. Adverse economic conditions could also reduce some debt originators' w illingness to sell overdue receivables at prevailing market prices, w hich could decrease the overall volume of portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables available for us to purchase or could alternatively pressure some debt originators to sell portfolios in order to free up capital, w hich may increase the overall volume of loans and other overdue receivables available for us to purchase. Follow ing the 2008 global financial crisis, for example, the industry experienced dramatic slow dow ns in purchases of portfolios follow ed by increases in the sale of portfolios during subsequent periods as debt originators sought to free up capital. Unfavorable economic conditions may also impact our ability to obtain financing to purchase portfolios. The Russian military invasion in Ukraine beginning in February 2022 has already had a negative effect on both European and global economies and led to a large degree of uncertainty. The further development of this armed conflict, related sanctions and counter-sanctions, as w ell as their long-term repercussions on the global economy and markets are still unclear. Further sanctions against Russia could also have material adverse effects on the broader European economic environment in w hich w e operate. Specifically, the EU ban on oil and oil product imports from Russia (w hich is expected to take full effect in February 2023), the shutoff of gas flow s through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and other reductions in oil and gas imports from Russia have had, and could continue to have, negative effects on the economies of various European countries w hich strongly rely on such imports and have exacerbated, and could continue to exacerbate, inflationary pressures. General inflation in various European countries has risen to levels not experienced in recent decades. General inflation, w hich may result in currency volatility, rising interest rates and w ages, and fiscal and policy interventions by governments in reaction to such events, could have negative impacts on our business by increasing economic hardship on our customers (reducing their ability to make payments at the same levels or rendering them unable to make payments at all) and increasing our operating costs and costs to borrow. Additionally, Europe has entered a period of significant economic slow dow n, with some countries expected to enter recession, w hich could push unemployment rates higher and result in a dow nturn in the housing markets. Harder financing criteria make it also more difficult to dispose of assets. See ""Risk Factors—Risks related to our industry and business—The economic conditions in the markets in which we operate affect our business_ ."" The COVID-19 pandemic created significant uncertainties and risk, adversely affecting economies on a global basis as w ell as on a specific basis in the markets in w hich w e are active. The spread of COVID-19 impacted our segmental and regional operations in different w ays, w ith Strategic Markets being the most adversely affected. In early 2020 w e extended our collection forecasts inside the year ended December 31, 2020, pushing back our expected collection timing. How ever, overall collections in the year ended December 31, 2020 exceeded these revised collection forecasts, w ith amounts collected in Greece, Italy and Spain slightly under the revised forecast and amounts collected in the remaining countries significantly above the revised forecast. In the year ended December 31, 2020, w e also experienced marginally higher earnings from joint ventures and underw riting return levels that w ere materially higher than levels prior to COVID-19. For our secured portfolios, due to closures of courts, ban on enforcements and initial shock to the property market, w e w rote dow n our secured portfolio by SEK 68 ----- 168 million representing 8.1% of the total secured book value at the time. An additional SEK 52 million w rite-down w as made in the first half of 2021 to further reflect the impact. How ever, financial performance in the Strategic Markets segment for the year ended December 31, 2021 improved w hen compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 financial performance due in part to the reopening of the court systems in Greece, Italy and Spain in May 2020 as w ell as by our strict internal cost control measures. Financial performance in the Credit Management Services segment for the year ended December 31, 2021 w as w eaker when compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 financial performance due to residual effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including formal payment moratoria and informal payment holidays that lasted at least part of 2021 in many cases, though most had ended by December 31, 2021. Overall, operating earnings and operating margin in our Portfolio Investments segment increased to SEK 5,043 million (€493 million equivalent) and 63% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to SEK 3,251 million (€318 million equivalent) (using SEK 10.2345 to €1.00) and 46% for the year ended December 31, 2020, due primarily to the diversity and breadth of the segment's portfolio. We also believe that our pipeline remains at a good level and, additionally, that our broad geographical presence and w ide variety of client solutions gives us a high degree of diversification. As part of our third quarter 2022 revaluation process, the book value of our Intesa joint venture was reduced by SEK 2,460 million, due to low ered collection expectations on specific investment portfolios. As a direct consequence, client relationships w as reduced by SEK 393 million and a fair value loss on derivative amounted to SEK 95 million. In the fourth quarter of 2022, w e w ill further reduce the book value of the Intesa JV recognized in our financial statements by approximately SEK 3.1 billion and recognize an impairment loss on related customer relationships of approximately SEK 0.2 billion. This is to reflect the updated valuation of our 62.5% exposure in the Intesa JV implied by the CarVal-Kistefos Transaction in November 2022. We w ill also low er ERC associated w ith the Intesa JV by approximately SEK 5.4 billion. Concurrently w ith the CarVal-Kistefos Transaction, w e settled the CarVal Derivative, resulting in a cash loss of approximately SEK 1.1 billion. See “Summary–Recent Developments– _CarVal-Kistefos Transaction” for more information._ Improved economic conditions are likely to low er default rates on loans, w hich could negatively impact the grow th of the stock of portfolios available for us to purchase. Improved economic conditions could also decrease the amount of loans and other overdue receivables held by our debt collection clients, w hich could negatively impact revenue generated through out debt collection services. Conversely, improved economic conditions and decreased levels of unemployment: (i) imply that consumers w ill have higher income and a corresponding increased ability to pay debt due on a timely basis, w hich could result in our experiencing low er costs to collect and (ii) are likely to drive higher consumption and encourage clients to offer deferred payment to customers w hich w ould likely improve demand for our credit optimization services. On January 31, 2020, the w ithdraw al of the United Kingdom from the EU became effective and the United Kingdom entered into a transition period, w hich completed on December 31, 2020. The exit of the United Kingdom from the EU (""Brexit""), continues to contribute to a degree of political uncertainty w ithin the EU, the United Kingdom, and international financial markets generally. Additionally, the rise in government bond yields, as a result of tighter monetary policy, has again brought up w orries over debt sustainability, in various countries in the EU and the United Kingdom. The resulting political and economic uncertainty could also lead to a departure, or heighten the risk of departure, from the Economic and Monetary Union of the EU by one or more Eurozone countries, the abandonment of the euro as a currency or the imposition of significant restrictions to, or the elimination of, barrierfree access amongst EU Member States or w ithin the EEA overall. This continued uncertainty could have a significant negative effect on consumer and market confidence. In addition, political and economic uncertainty in the United Kingdom as a result of the recent resignations of tw o Prime Ministers and drastic shifts in fiscal policy have had, and could continue to have, an adverse effect on the United Kingdom's economy. In light of the exposure that w e have to the EU and the euro through our euro-denominated borrow ings, derivative instruments and cash flow s, and to the United Kingdom and the British pound sterling given our Intrum UK operations, any events adversely affecting the stability of the Eurozone or the United Kingdom or the euro or the British pound sterling could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We have historically undertaken a range of initiatives that have improved our collections and margins and that w e believe w ill continue to improve our resilience and long-term business performance. See ""Summary—Our _Strengths."" Margins in our Credit Management Services segment remained stable through 2021 but decreased_ during the course of the nine months ended September 30, 2022 due to increased costs. In 2020 w e benefitted from savings from the prior efficiency improvement program and tighter cost control offsetting low er revenues that resulted from COVID-19. Temporarily, some countries experienced low er business volumes and easing of payment terms for their customers, adversely impacting revenues. Margins in our Strategic Markets segment w ere impacted in 2020 due to COVID-19 significantly impacting southern Europe, w hich led to country-w ide lockdow ns and reduced activity in the legal systems for periods of time resulting in delays in cash flow s. Therefore the savings from the earlier efficiency improvement program and the Piraeus Partnership completed in October 2019 supported the margin during 2020 and 2021. How ever, the margin decreased during the course of the nine months ended September 30, 2022 due to increased costs, also impacted by exchange rate, costs to support the ONE Intrum transformation, as w ell as costs supporting future grow th. The collection cost ratios in our Portfolio Investments segment for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 w ere 24% and 30% respectively. The collection cost ratios in our Portfolio Investments segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 w ere 25% and 28%, respectively. Collection cost ratio is also impacted by the varying characteristics of the portfolios we purchase and the timing of portfolio purchases throughout the year. The group EBIT-margin therefore decreased from 36% in the year ended December 31, 2021 to 34% in the tw elve months ended September 30, 2022. Operational efficiency is key to our business model and a primary advantage of our business compared to competitors as w ell as financial institutions and other clients w ho handle their debt collection in-house. In the initial stages of the debt collection process, w e estimate the creditw orthiness of a group of consumers based on historical data and anticipate their payment habits and behaviors, a process that w e refer to as ""Scoring.""

The process is tailored to account for specific circumstances and behaviors and also to minimize the impact on the customer relationship. For more information on our Scoring process, see ""Business—Operations and service offerings—Credit Management Services— _Collection services.""

The Group prospectively adopted this interpretation w ith effect from January 1, 2021.

Previously, the benefit w as attributable to the full service period and the pension obligation covered all employees. As a result of the interpretation, the pension obligation and service costs are now only computed for employees w ho are at least 46 years old and w ill complete 16 years of continuous service.

151_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,899,MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,899.10,Significant factors affecting comparability,899.10.4,Recognition of portfolio investments,"Portfolio investments consist of portfolios of delinquent debt purchased at prices significantly below the nominal receivable. In accordance w ith the rules for loans and receivables under IFRS 9, portfolio investments are recognized at amortized cost according to the effective interest rate model. The current rules for portfolio investments require that w e report these according to an EIR model. In accordance w ith IFRS 9, acquired creditimpaired receivables can be reported at a higher recognized value than cost if our estimates of future cash flows change. Income from portfolio investments is recognized in the income statement as the collected amount less amortization. The collection is often performed by the same personnel w ho handle collections and debt surveillance on behalf of external clients w ithin the Credit Management Services segment and Strategic Markets segment. The cost of collection is debited internally at market price and expensed in the income statement for the Portfolio Investments segment as a cost of services. Reporting follow s the effective interest method, w here the carrying value of each portfolio corresponds to the present value of all projected future cash flow s discounted by an initial EIR determined on the date the portfolio w as acquired, based on the relation betw een purchase price cost and the projected future cash flow s on the acquisition date. Changes in the portfolio investments book value are recognized as amortization for the period and included in the income statement on the revenue line. Compensation received from debt originators due to rejected cases and price adjustments made to purchased portfolios are recorded as an adjustment to the acquisition cost. In connection w ith the purchase of each portfolio of receivables, a projection for a period of 180 months is made of the portfolio's cash flow s. Cash flow s include the loan amount, reminder fees, collection fees and late interest that, based on a probability assessment, are expected to be received from debtors, less forecast collection costs. With this forecast and the purchase price (including transaction costs) as a basis, each portfolio is assigned an initial EIR that is then used to discount cash flow s through the life of the portfolio. Cash flow actual performance is compared against projections and monitored on a monthly basis for all portfolios, although adjustments to projections are typically only made after the first year. Projections are updated based on, among other things, achieved collection results, agreements reached w ith debtors on instalment plans and macroeconomic information. Cash flow projections are made at the portfolio level, since each portfolio of receivables consists of a small number of homogeneous amounts. On the basis of the updated cash flow projections and initial EIR, a new carrying value for the portfolio is calculated in the closing accounts. The effects of changes in cash flow forecasts are referred to as revaluations and treated symmetrically, _i.e., both increases and decreases in forecast flow s affect a given portfolio's portfolio investments book value and,_ as a result, earnings. Portfolios may be recognized at higher than cost if future cash flow forecasts change. Although selling portfolios of portfolio investments is not a part of our business model, w hen such sales do occur as an exception, the resulting sales price received for the portfolio is reported in the same w ay as if it had been collected from the debtors. The entire remaining carrying values of the portfolios are then recognized as amortization. From time to time, w e also purchase portfolios on a forw ard flow basis. In a forw ard flow agreement, we agree to buy claims from a client on an ongoing basis at a pre-defined price or price range for a given volume and quality. Claims under forw ard flow agreements can be delivered on w eekly, monthly or quarterly basis and the EIR of these claims is calculated per batch delivered. Each delivery under a forw ard flow agreement is treated as an individual portfolio purchase, using our ow n purchase cost and our ow n EIR calculation.",N/A,as_expected,2022,428

Indications of positive or negative revaluation primarily include any significant deviation against the currently active forecast for the portfolio, but also take into account an assessment of groups of customers experiencing financial difficulty, default of interest or principal payments, the probability that customers w ill enter into bankruptcy, debt restructuring or other financial 73 ----- reorganization and observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flow s, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate w ith defaults. Conversely, there can also be a positive revaluation in the event that a portfolio displays objective evidence of expected cash flow s above the currently active forecast. In practice, a number of portfolios are identified each quarter for potential revaluation. Generally, portfolios w ill be selected for potential revaluation only w here (i) w e have ow ned such portfolio for at least 12 months, (ii) net collections in the past 12 months, or since the latest revaluation w ithin the past 12 months, for such portfolio have deviated more than 10% positively or negatively against the active forecast, and (iii) net collections in the past 12 months for such portfolio have exceeded €100,000. Portfolios that do not fulfill all four of these criteria are not considered for revaluation unless a special request is made by country or regional management. Portfolios w hich fulfill all four criteria are considered as candidates for a potential revaluation and are analyzed by our staff at group and local levels to determine if the deviation in the past indicates a need to revise the forecast for the future. New forecasts may be generated using agreed-upon statistical methods. All changes in active collection forecasts are then signed off and agreed by our revaluation committee. All changes to the forecast lead to a book value adjustment. On a yearly basis all portfolios w ith 10% deviation are review ed and revalued. In 2020 our collection performance w as impacted by the economic dow nturn and closure of certain legal functions in certain of our key markets caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We have reflected this impact through our book value revaluations processes. In the year ended December 31, 2020, w e w rote dow n our portfolio investment by net SEK 33 million, w hich is 0.1% of our portfolio investment carrying value as of December 31, 2020.

An additional SEK 52 million w rite-dow n w as made in the first half of 2021 to further reflect the impact. The revaluations w ere done on a market level to reflect the conditions present in the market at the time of the revaluation. Additionally, as part of our quarterly revaluation process, w e have identified negative adjustments due to low ered collection expectations on specific investment portfolios that negatively impacted our profit and loss account as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The book value of our Intesa joint venture was reduced by SEK 2,460 million, and as a direct consequence, client relationships reduced by SEK 393 million and a fair value loss on derivative amounted to SEK 95 million. In the fourth quarter of 2022, w e w ill further reduce the book value of the Intesa JV recognized in our financial statements by approximately SEK 3.1 billion and recognize an impairment loss on related customer relationships of approximately SEK 0.2 billion. This is to reflect the updated valuation of our 62.5% exposure in Intesa JV implied by the CarVal-Kistefos Transaction in November 2022.

We are currently party to the follow ing joint venture arrangements. _Ithaca Investment DAC (Intesa JV)_ In April 2018, w e entered into a partnership agreement w ith Intesa pertaining to the establishment of a shared Italian collection business and the securitization of non-performing loans originated by Intesa. In the context of the Intesa Partnership: - w e acquired a majority 51% holding in a Italian collection business, Intrum Italy, to w hich Intesa contributed its service platform for overdue receivables, and Intrum contributed all of its Italian operations at the time (other than Cross Factor SpA and the holding company Lindorff Italy Srl). Intesa retains a 49% holding in Intrum Italy. In connection w ith this, Intrum Italy also entered into a 10-year exclusive servicing agreement w ith Intesa for the vast majority of Intesa's new NPL inflow during this 78 ----- period. Intesa retains a 49% holding in Intrum Italy, and w e therefore consolidate Intrum Italy's results of operations. At the same time Intrum together w ith CarVal Investors acquired 51% of a portfolio of overdue receivables from Intesa, w hich is held by Penelope, an Italian special purpose vehicle, as described below . - through a new joint company, Ithaca Investment DAC (the ""Intesa JV""), w e ow n profit participating notes corresponding to 62.5% of the capital of the Intesa JV. The Intesa JV is subject, by agreement, to controlling influence shared by Intrum and our co-investor (w hich, follow ing the CarVal-Kistefos Transaction, is Kistefos) and w e therefore report our interest in the jointly ow ned platform as a participation in a joint venture. The Intesa JV has invested in junior notes and mezzanine loans issued by Penelope. Penelope has invested in overdue receivables acquired from Intesa. Penelope also controls the property company, Savoy Reoco S.R.L., w hich assumes control of seized collateral in the form of properties. On December 29, 2021, Penelope w as restructured and refinanced w ith longer duration senior notes. The senior notes are intended to be eligible for a state guarantee, Garanzia Cartolarizzazione Sofferenze (""GACS""). As part of the transaction, Intesa JV's holding in the notes increased from 51% to 95%. In addition, Intrum reduced its holdings in the profit participating notes of the Intesa JV from 80% to 62.5% in Intesa JV. This resulted in a loss of SEK 40 million for Intrum. See ""—Acquisitions, geographic expansion and divestments ."" During the third quarter of 2022, the book value of the Intesa JV recognized in our financial statements w as reduced by SEK 2,460 million. As a direct consequence, client relationships w as reduced by SEK 393 million and a fair value loss on derivative amounted to SEK 95 million. This w as due to low ered collection expectations on specific portfolios invested via joint venture arrangements, principally our Italian joint ventures. In the fourth quarter of 2022, w e w ill further reduce the book value of the Intesa JV recognized in our financial statements by approximately SEK 3.1 billion and recognize an impairment loss on related customer relationships of approximately SEK 0.2 billion. This is to reflect the updated valuation of our 62.5% exposure in Intesa JV implied by the CarVal-Kistefos Transaction in November 2022. We w ill also low er ERC associated w ith the Intesa JV by approximately SEK 5.4 billion. Concurrently w ith the CarVal-Kistefos Transaction, w e settled the CarVal Derivative, resulting in a cash loss of approximately SEK 1.1 billion. See “Summary–Recent Developments–CarVal-Kistefos Transaction” for more information. _Other joint ventures_ We also have a number of smaller joint ventures in Spain, Italy, Greece and the Netherlands w hich are measured in the Group's consolidated financial statements using the equity method and w hich collectively as of December 31, 2021 had a carrying amount of SEK 6,437 million as show n in the table below (w hich excludes any impairments and adjustments from January 1, 2022 onw ards and do not reflect any revaluation follow ing the CarVal-Kistefos Transaction).",N/A,as_expected,2022,428

Our debt purchasing activities are driven by supply of portfolios in the market, w hich w e do not control, and our w illingness to invest in any particular available assets at the prevailing price.

Such arrangements occur routinely and include financial institutions extending loans or trade sector companies (including, _inter alia, telecommunications_ and utilities companies) issuing invoices for services rendered. When a debtor does not repay the debt according to the terms on w hich it w as extended, the debt becomes overdue. Overdue debt is a structural component of the credit industry, as debt originators typically expect a certain percentage of customers to default, and price credit accordingly. Overdue debt is either collected by the originator itself or by a credit management company, such as us.",N/A,as_expected,2022,428

One-off agreements entail buying a portfolio of claims that are received in one transaction upon payment. Forw ard flow agreements entail buying a given volume of claims at a pre-defined price or price range from a client on an ongoing basis. Selling overdue debt helps debt originators increase their liquidity, strengthen their balance sheets, release resources to focus on early-stage delinquencies and reduce operational risks, reporting requirements and regulatory demands. How overdue debt is sold is dependent on the debt originators' needs and balance sheet strategy. In the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis there w as a pressing need for financial institutions to quickly de-lever balance sheets and therefore NPL sales focused on larger one-off transactions. Over the last years, w e have observed a less immediate but continuous need for banks to improve their capitalization, and as a result w e see an increasing trend tow ards forward-flow contracts as an additional measure for banks to manage NPL portfolios on an ongoing basis. The decision to sell overdue debt can occur at one of several stages throughout the debt collection cycle, depending on the type of debt, pricing and time since default. Typically, debt is sold after more than one year in default and follow ing the performance of various non-legal and legal measures.",N/A,as_expected,2022,428

Debt can also be broken dow n by client type, specifically consumer (""B2C"") and corporate (""B2B"") debt. _Financial institution generated debt_ Consumer debt originated by financial institutions primarily consists of bank loans and typically includes mortgages, credit card loans, car loans, overdrafts and consumer loans. When such loans become more than 90 days overdue or w hen they are assessed as unlikely to be repaid in full, they are categorized as NPLs. These are typically characterized by a relatively high average value and long collection times. Typically bank loans are further divided into unsecured (for example, credit card) and secured (for example, mortgage) loans. We view the credit management services market for debt originated by the financial institutions sector as highly sophisticated. Historically, w e have focused on unsecured consumer debt originated by financial institutions, w ith an average annual collection performance for unsecured consumer collections from 2000 to 2021 of 107%. We have in recent years expanded our footprint and capabilities in the secured debt market segment. In 2016, w e acquired 85% of Aktua in Spain, w ith Santander holding the remaining 15%.

A number of credit management services are exemplified in the follow ing illustration and described in the text below . The Credit Management Services (CMS) industry can be divided into the follow ing tw o sub-segments: _Payment, information and invoice services_ Before debt originators extend credit to debtors, credit management companies provide credit scoring and other forms of credit information services such as data extraction and modelling. Credit management companies also provide payment processing services including invoice administration, subsidiary ledger accounting, invoice printing, payment reminders and invoice purchasing. These services are provided before debt is overdue. _Debt collection_ Credit management companies provide debt collection services to debt originators for overdue debt. The debt collection process consists of three phases: pre-legal (amicable), legal and enforcement and surveillance. The pre-legal phase is the first stage in debt recovery and is w here the collector seeks to find a voluntary solution w ith the debtor, for example through a payment plan. If it is unlikely that the debtor w ill pay voluntarily even if that person could afford to pay and/or w as aw are of the claim, it is assessed w hether the case should be moved to the legal and enforcement phase w here the court system is used to find a solution, for example through garnishment of w ages or sale of collateral. If the debtor is insolvent and the claim is uncollectable the case moves to the surveillance phase. During this phase, debtors are monitored for any changes in personal circumstances, such as employment status, that may allow debtors to commence payment. 93 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,428

This figure (i) does not include NPLs held by non-bank entities and therefore does not include the large volumes of NPLs sold over the years to credit funds or debt purchasers such as ourselves and (ii) includes NPLs relating to the large corporate segment, w hich w e only compete in on an opportunistic basis, as w ell as B2B debt to SMEs, both of w hich are not a part of our Core Addressable Market.

Whilst total NPL stock has decreased since the GFC, European loan stack has in fact increased at a CAGR of +5% betw een 2018 – 2021, from €16.5 trillion to €19.2 trillion. Provisioning levels over the period 20182021 has been average of 55bps, peaking at 79bps in 2020 as a result of COVID-19, resulting in continued new NPL creation by European banks. Whilst new NPLs are created by European banks on an ongoing basis, there is likely to be additional supply generated in the coming years given current deteriorating macro environment. Stage 2 loans ratio has increased from a low of 6.8% in the fourth quarter of 2019 to a peak of 9.5% in the second quarter of 2022, amid higher borrow ing costs for households.",N/A,as_expected,2022,428

The 2008 - 2010 global financial crisis accelerated the build-up of NPLs in the European banking system driven by, inter alia, increased default rates coupled w ith limited NPL sales activity. The European bank NPL stock increased from approximately €0.4 trillion in 2007 to approx imately €1.2 trillion in 2013. European bank NPL stock has subsequently decreased to approximately €0.4 trillion as of December 31, 2021 due to banks' focusing on deleveraging, primarily via debt sales, and is now at a similar level of NPLs' observed prior to the global financial crisis. The graph below show s the development in the total European NPL stock originated from financial institutions from 2008 to 2021 (in € billions) and held on European banks' balance sheets. _Source: EBA data_ The NPL ratio over this period has declined from its peak in 2013 at 6.8% to 2.0% in 2021. 95 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,428
151_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.6,Continued sale of NPLs as banks are under pressure to de-lever and not accumulate new stocks,521.6.1,,"There are a number of underlying factors for the high level of NPL sales volumes in recent years. In addition to the buildup of NPLs on banks' balance sheets, stricter regulations and increased provisioning levels have incentivized banks to de-lever and sell NPLs in recent years. Additionally, selling NPLs often provides banks w ith immediate benefits to liquidity and a positive impact to the profit and loss statements if the NPLs sold have been substantially w ritten dow n or w ritten off. Increased regulatory pressure and supervision (through, _inter alia, continuation of annual European Banking Authority stress-tests and stronger supervisory mechanisms, such as Single Supervisory Mechanism, Single Resolution Board and European Systemic Risk Board), higher capital requirements for financial institutions as a result of Revised Basel III coupled w ith the implementation of IFRS 9 and European Central Bank guidance on prudential provisioning of non-performing loans, is expected to further drive banks to strengthen their balance sheets and continue NPL sales. Minimum loss coverage for non-performing exposures under CRR (as defined below ) is currently a key regulatory issue confronting banks and their balance sheets: _Minimum loss coverage for non-performing exposures under Capital Requirements Regulation_ (""CRR"") _:_ Regulation (EU) 2019 / 630 amending the CRR came into effect April 2019, and requires banks to take an additional deduction from capital w here non-performing exposures (""NPEs"") are not sufficiently covered by other existing adjustments. An NPE, for the purposes of the new rules, includes an exposure in default per the CRR definition, exposures considered to be impaired under the accounting framew ork, an exposure under probation w here additional forbearance measures are granted or the exposure becomes more than 30 days past due, and a commitment w hich is unlikely to be repaid and a guarantee w hich is likely to be called. Under the new regulation, unsecured NPEs must be w ritten off after 3 years w hile secured NPEs must be w ritten off after 7 years. NPEs secured by residential/commercial property or guaranteed residential loans must be w ritten off after 9 years. The aim of this regulation is to encourage banks to w rite off exposures more readily, thus accelerating the clean-up of their balance sheets, as w ell as to create a secondary market for NPEs. The law, know n as the NPL backstop, requires banks to book minimum levels of provisions for NPLs based on a uniform provisioning calendar and to apply a deduction to their capital to the extent their provisions fall short. The NPL backstop w as introduced as a tool to prevent the excessive build-up of new NPLs on bank balance sheets by creating buffers w hich allow banks to promptly tackle NPLs through sales or w rite-offs. 96 ----- Given these developments, w e expect banks to increasingly manage NPLs in a proactive manner leading to more regular sales of fresher NPLs.",N/A,as_expected,2022,428

At the same time, mature credit management providers have emerged and added value to banks through their proven track record of improving recoveries and scale benefits. Debt collection requires a substantial amount of resources and know -how, and w e believe this is performed most efficiently by specialists. Consequently, credit management providers have become an integral part of the credit industry and are frequently view ed as trusted partners to their clients. We believe that this relationship w ill continue to grow in the coming years, particularly in markets w ith low er outsourcing ratios.

When view ing the competitive landscape, three factors should be considered: - _Product offering:_ Companies either offer a full-service business model and operate in all stages of the credit management value chain, or they focus on particular areas, such as debt collection or debt purchasing. - _Geographic presence: Smaller participants tend to only operate in local markets. Medium and large companies typically have broader geographical footprints w hile only a few firms, including us, have operations across multiple European countries. - _Scale: The majority of firms are small or mid-sized and have a limited geographic presence, scale, skills, experience and information. In contrast, larger firms have the necessary scale to provide a complete value proposition. Based on these considerations, the industry can be grouped into three categories of participants: (1) Integrated pan-European credit management companies We are one of the few large credit management companies in Europe, w hich w e define as being present in more than five markets w ith an integrated offering throughout the credit management value chain. These companies typically have operations in several countries and a broad value proposition, including both debt collection and debt purchasing. The large companies have experienced strong grow th and high profitability in recent years by capitalizing on scale in skills, experience, information and origination sources. The large integrated pan-European credit management companies generally have different focuses and value propositions. We believe our complete value proposition in combination w ith our focus on the financial institutions sector is attractive to potential clients and w ill enable us to capture anticipated grow th opportunities across a variety of markets in the future. (2) Regional credit management companies Most European credit management companies are SMEs active only in one or few local markets, and have varying scale and business focuses. While these companies have a presence in their domestic markets, they have a limited or non-existing international presence. This segment also consists of several thousand participants w ithout sizable operations w ho tend to focus on debt collection, as it has low er scale requirements. In addition to smaller credit management companies focusing on debt collection, there are a number of larger scale monoline 98 ----- players, w hich w e define as having a presence in less than five geographic markets and/or w ho predominantly focus on debt purchasing. (3) Portfolio investors The third group of participants in the credit management industry comprises international investors specializing in acquisitions of portfolios w ith distressed assets, such as Cerberus Capital Management, Lone Star Funds and Fortress Investment Group. The core competency of portfolio investors is the evaluation of portfolios and the raising of capital. Portfolio investors compete w ith other credit management companies in the debt purchasing segment; how ever they can also be strategic partners since they typically outsource debt collection. In recent years, w e have created several deal-specific co-investment vehicles and have acted as a co-investor together w ith portfolio investors for the relevant deal to acquire portfolios and have handled the debt collection process relating to the relevant portfolios acquired.",N/A,as_expected,2022,428

Financial institutions have high requirements defined in their supplier risk management framew orks that cover high cyber security, AML, fraud and ESG standards among others, as w ell as business continuity plans. Such requirements create a barrier for entry to new providers. - _Scale advantages: Credit management is a scalable business w ith clear operational, strategic and financial scale benefits that provide a competitive advantage. 99 ----- - _Data and pricing capabilities: A large database built over many years combined w ith strong data enhancement capabilities is valuable both for pricing portfolios and for developing effective collection strategies. 100 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,428

As a result, w e anticipate an increase in debt sales as a proportion of NPL stock. Ultimately, the evolution of NPL stock depends on the macroeconomic situations of the countries in question. For example, in a favorable macroeconomic environment, NPL generation is more muted, as evidenced by declining NPL levels over the last few years. Follow ing a dow nturn, such as is currently being experienced on a global level in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chain disruptions and shortages of commodities, inflationary pressures, the effects of the Russian invasion of Ukraine (including sanctions and counter sanctions) and other factors, we would generally expect an increase in the generation of new NPLs.

We offer our clients both CMS and financial services solutions, providing them w ith the full scope of services across the CMS value chain. We believe that our complete value proposition, geographic footprint and scale are highly attractive to existing and potential clients. For example, our Intesa Partnership included entering into a long-term servicing contract and, through a joint venture, the acquisition of an NPL portfolio. Our Piraeus Partnership also included a long-term servicing contract and the acquisition of a leading independent service platform, and subsequently through a joint venture, the acquisition of NPL portfolios. See ""Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations— _Significant factors affecting results of operations—Acquisitions, geographic expansion and divestments.""_ These transactions demonstrate the breadth of our capabilities and the attractiveness of our value proposition to our clients. Furthermore, w e see opportunities to increase our share of w allet w ith existing CMS clients by providing services to them throughout their geographic footprint and service needs. Additionally, our Credit Management Services and Strategic Markets segments provide us w ith deep insight into the portfolios of our clients and enable us to competitively price portfolios. 107 ----- - _Continued focus on acquisitions of unsecured NPL and expansion of consumer (_ ""B2C"") debt, secured _debt and real estate services. Unsecured consumer NPL sales volumes have remained high as banks_ increasingly prefer to sell their debt to trusted debt collection agencies in order to clean up their balance sheets and focus on their core business. We expect a continued high level of NPL sales, given factors such as the grow th in consumer lending and ECB regulation of NPLs. We expect to continue to deploy capital w ithin the unsecured NPL space in order to gain scale in markets w here we are not a leader and, to a lesser extent, to opportunistically enter new business areas. We expect to continue to partner w ith banks on bilaterally agreed large, complex and sensitive transactions, of w hich our Intesa Partnership and Piraeus Partnership are tw o recent examples. Additionally, secured NPL transactions have increased in recent years and represent a large portion of the NPL market.

We have a strong track record of expansion into new business areas and expanding our presence w ithin existing markets. We have established operations in 25 countries, including through partnerships and strategic transactions such as carve-outs and bolt-on acquisitions. Our Intesa Partnership established us as a leading player in late payments in Italy, one of Europe's most attractive markets, and w ith our Piraeus Partnership w e have created the first independent leading credit management platform in Greece. Based on EBA data, our geographic footprint covers 98% of European NPLs, as of December 31, 2021. We continuously assess market conditions, including, but not limited to, changes in connection w ith the COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chain disruptions and shortages of commodities, inflationary pressures, the effects of the Russian invasion of Ukraine (including sanctions and counter sanctions), to ensure w e invest prudently. Going forw ard, w e w ill continue to proactively evaluate opportunities to gain market share in existing markets w here we currently do not hold leading positions and, to a lesser extent, opportunistically enter new business areas, for example through carve-outs and targeted acquisitions. When entering new business areas, our strategy is typically based on a cautious first entry: w e start small and increase our investments as our insight and experience in a particular market increases. Moreover, w e often strengthen our local know ledge and databases through business acquisitions and/or carve-out transactions (as w e have previously done in the United Kingdom, Spain, Poland, Italy and Greece). For example, one method w e employ to enter a new market involves acquiring a company w ith existing debt servicing capabilities and data, operating the company to develop further know ledge and data capabilities and then leveraging this data and market know ledge to price and purchase debt in the new ly entered market.

Expanding both organically and through acquisitions, by the 1980s its value proposition included a comprehensive range of services for credit administration, including collection, financial and administrative services and factoring. In 1982, Justitia Inkasso och Juridiska byrå AB changed its name to Intrum Justitia AB (publ). In the years follow ing, Intrum Justitia continued to expand, both through acquisitions and organic grow th, to become one of Europe's leading credit management companies.

Collection services generate the greatest proportion of revenue for this segment.

We also undertake the same debt collection processes for our ow n portfolios. In the initial stages of the debt collection process, w e use our scoring process to estimate the creditw orthiness of a group of consumers based on historical data, w hich allow s us to anticipate their payment habits and behaviors. See ""Management Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— _Significant factors affecting results of operations—Collection costs and operational efficiency."" Scoring allow s us_ 110 ----- to predict the likelihood that a customer w ill pay their debts and to tailor our debt collection strategies to collect final payments from customers as efficiently as possible. The process is tailored to account for specific circumstances and behaviors and also to minimize the impact on the customer relationship. Typically, customers are sent a letter stating that w e have been instructed to collect the claim on the client's behalf. If the customer does not pay w ithin a prescribed period, w e employ tailor-made strategies aimed at successful collection. Collection methods include telephone calls, letters, text messages, emails and, to some extent, personal visits by agents. Via our online tools for clients, including IntrumWeb, w e provide visibility for our clients on the amount a client's organization is ow ed and the payment status in real-time. We also provide online tools to customers that allow customers to update their contact information, review their outstanding payments and proceed w ith payments independently w ithout needing to interact w ith a customer service representative. Much of our debt collection process is standardized and automated, w ith the goal of maximizing the total amount collected over the life of the debt through sustainable payment plans or affordable settlements achieved through an amicable and solution-oriented collection approach, rather than exploiting short-term collection potential. We have integrated several automated processes into our debt collection process to improve efficiency and reduce the need for manual case handling. These processes include: - Standardized w ork processes: a sequence of predefined actions to occur according to a set schedule. Standardized processes determine w hen our agents should telephone, send a letter, text message or use another means to contact the customer. - Campaigns: the implementation of common processes for a group of claims. Campaigns typically begin w hen w e expect customers to have an enhanced ability to pay. - Event engines: softw are driven processes that prescribe a series of actions to be taken in connection w ith external events, such as customer bankruptcy, death or address modification. For example, these actions could include periodic telephone calls, text messages and other methods typically utilized in the pre-legal collection process. - Automation: the automation of business processes through the use of advanced softw are, allow ing us to carry out processes significantly faster and more efficiently than w hen done manually, including selecting w hich customers to contact based on certain criteria and gathering information and business intelligence across channels. We have the ability to provide international collection services to companies engaging in international trade in approximately 180 countries. Depending on the location of the customer, these services are delivered through our netw ork of offices or selected partners. Our partners are selected through a structured on-boarding process and termination plan and are continuously monitored to ensure they meet our code of conduct. If, after the customer has received assistance from us and an opportunity to pay, an amicable collection process is unsuccessful, the matter may be forw arded to legal authorities for a decision.

Invoices are distributed automatically and, in circumstances w here customers do not pay their bills, w e offer reminder services. Using our IT capabilities and Scoring, w e are able to send individually-adapted reminders to those w ho have fallen behind on their payments. Our database of customer payment patterns and trends enables us to adapt the design and frequency of payment reminders to customers' finances and thereby to help maintain strong client-customer relationships. If a client w ishes to send its ow n invoices, w e also offer a tailored account ledger service to support clients in completing transactions w ith their customers. _Credit information and optimization services_ We provide credit information on individuals and companies across Europe to help our clients determine who to sell to and on w hat terms. As business is increasingly conducted online, a higher proportion of goods and services are paid for through credit solutions such as invoicing or different installment models. Our integrated services help our clients prevent late or non-payment. We share our insight into existing and prospective consumers' payment patterns so that clients can make credit decisions about the creditw orthiness of their customers on the basis of efficient and reliable information to help ensure a successful transaction for w hich consumers have the capacity to pay. Our credit risk analysis is based on Scoring, w hich requires advanced statistical tools and considerable IT capacity. The overall credit risk assessment is derived from a combination of Scoring and an understanding of 111 ----- human behavior, payment patterns and the market. We therefore benefit from our long-term experience w ith European credit markets and our database of payment patterns in different markets. We also offer a monitoring service pursuant to w hich w e monitor the performance of a client's credit agreements and detect and alert the client of changes that could affect their credit risk and that may need action. This service helps clients avoid the possibility of non-payment in the future.",N/A,as_expected,2022,428

151_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,212,BUSINESS,212.5,Operations and value proposition,212.5.3,Portfolio Investments segment,"Through our Portfolio Investments segment w e purchase portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables and also offer a range of financial services to our clients. The revenue generated from returns on purchased portfolios is the primary source of revenue for this segment. For the year ended December 31, 2021, revenue from Portfolios Investments accounted for 45.3% of our total revenue w ithout giving effect to inter-company relations. Our Portfolio Investments business line predominantly invests in overdue receivables and from time to time also purchases REOs either (i) in the course of its recovery activities for secured loans (or, infrequently, in relation to unsecured loans w ith personal guarantees) or (ii) as a standalone investment strategy in w hich we, directly or indirectly and independently or alongside co-investors, hold title to real estate (REOs) that are expected to eventually be resold. We arrange for the sale of REOs using internal and external resources and netw orks. Our REO exposure is concentrated in Spain and Hungary and totals a current book value of SEK 296 million (excluding contribution by our joint ventures). _Purchase of overdue receivables_ Follow ing a thorough risk analysis assessment, w e acquire portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables for a portion of their nominal value, w ith the percentage depending on the quality of the debt. Subject to certain exceptions, w e service purchased portfolio debt independently using our in-house debt collection function, thereby benefiting from our expertise and economies of scale. We maintain pricing discipline through an institutionalized investment process and a structurally embedded risk management culture and further supported by our data analytics capabilities, w hich enable us to maintain high portfolio returns and mitigate the risk of overbidding on portfolios. We buy w ritten-off debt from nearly every type and size of company, including credit institutions, private and public enterprises and government bodies, though w e focus on acquiring portfolios from know n clients. Our provision of CMS, and the complementarity betw een collection services and debt purchasing, places us in a strong position w hen seeking to purchase portfolios. In addition to benefiting from advantages related to scale, particularly in relation to data analytics and operational efficiencies, w e have a greater understanding of the portfolios being acquired in circumstances w here w e previously serviced the relevant debt and can therefore assess and price offered portfolios more accurately. We believe our complete value proposition and established relationships make us an attractive bidder for debt portfolios. For the year ended December 31, 2021, 53% of investment in our Portfolio Investments segment w ere from existing or previous clients. Our core focus has been on portfolios containing consumer unsecured debt and w e seek to maintain portfolios that are diversified by country and industry in order to limit overall volatility. We believe that the provision of debt collection services improves our ability to participate in tenders and make sound investment decisions w ith respect to portfolios of SME receivables. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, w e invested SEK 1,185 million and SEK 1,474 million, respectively, in forw ard flow agreements and for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 w e invested SEK 709 million and SEK 949 million, respectively, in forw ard flow arrangements. We believe that forw ard flow agreements are beneficial as they provide certainty of a minimum volume of claims on w hich to perform debt collection. Similarly, these agreements are beneficial to the seller as they provide a level of predictability of the volume of claims being sold. _Origination_ The majority of portfolios for sale are currently offered to the market through competitive tender processes, although w e also engage our clients in discussions to purchase portfolios through bilateral negotiations w henever 112 ----- opportunities arise. A key driver of our success in debt purchasing has been our ability to leverage our relationships w ith clients for w hom w e collect debt through outsourcing contracts. Our local sales teams maintain close relationships w ith key debt originators in countries w here w e have local operations. In addition, our senior management maintains close relationships on a cross-border level w ith our major debt originators and are actively involved in our largest transactions w ith our major debt originators. Through these relationships, w e often receive requests for proposals in relation to the portfolios for sale. _Valuation and due diligence_ We engage in an extensive valuation of any given portfolio in order to determine w hat price w e should offer our client. First, w e look at certain characteristics, including the age of the claims in the portfolio, the size of the portfolio, the type of receivable the portfolio contains, the characteristics of collaterals (w here applicable) and their connection to the claims and the collection process already undertaken in order to determine w hether the portfolio is suitable. Once w e have determined that a portfolio is suitable, w e engage in an extensive valuation process. Our use of multiple valuation methods takes into account, among other factors, the below analyses: - for the most granular portfolios w e conduct (i) vintage analysis, w here w e use historical cash flow information to forecast future returns, (ii) debt profiles, w here w e identify and segment portfolios based on the key value drivers in the portfolio and evaluate the total likely recovery for each claim; (iii) scorecards, w here w e use internal, external and client data to evaluate the likelihood of each customer to pay and to w hat amount; and (iv) paying books, w here w e identify different payment profiles and segment accounts based on historic behavior; - for secured loan portfolios or w here claims are concentrated in an industry or particular asset class we commission collateral valuations, legal case review s including court or bankruptcy documentation, servicing notes review including, for example, past or ongoing payment or settlement agreements w ith debtors and personal guarantor asset or income investigations w hich either (a) can be reviewed position-by-position by an underw riter and w ill result in a manual underw riting business plan specific to the position or (b) be captured in a position-by-position model w hich w ill augment or correct the seller-provided data w ith, for example, specific collateral values, liens, legal status, etc. and w ill calculate position-by-position business plans. Where it is not feasible or reasonable to commission review s and valuations covering the entirety of a portfolio, w e w ill typically select a composition of the most valuable positions together w ith a random sample; the results of these review s and valuations, augmented w ith the results of the aforementioned exercises, w ill be fed into extrapolation models that w ill help adjust inputs and assumptions for the positions that could not be review ed. As a final validation step, the investment and operations team organize sessions during w hich the business plan for a selection of positions is review ed against their inputs. The emphasis w e place on each valuation method depends on the specific circumstances, information available and characteristics of the portfolio for sale. In conjunction w ith the valuation process, w e also perform due diligence on the portfolio prior to making a final bid. The purpose of this due diligence process is to identify any areas of risk that w ould impact our ability to successfully manage the portfolio follow ing its purchase. As part of the due diligence process, w e request and w ork to verify certain data fields, including claim balances, payment history on claims, details of credit agreements and legal enforceability. Additionally, w e undertake a detailed review of the assumptions underlying the valuation process and determine w hether the assumptions should be adjusted. For certain transactions, w e also engage external advisors for this process. We seek to leverage our relationships w ith clients to assist us w ith this process by obtaining guidance on pricing, w here possible. We believe that w e have a competitive advantage w hen w e are invited to bid on a portfolio for w hich we already perform debt collection because w e are able to accurately assess the potential uplift that can be generated given our familiarity w ith the debt collection measures that have already been undertaken, allow ing us to accurately price the portfolio. This results in being able to confidently offer an attractive value proposition to clients, w hich makes us a strong contender for portfolios that w e find attractive. _Offer_ Depending on the size of the transaction, the assessment and final pricing of a portfolio involves input from our country-level management and operations, our debt purchasing and debt collection teams, our IT team and senior executives. This group w orks together to use the information gathered in the process to prepare the final bid, and the relevant country team uses its know ledge and expertise to provide a current and accurate reflection of the competitive environment in order to ensure that the final bid is competitive. The final bid is determined based on an analysis of various scenarios, w hich are designed to test our models at the high and low ends of prior experience, and is evaluated and approved by pre-defined levels of management based on the size of the bid. The final price that w e offer for a portfolio takes into account the return that w e require to compensate for the risk present in the 113 ----- transaction, the possibility that actual performance of the portfolio may deviate from the expected performance and the level of competition that w e face in the market. We believe that a key driver of our success in debt purchasing is due to our ability to leverage our relationships w ith clients. We use these relationships to engage in a dialogue w ith the client in order to help us putting together a competitive bid. These relationships can also be used to propose alternative structures if we believe it w ill create value for us and the client. We also frequently receive a ""first or last look opportunity"" at a portfolio due to these pre-existing relationships. _Contract and closing_ For the majority of our portfolio purchases, clients receive a one-off cash payment. How ever, w e also offer different pricing models in an effort to address specific needs or desires of our clients. One such alternative pricing model is a profit sharing ""earn-out model"" in w hich the client receives an upfront cash payment for the portfolio based on an initial forecast and then receives a percentage of any gains above the initial forecast. _Implementation_ After purchasing a portfolio, if w e do not already perform debt collection on the purchased portfolio, we must ensure that claim balances are accurately recorded, funds paid betw een the determination date and the closing date by customers are received and customers are diverted to the appropriate phase of the collection process. We also screen individual claims against various databases to determine w hether any of the claims do not meet the specified criteria and should be returned, if contractually permitted. If w e already service the purchased portfolio, the risks associated w ith the conversion process are minimized as many of these steps have already been undertaken as part of our debt collection services. _Contact and collection process_ After acquiring a portfolio, w e typically manage the portfolio in-house. Our deep know ledge of the debt collection process enables us to create customized approaches for each customer and to determine w hether we can extract additional value from a customer and uplift on a portfolio by applying different collection methods. By servicing purchased portfolios in-house, w e also provide stability and scale to the debt collection segment of our business, w hich allow s us to improve and enhance our debt collection methods.",N/A,as_expected,2022,428

We believe that our extensive data assets and analytical capabilities enable us to proactively assess portfolios.

The latest European Payment Report, published in June 2021, indicated that despite government support having prevented businesses from failing, half of the surveyed companies acknow ledged that they w ere fortunate to have survived the pandemic. How ever, European companies have not only survived due to government support and technology development. The report show s that businesses adopted a more proactive approach to how they mitigate liquidity squeezes and the risk of late payments.

This focal point contributes to Agenda 2030 Goal 8 ""Decent work and economic growth"" including Target 8.10 ""Universal access to banking, insurance and financial services_ "" and Target 8.3 ""Promote policies to support job creation and growing enterprises"" Our areas of focus for this focal point include: - _Ethical collection by treating customers fairly: Treating our customers w ith empathy and respect for their individual circumstances is paramount to our business. This focus guides both how w e communicate w ith customers, but also how w e handle cases. This principal facilitates our clients' ability to entrust us w ith their customers, w hich w e believe to be their most important assets. Our target is to maintain the high level of value index above 80/100 and the outcome of 2021 w as 85/100. - _Responsible selection of clients and portfolios: It is important for our Company to collaborate w ith clients w ho share our values of good business ethics. We therefore select our clients and portfolios w ith care. In practice, this means that w e make a policy of opting out of clients or portfolios w hose invoices have no legal basis, that apply unethical lending terms or offensive sales methods, or are not considered ethical for other reasons. - _Sound economy for our clients: At the core of our business w e help companies get paid for the goods and services they have sold by acting as agents to them or by buying portfolios from them. We offer our clients a long-term partner facilitating development and grow th. We strive to offer our clients favorable service and to provide user-friendly solutions. We believe that these activities contribute meaningful financial value to our clients. Our target is to increase the average client satisfaction score across the group above 75/100 and the outcome of 2021 w as 77/100. - _Favourable payment terms between companies: Late payments can have negative consequences for many companies. We believe that through our various activities dedicated to indirectly shortening payment times for companies, w e contribute to these companies' development and grow th. - _Sound transactions: Money laundering is a grow ing problem in society and, as a financial sector player that handles payments, w e risk being negatively impacted. We regularly review transactions conducted w ithin our operations, and suspicious transactions are reported to the relevant authorities. - _Increased financial literacy in society: Over-indebtedness can be caused or exacerbated by a lack of know ledge about personal finances and the consequences of paying on credit. How ever, w e believe that many people w ould like to learn more about these issues at a young age. This interest represents an opportunity for us to raise the level of aw areness regarding sound finances by actively sharing our know ledge w ithin the framew ork of our daily activities and through targeted educational initiatives. We have historically conducted a number of different educational initiatives in our markets, though these have been limited during 2020 and 2021 because of COVID-19. See also ""Education"" below . 2. Being a respected and highly trusted actor._ We believe that the integration of good business ethics throughout our operations and value chain is key to being a trusted and respected actor w ithin the industry. A key facet of being a trusted and respected actor, w hich is reflected in our Code of Conduct, is our commitment to conducting our business and treating all of our customers w ith respect and consideration. We have rolled out a program in w hich each of our employees w ill receive a Code of Conduct training and the program is w ell underw ay. Through our sustainability policy, in connection w ith our Code of Conduct, w e w ork to implement our sustainability strategy including our environmental and climate impact and w e further endeavor to protect the personal data of the individuals w ith w hom w e deal by handling sensitive information in a manner that guarantees their personal integrity is respected, enabling a sustainable future for coming generations. This focal point contributes to Agenda 2030 Goal 13 ""Climate action"" including Target 13.2 ""Integrate measures against climate change into policy and 117 ----- _planning."" We further endeavor to protect the personal data of the individuals w ith w hom w e deal by handling_ sensitive information in a manner that guarantees their privacy is respected. Our areas of focus for this focal point include: _Anti-corruption: In the ordinary course of business, w e are exposed to corruption risks in our 25_ markets. Our zero-tolerance corruption policy, Code of Conduct and instructions against bribery and corruption guide our employees and others representing the Company in how they should act to manage this risk. We conduct an annual assessment of corruption risks throughout our operations, including w ith regard to the follow ing categories: risks linked to clients in each sector, geographical risks, internal risks, and implementation risks. At a Group level, w e classify our corruption risks as moderate. Although, no significant risks have been identified, w e have identified a high level of risk in relation to (a) our operations in Brazil and (b) outsourced activities and external partners outside Europe due to the augmented geographical risks. Reduced environmental footprint: Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time. We believe that business and industry can play an important role in reducing the environmental and climate impact, and w e consider it our responsibility to minimize our impact w here w e have the opportunity to do so. Our impact on the environment occurs primarily through our business travel and the energy supply to our offices. In 2018, w e began measuring the climate and environmental footprints of our operations w ithin scopes 1, 2 and 3 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. We are committed to making efforts to directly benefit the environment, such as by prioritizing video meetings over travel, ow ning a vehicle fleet consisting of cars that emit less than 130 grams of carbon dioxide in accordance w ith emissions directives from the EU and using office materials efficiently. Our total (scopes 1, 2 and 3) reported emissions (as calculated through internal measuring systems, invoices and, to a limited extent, from estimates based on average national data and comparative data from previous periods) decreased from 6,866 tonnes in the year ended December 31, 2019 to 5,510 tonnes in the year ended December 31, 2021, w hich corresponds to an approximately 20% reduction. Our target is to achieve climate neutrality by 2030 and reduce our total emissions by at least 20% (in comparison to 2019). We did a minimum disclosure to Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) in 2021 and our first full disclosure in 2022, expecting our first grade by the end of 2022. _Responsible value chains and partnerships: For us, it is important to w ork w ith companies that_ share our values of good business ethics. In addition to our clients and portfolios, w hich are the core of our supply chain, this also applies to the purchases w e make for our offices, w hen w e purchase services and, in particular, to the partner netw orks w e w ork w ith to serve our clients globally. _Data security: Given the large amount of data on customers and clients that w e handle, data_ security and data management represent one of our most important sustainability issues. We have both a legal and an ethical responsibility to handle sensitive data in a manner that guarantees respect for personal privacy, and pays due consideration to the human right of freedom from arbitrary interference w ith privacy. Incorrect use of sensitive details or loss of data, could cause great harm to the individuals affected, to our clients and to us as a Company. See ""Risk Factors— _Risks related to our industry and business—Improper disclosure of our clients' sensitive data, customer data or a breach of data protection laws whether through cyber security breaches, computer viruses or otherwise, or illegal storage or use of customer data could negatively affect our business or reputation and/or expose us to liability."" Positive relations with decision makers and organisations: Both nationally and internationally, w e_ are engaged in dialogue w ith legislators, authorities and organisations w ithin our sector. As a part of our dedication to being a good corporate citizenship w e seek to actively participate in the debates on current issues in the sector and help develop new credit management regulations. We believe that this practice helps guide the future development of our industry in a sustainable direction. 3. Growing by making a difference. We strive to be the most attractive employer in the sector by offering meaningful and stimulating w ork w ith strong opportunities to develop, grow and make a difference in the communities in w hich our employees w ork. It is important to us that all of our employees are treated respectfully and are afforded equal opportunities for development. With a presence in 25 markets, w e believe that diversity is an important asset of our Company and that through increased diversity w e can be more responsive to efforts to help people get out of debt and understand individual situations. This focal point contributes to Agenda 2030 Goal 5 ""Gender equality"" including Target 5.5 ""Ensure full participation in leadership and decision-making"" and Agenda 2030 Goal 8 including Target 8.8 ""Protect labour rights and promote safe working environments ."" 118 ----- Our areas of focus for this focal point include: _Attracting and retaining talent, including through a focus on employee well-being: We believe that_ our capacity to attract and retain talent is directly connected to our employees' w ell-being. To attract talented individuals and develop them w ithin our business, w e seek to foster internal mobility and w ork actively to illuminate internal career paths. We also focus on providing sufficient resources, know ledge and opportunities for employees to perform their duties. Our target is to increase the engagement index above 80/100 and the outcome of 2021 w as 81/100. _Diversity and inclusion: As a multicultural company w ith operations in 25 countries and w ith_ employees that speak 35 languages, w e believe that increased diversity makes us more competitive. As an employer, w e seek to treat all employees w ith the highest levels of respect. Our target is to reach a balanced gender representation (40/60) in all leadership positions and among all employees in our organization.",N/A,as_expected,2022,428

151_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,900,REGULATORY OVERVIEW,900.1,Regulation of the credit management industry,900.1.1,Fair debt collection practices,"Historically, each country has developed its ow n set of rules for debt collection operations. The regulations cover, among other things: the methods by w hich claims can be assigned or transferred; the w ays in w hich a customer can be contacted and a debt collected; and the types and level of fees, interests and costs that can be imposed, and w hether those fees, interests and costs can be passed to the customer or the client. With respect to non-performing loans (""NPLs"") the regulatory landscape relating to, inter alia, debt collection and credit purchases is currently undergoing an overhaul w hich is driven by initiatives at EU-level aimed at, inter alia, tackling the build-up of NPLs across the EU. On November 24, 2021 the European Parliament and the Council adopted Directive (EU) 2021/2167 on credit servicers and credit purchasers (the ""NPL Directive""). The NPL Directive applies to non-performing credit agreements that are more than 90 days due or w here the lending credit institution considers it unlikely to be repaid by the borrow er. The NPL Directive is intended to create a new EU-w ide framew ork that aims to facilitate the transfer by credit institutions of NPLs to credit purchasers and the development of a secondary market for NPLs for credit purchasers and servicers. Legal persons that perform ""credit servicing activities"" as defined in the NPL Directive w ill be required to obtain authorisation as a credit servicer w ith its national competent authority. Such authorisation w ill be passportable so that a credit servicer authorised in one member state w ill be permitted to carry out activities in other member states. How ever, the NPL Directive is exempting already supervised entities such as AIF/AIFMs and consumer credit institutions w hich is used for credit servicing and/or credit purchasing in some EU countries like Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia. Furthermore, a credit servicer carrying out activities in a host member state should be subject to restrictions and requirements established in national law of that host member state, hence w e do not expect much of harmonization yet. Member states are required to transpose the NPL Directive into national law s so that its provisions apply as of December 30, 2023. In countries w here there are currently no specific regulations covering debt collection and w here no licensing requirements apply for certain debt collection operations, there are still regulations of a more general nature w hich w e must observe w hen carrying out our debt collection operations. Such regulations include, for example, general civil and commercial rules and consumer protection law s and regulations regarding caps on collection fees and interest costs. In addition, in a number of markets in w hich w e operate, the reimbursement of costs for debt collection is limited by law . Any regulatory changes reducing the amount of such costs w e can recover may have a negative impact on our results of operations. Note that in Norw ay amendments to the Debt Collection Regulation came into effect on October 1, 2020, w hich reduced the amount of debt collection costs that can be claimed from debtors. In Finland, the supervising authority has objected to Intrum's practice of combining collection fees of several collection cases into one case w here Intrum is the creditor. The decision has become final follow ing the rejection of our appeal before the Administrative Court of Helsinki and the Supreme Court. As a result, Intrum Finland is required to change its business model w ith respect to debt surveillance and collection practices. Intrum Finland has begun to assess and discuss alternative business models for debt surveillance collection processes w ith the supervising authority. In parallel, a meeting w ith supervisory authority w as held in March 2021 and critical changes are being implemented based on their comments. In many of the countries in w hich our operations are licensed or regulated, our subsidiaries are subject to certain integrity tests w ith respect to debt collection. These integrity tests may include verifying that: the collection business is carried out in accordance w ith local rules and regulations; consumer lending operations are conducted in accordance w ith sound lending practices; the directors of the board have sufficient know ledge and experience and have not misused any debt collection permissions; and the directors meet other general suitability and reliability checks. 121 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,428
151_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,900,REGULATORY OVERVIEW,900.1,Regulation of the credit management industry,900.1.2,Statutes of limitations,"Rules regarding the length of time after w hich an unpaid debt may not be pursued by creditors and the w ays in w hich the statute of limitations can be tolled so that a debt can remain collectible also vary across jurisdictions. In a majority of the countries in w hich w e operate, it is possible to extend the statutes of limitation on historic debt claims indefinitely by using various methods, including enforcement actions, notification of the customer or otherw ise interrupting the limitation period w ith continued court proceedings. Some of the countries in w hich w e operate have in recent years changed the statutes of limitation for certain debt including by limiting the ability to extend or interrupt the limitation period, or have discussed doing so. We constantly monitor any changes in these rules in the countries in w hich w e operate, and, w here appropriate, implement local procedures to interrupt the limitations period. Any significant reduction in the statute of limitations or in the ability to toll the statute of limitations, and any failure to implement local procedures to interrupt the limitations periods, w ould negatively impact our operations. In addition, w e may decide not to pursue amicable collection procedures on time barred debt on ethical grounds. During 2020, Intrum France had a dialogue w ith the local Consumer Protection Agency on the amicable case handling of time barred claims. Since the handling entailed reputational risk, an internal decision w as taken to cease amicable actions in relation to time barred claims.",N/A,as_expected,2022,428
151_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,900,REGULATORY OVERVIEW,900.1,Regulation of the credit management industry,900.1.3,Enhanced consumer protection,"There has been a trend in recent years to afford more protection to consumers. Various law s, regulations and judicial decisions in jurisdictions in w hich w e operate have changed the w ay w e operate and some have negatively impacted our financial condition. For example, a few countries have proposed giving bailiffs the right to provide services in the pre-legal market, including the right to purchase debts and perform voluntary collections. We are currently assessing the impact of these proposals on the relevant subsidiaries and are closely involved in the legislative processes. Consumer protection law s can limit our ability to enforce debt claims. For example, in Finland, the enforcement of a consumer debt claim in the event of a default by the customer is subject to restrictions, such as a minimum period of time having passed as the payment due date and a minimum proportion of the debt remaining outstanding. Further, enforcement is prohibited if the payment default of the consumer customer is due to social force majeure, such as illness or unemployment, or other circumstance beyond the customer's control, unless it w ould be perceptibly unreasonable to the creditor in the circumstances. Additionally, Spanish Law 5/2019 of 15 March regulating real estate credit agreements (""Law 5/2019""), applicable to any natural person acting as borrow er, surety or guarantor, regardless of w hether he or she is a consumer or not, set forth, among others, certain provisions on the possibility of early terminating the mortgage loans, that w ould generally imply an extension of the default periods required to enforce them in comparison w ith those foreseen under the contractual provisions in the mortgage loan agreements. In particular, article 24 of the Law 5/2019 limits the lenders' right to early termination, requiring accelerating mortgage loan agreements (i) a payment default equal to 3 per cent of the total loan amount or 12 monthly instalments if the default occurs in the first half of the term of the loan or (ii) a payment default equal to 7 per cent of the total loan amount or 15 monthly instalments if the default occurs in the second half of the term of the loan. Although mortgage loan agreements entered into before the coming into force of Law 5/2019 w ill not generally be bound by this regulation, its first transitional provision ( _Disposición Transitoria Primera) sets out that the early acceleration clauses of these mortgage loan agreements w ill be bound by article 24 of the Law 5/2019, unless the borrow er argues that the contractual terms agreed are more favourable to it. This retroactivity applicable to the early acceleration clauses, w ill how ever not apply to the mortgage loan agreements already accelerated by the time the Law 5/2019 entered into force. Similar law s exist in other jurisdictions in w hich w e operate. Certain countries in w hich w e have operations have taken steps to facilitate debt restructuring by individuals, w hereby a payment plan for all outstanding indebtedness is initiated. After making all payments pursuant the payment plan, the customer is no longer liable to pay any of the debt included in the debt reconstruction. In Sw eden, a new Debt Reconstruction Act (Sw. Skuldsaneringslag 2016:675) came into effect on November 1, 2016, under w hich eligible customers are allow ed a payment plan shorter than the normal five years. In Norw ay, a debt reconstruction may involve either a delay in payment of all or part of a debt; the creditors w aiving, in w hole or in part, their claims on interest or fees; and/or the customer no longer being liable to pay the debt after a particular period of time. Other jurisdictions have taken measures to impose moratoriums on collections procedures under certain conditions or offer other collections solutions to those in debt. In 2013, the Spanish Act for the Support of Entrepreneurs (Ley 14/2013, de 27 de septiembre, de apoyo a los emprendedores y su internacionalización) introduced an out-of-court payment arrangement proceeding (Sp. acuerdo extrajudicial de pagos) in the Spanish Insolvency Act (Ley 22/2003, de 9 de julio, Concursal) that w as derogated by Royal Legislative Decree 1/2020, of 5 May, w hich approved the Recast Spanish Insolvency Law (Real Decreto Legislativo 1/2020, de 5 de mayo, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley Concursal_ ) and w hich maintains such figures, available to natural and legal persons meeting certain requirements (such as having liabilities w hich do not exceed €5 million and having sufficient assets to meet the expenses of the out-of-court payment arrangement). A customer unable to 122 ----- meet its payment obligations may apply for this procedure and a mediator w ill be appointed. Among other things, the opening of the out-of-court payment arrangement procedures w ill stay enforcement of claims over assets of the debtor for a maximum of three months in case of legal persons and tw o months in case of natural persons not considered as entrepeneurs (empresarios), except under certain circumstances (such as the enforcement of in rem security interests), and suspend the accrual of interest during the negotiation period. Payment agreements may include the assignment of certain assets of the debtor for payment of the debt, a reduction of debt, moratoriums of up to ten years or a conversion of debt into equity or into profit participative loans w ith a term of up to ten years (although in case the debtor is a natural person not considered as an entrepeneur ( _empresario) the proposed agreement may only include moratoriums, reductions of debt and assignment of certain assets of the debtor for payment of the debt). Creditors may suggest changes to the proposed agreement, w hich is subject to a majority vote by creditors and may therefore be imposed on dissenting unsecured creditors. If the out-of-court procedure does not succeed, the mediator must immediately file for the customer's insolvency and w ill be appointed as the insolvency administrator. In the Netherlands, a so-called 'broad moratorium' came recently into force that provides for a temporary cooling off period for the customer to achieve a more stable financial situation. Customers may also become subject to insolvency proceedings w hich may result in a delay or prevention in the enforcement of the claims transferred to us, including reductions in principal or interest. Collection of unsecured claims in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency is generally limited by means of the funds available for distribution from the insolvent estate.",N/A,as_expected,2022,428

The statements w ere follow ed up w ith formal guidelines on moratoria on loan repayments and the accountment treatment of those in relation to IFRS 9 (definition of default and classification of forbearance). Already on March 13, 2020, Intrum established Group w ide Ethical Guidelines related to consumers impacted by COVID-19. The main considerations related to pause any collection activities for customers impacted by COVID-19, either by being personally impacted or by being forced to take care of family members impacted by COVID-19.

151_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,900,REGULATORY OVERVIEW,900.1,Regulation of the credit management industry,900.1.5,Consumer credit development,"Consumer credit operations have received increased regulatory attention in many of the jurisdictions in w hich w e operate. Some countries have imposed caps on interest rates or total cost of credit and further regulated consumer loans w ith small principal values. Other countries have targeted particular types of consumer credit agreements. In the Netherlands, a Supreme Court ruling in June 2014 held that telecom consumers party to an agreement in w hich a ""free"" phone is provided are protected by certain law s and regulations relating to payments by instalments and consumer credit. Another pronounced effect of this enhanced focus on consumer credit has been to increase the scope of w hich entities must hold a consumer credit license. In reaction to a recent European Court of Justice case, Verein für_ _Konsumenteninformation_ _v INKO, Inkasso GmbH,_ that held debt collection companies w ere credit intermediaries and thus not required to provide pre-contractual information to consumers, many countries took legislative action to impose a requirement on debt collection companies to register w ith the local authority or obtain a consumer credit license. Stricter regulations in general may increase the compliance burden and operating costs. A Consumer Credit Directive (CCD) review is currently underw ay and Intrum is engaged in this process. Consumer protection organisations are also engaged and they have proposed to add a new section related to debt collection in the CCD. Similar proposals w ere made during the preparation for the NPL Directive, for instance defining harassment w ith sending excessive numbers of dunning letters (collection notices sent to debtors notifying them that payments they ow e are overdue), phone or reminders w hich should be associated w ith dissuasive fines and criminal charges. Another suggestion w as raised in relation to charging fees and penalties to consumers that exceeds the costs directly related to the management of debt. In our view, the first proposal needs to be further defined in order for it to be predictable, the second proposal w ould be difficult to calculate and implement in practice. Overall, Intrum maintain that the CCD is not the right instrument to regulate debt collection as the CCD deals w ith performing credit agreement relationships w hereas debt collection starts w hen a borrow er had defaulted on his or her payment obligation and the credit agreement has turned into a mere claim. Instead, w e propose that these matters should be addressed in the next review of the NPL Directive w hich is due already in 2023. We have also proposed to develop a binding pan-European Code of Conduct on the fair treatment of borrow ers, including provisions on vulnerable borrow ers. 123 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,428

Many jurisdictions deem debt purchasing as a financial undertaking or as providing credit services, and thus require debt purchasing companies to obtain approval from a local authority in order to operate their businesses. As these regulations are not based on EU legislation, each country has developed its own requirements relating to the investment in debt portfolios. In some cases, our entity is licensed as a financial undertaking by the local financial supervisory authority for purchasing debt portfolios from financial institutions and is required to hold a type of bank or credit license for its debt purchasing operations. In some jurisdictions, purchasing performing mortgages portfolios could trigger certain requirements, such as having to obtain a credit license, comply w ith AML measures or maintain a certain level of civil liability insurance. Many countries specifically regulate the assignment of debt claims to other parties. For example, in Norw ay, loans and credits granted by financial institutions can only be assigned w ithout consent of the debtor to other financial institutions. Further, the transfer of a loan portfolio is subject to the Norw egian regulator's consent if the portfolio is of significance for any of the involved entities. Additionally, some jurisdictions make it more difficult for factoring contracts to be assigned. In most of the jurisdictions in w hich w e operate, the court w ill refer to the contract in determining w hether an assignment is allow ed, but in some the courts w ill w eigh special considerations favoring consumers in deciding w hether to allow an assignment. The NPL Directive contains provisions applicable to credit purchasers including as a main rule to appoint a credit servicer to perform credit servicing activities and to notify its competent authority of such appointment (unless the credit purchaser has obtained a credit servicing license and chooses to undertake such activities itself). Furthermore, the NPL Directive requires a credit purchaser to notify the competent authority of transfers of NPLs and the identity of the new credit purchaser as w ell as information regarding, for example, aggregate outstanding balance. In order to facilitate the purchases of NPLs, credit institutions are made subject to an obligation to provide prospective credit purchasers w ith information about the relevant NPLs prior to entering into a purchasing contract. 125 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,428

The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that w ould constitute a Change of Control. The Issuer w ill not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherw ise in compliance w ith the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not validly w ithdraw n under such Change of Control Offer. Notw ithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control, or an offer or other transaction that if consummated w ould result 182 ----- in a Change of Control has been publicly announced and, if applicable, not w ithdraw n, at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The Issuer w ill comply, to the extent applicable, w ith the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other applicable securities law s or regulations (or rules of any exchange on w hich the Notes are then listed) in connection w ith the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities law s or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict w ith provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer w ill comply w ith the applicable securities law s and regulations (or exchange rules) and w ill not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict. Under the RCF Facility Agreement and the Backstop RCF Agreement, the occurrence of a change of control w ould require the repayment of such indebtedness, and under the Existing Indentures, the occurrence of a change of control w ould require the Issuer to make an offer to holders of the Existing Notes to repurchase the Existing Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof. Future debt of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may contain similar requirements, or may prohibit the Issuer from purchasing Notes in the event of a Change of Control or provide that a Change of Control is a default. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to purchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, other debt, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of the purchase on the Issuer. The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders follow ing the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited to the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes—We may _not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the Indenture.”_ Holders may not be entitled to require the Issuer to purchase their Notes in certain circumstances involving a significant change in the composition of the Issuer’s board of directors, including in connection w ith a proxy contest. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a w hole to specified other Persons. Although there is limited case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law . Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to w hether a particular transaction w ould involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to w hether a Change of Control has occurred and w hether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be w aived or modified w ith the w ritten consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes under the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2022,428

If the IRS successfully takes a contrary position, U.S. holders w ould generally be required to treat any gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of the notes as ordinary income rather than as capital gain. Furthermore, U.S. holders w ould be required to accrue interest income on a constant yield determined at the time of issuance of the notes, w ith adjustments to such accruals w hen any contingent payments are made that differ from the payments calculated based on the assumed yield. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

The principal rule is that foreign judgments are neither recognized nor enforced in Sw eden, unless such judgments pertain to a civil or commercial matter (but not for example bankruptcy) rendered by a court of another EU Member State or member state of the Economic Free Trade Association (""EFTA""), or judgments rendered by a court of another Nordic country. The United States and Sw eden do not currently have a convention or treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of court judgments, other than arbitral aw ards, in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for payment of money rendered by a federal or state court in the United States in civil and commercial matters, w hether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities law s, w ould not be directly enforceable, either in w hole or in part, in Sw eden. In order to enforce any such judgment in Sw eden, proceedings must therefore be initiated by w ay of civil law action on the judgment debt before a court of competent jurisdiction in Sw eden, or an administrative tribunal or executive or other public authority of Sw eden. Enforcement of any such judgments in Sw eden, w ould not be recognized or enforceable in Sw eden as a matter of right w ithout a retrial on its merits (but w ill be persuasive authority as a matter of evidence before the courts of law, administrative tribunals or executive or other public authorities of Sw eden). How ever, there is Sw edish case law to indicate that such judgments: (a) that are based on contract w hich expressly exclude the jurisdiction of the courts of Sw eden; (b) that w ere rendered under observance of due process of law ; (c) against w hich there lies no further right to appeal; and (d) the recognition of w hich w ould not manifestly contravene fundamental principles of the legal order or the public policy of Sw eden, should be acknow ledged w ithout retrial on its merits. Any legal proceedings in the courts of Sw eden w ill be conducted in Sw edish and a court or enforcement authority in Sw eden may require, as a further condition for admissibility and/or enforceability the translation into Sw edish of any relevant document, and assistance from Sw edish authorities in the service of process in connection w ith foreign proceedings might require the observance of certain procedural and other regulations. Pursuant to the provisions of the 2012 Brussels Regulation, a judgment entered against a company in the courts of a Member State (as defined therein, _i.e. all EU Member States) and w hich is enforceable in such a Member State, w ill be directly enforceable in Sw eden upon the satisfaction of the formal requirements of the 2012 Brussels Regulation w ithout any declaration of enforceability being required. It should be noted, how ever, that a party may apply for refusal of recognition or refusal of enforcement, as applicable, in accordance w ith the 2012 Brussels Regulation. Such an application shall be submitted to the relevant district court (Sw . tingsrätt) in Sw eden. 258 ----- With regard to the provisions of the 2007 Lugano Convention on the Recognition of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters (the ""Lugano Convention""), a judgment entered against a company in the courts of a Contracting State (as defined in therein, _i.e. all EU Member States and member states of the EFTA other than Liechtenstein (namely Iceland, Sw itzerland and Norw ay)) and w hich is enforceable in such Contracting State, w ill be directly enforceable in Sw eden only upon the satisfaction of the follow ing requirements: (a) that a motion for enforcement has been filed w ith the relevant district court (Sw . tingsrätt) in Sw eden as provided by law and has been granted; (b) that no appeals lie against the judgment entered in the courts of such Contracting State; (c) that the courts of such Contracting State had jurisdiction; (d) that summons has been duly served on the respondent in the proceedings before the courts of such Contracting State; (e) that the judgment is not inconsistent w ith a prior judgment given betw een the same parties in the same matter; and (f) that the judgment does not contravene fundamental principles of the legal order or the public policy of Sw eden. Judgements w hich are not w ithin the scope of the 2012 Brussels Regulation or Lugano Convention w ould, w ith very limited exceptions, not be recognized or enforced in Sw eden w ithout a retrial on the merits. This w ould for example apply to judgments from United States and other non-EU/EFTA countries. As a result, as the United Kingdom has left the EU, an English court judgement entered against a company incorporated in Sw eden may not be recognized or enforceable in Sw eden (absent any replacement arrangements being put in place and disregarding that the United Kingdom during a transition period w ill continue being classified as a Member State for the purposes of the 2012 Brussels Regulation and a Contracting State for the purposes of the Lugano Convention). Sw edish courts may aw ard judgments or give aw ards in currencies other than the local currency, but the judgment debtor has the right under the law s of Sw eden to pay the judgment debt (even though denominated in a foreign currency) in the local currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of payment (how ever, the judgment creditor may, subject to availability of the foreign currency, convert such local currency into the foreign currency after payment and remove such foreign currency from Sw eden), and a choice of currency provisions by the parties to an agreement may not be upheld by Sw edish courts to constitute a right to refuse payment in Sw edish kronor. 259 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,428

However, in revenue terms this underlying growth has been mostly offset by lower inflows of higher value, higher commission financial services claims relative to pre-pandemic volumes. We expect to see increased inflows of financial services claims largely into 2023 based on the current challenging macroeconomic environment and associated increases in consumer credit in general and Stage-2 loans in particular.

Adjusted segment earnings increased 78 per cent to SEK 483 M compared to Q3 2021 after adjustments to remove items affecting comparability of SEK 460 M mainly related to an impairment loss on customer relationships as a direct consequence of lowered collection expectations on Italian secured portfolios invested via joint venture arrangements, for more information see page 20.

report has been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting for the Group and in accordance with Chapter 9 of the Annual Accounts Act for the Parent Company. In addition to appearing in the financial statements, disclosures in accordance with IAS 34 also appear in other parts of the interim report. The accounting principles applied by the Group and the Parent Company are essentially unchanged compared with the 2021 Annual Report. Parent Company The Group’s publicly listed Parent Company, Intrum AB (publ), owns the subsidiaries, provides the Group’s head office functions and handles certain Group-wide development work, services and marketing. The Parent Company reported revenues of SEK 534 M (454) for the third quarter and earnings before tax of SEK -1,593 M (-270). The Parent Company invested SEK 42 M (30) in fixed assets for the quarter and at the end of the quarter held SEK 439 M (505) in cash and cash equivalents. The average number of employees was 77 (60). Development in the period Total assets in the first nine months of the year increased by SEK 2,872 M to SEK 91,755 M at the end of September 2022 from SEK 88,883 M at the end of 2021. The increase was mainly due to the additional investments in Portfolio Investments of SEK 3,683 M (see also Portfolio Investment section within this report for further details) partially offset by negative adjustments mainly caused by lowered collection expectations on specific portfolios invested via joint venture arrangements, principally the Italian SPVs as identified as part of the regular revaluation process. The book value of the italian joint ventures reduced by SEK 2,665 M to SEK 3,879 M, the movement was recognised in Participation in associated companies and joint ventures in the profit and loss. As a direct consequence client relationships reduced by SEK 393 M to SEK 1,053 M, the movement was recognised in cost of sales in the profit and loss. For the client relationship impairment the discount rate of 7.7% was used compared to 14.1% at initial recognition. In addition, fair value loss on derivative amounting to SEK 95 M resulted in a liability of SEK 85 M, the movement was recognised in net financial items in the profit and loss. Net FX movement was mainly due to SEK/EUR exposure which changed by a positive SEK 1,599 M the first nine months of 2022. Working capital was SEK -1,278 M at the end of September 2022 compared to the SEK -1,244 M at the end of December 2021. The share of revenues denominated in EUR amounted to 71 per cent (60). Transactions with related parties During the quarter no significant transactions occurred between the Group and other closely related companies, board members or the Group management team. Investments in joint ventures IAS 28 requires recognition of impairment losses relating to joint ventures if objective evidence is available to support such losses. Such assessment ordinarily includes significant management judgement and forward looking assumptions with limited observable data. Objective evidence considered can include for example continued underperformance compared to forecasts and/ or comparable transactions completed by third parties at arm’s length. Market development and outlook The Group’s integrated business model consists of credit management services and portfolio investments and benefits from favourable medium term development prospects in both areas. The Group continues to execute its Transformation program and will gradually standardise, globalise and improve its collections processes. The Group anticipates the actions being taken in this area will continue to improve efficiency and margins, as well as enabling sustainable and organic growth. Significant risks and uncertainties Risks to which the Group and Parent Company are exposed include but are not strictly limited to any and all risks relating to economic developments, compliance and changes in regulations, reputation risks, tax risks, risks attributable to IT and information management, epidemic and pandemic risks, geopolitical risks such as political risks, civil unrest, disruption, or conflicts including armed conflicts and war directly or indirectly affect ing locations where Intrum or its clients maintain or conduct business, risks attributable to acquisitions, market risks, liquidity risks, credit risks, risks inherent in and associated with portfolio investments and payment guarantees, as well as financing risks. The risks are described in more detail in the Board of Directors’ report in Intrum’s 2021 Annual and Sustainability report. High level of uncertainty with high inflation and in particular high and increasing energy prices and interest rates are a major concern for the euro-area. Intrum has a resilient business model and demand for our services and solutions are expected to increase over the coming quarters. No new significant risks have arisen besides those described in the Annual and Sustainability report. Fair value of financial instruments Most of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities (portfolio investments, accounts receivable, other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, liabilities to credit institutions, bonds, commercial paper, accounts payable and other liabilities) are carried at amortised cost in the consolidated financial statements. For most of these financial instruments, the carrying amount is deemed to be a good estimate of fair value. For outstanding bonds with a total carrying value of SEK 46,098 M (44,129) at the end of the quarter, fair value is, however, estimated at SEK 39,777 M (46,156). The Group also holds forward exchange contracts and other financial assets of SEK 280 M (78), as well as financial liabilities of SEK 75 M (78) carried at fair value through the income statement. Financing Net debt amounted to SEK 52,488 M (48,693), the share of fixed rate debt amounts to 72 per cent of net debt and is principally composed of EUR bonds with maturities between 2024 and 2027. Net debt in relation to the RTM cash EBITDA stands at 4.0x compared to 4.2x at the end of the third quarter 2021. By the end of the third quarter, Intrum had SEK 1,829 M (3,882) outstanding commercial paper, the decrease reflects a more negative short term credit sentiment. Drawings under the revolving credit facility have been used to cover for this. At the end of the quarter SEK 8,816 M (2,684) of Intrum’s revolving credit facility was utilised. Events after the balance sheet date No events after the balance sheet date. ----- ## Other information The share Intrum AB’s (publ) share is included in Nasdaq Stockholm’s Large Cap list.

The Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer are responsible for the preparation and presentation of this interim report in accordance with IAS 34 and the Annual Accounts Act. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on this interim report based on our review. Scope of Review We conducted our review in accordance with the International Standard on Review Engagements ISRE 2410 Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity. A review consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review has a different focus and is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and other generally accepted auditing practices. The procedures performed in a review do not enable us to obtain a level of assurance that would make us aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Therefore, the conclusion expressed based on a review does not give the same level of assurance as a conclusion expressed based on an audit. Conclusion Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim report is not, in all material respects, prepared for the Group in accordance with IAS 34 and the Annual Accounts Act, and for the Parent Company in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act. Stockholm 27 October 2022 Deloitte AB Patrick Honeth Authorised Public Accountant ----- ## Definitions Result concepts, key figures and alternative indicators Acquired growth Growth in cash revenues related to mergers and acquisitions of Group companies.

Cash revenues Revenues excluding non-cash revenues such as portfolio amortisation and earnings from joint ventures. Cash tax normalised Earnings tax paid adjusted for non recurring items. Cash flow from joint ventures The cash flow received by Intrum in form of distributions and dividends from investments in non-consolidated joint ventures. EBITDA EBITDA is defined as operating earnings (EBIT) adding back deprecation and amortisations of tangible and intangible assets.

External revenues Revenues from Intrum’s external clients and revenues generated from Real Estate Owned assets (REO). Internal revenues Predominantly related to revenues paid by the Portfolio Investment segment to Credit Management Services and Strategic Markets segments for collection activities made on the behalf of Intrum’s own portfolios. Items affecting comparability Significant items that impact comparability of key metrics are adjusted from IFRS reported numbers to provide more relevant information to external users. Items Affecting Comparability (“IAC”) are based on three sub-groups: Group Restructurings (“Restructurings”), Non-Recurring Items (“NRIs”) and Non-Cash Items (“NCIs”). Restructurings are costs relating to group-wide business transformation programs and M&A transactions. Incremental temporary incurred costs over and above anticipated net fixed costs are reported as an IAC. NRIs are one-off costs or income that weren’t incurred in previous reporting periods and are not expected to recur in future reporting periods. An item that is part of core operations is not reported as an NRI irrespective how infrequent it could be occurring in business operations. For cash metrics, NCIs represent all valuation, estimates and provisions which are non-cash in nature and relates to future periods. For non-cash metrics, NCIs represent items that enhances periodic comparability, like adjustments to prospective accounting changes, measurement adjustments to match revenue and costs that are interconnected or recognition of partial impairment losses that relate to the current reporting period. NCI excludes normal working capital changes. NCIs could arise from Restructurings or NRIs. Net debt Net debt is interest-bearing liabilities and pension provisions less liquid assets and interestbearing receivables. ----- Net debt/cash EBITDA This key figure refers to net debt divided by Cash EBITDA on a rolling 12-month basis. The key figure is included among the Group’s financial targets, it is an important measure for assessing the level of the Group’s borrowings and is a widely accepted measure of financial capacity among lenders. This key figure is calculated in accordance with the definitions stated in the terms of the Group’s revolving syndicated loan facility, which means, among other things, that participations in non-consolidated joint ventures is only included to the extent that earnings are distributed to Intrum and that operations acquired during the period are included on a pro forma-basis throughout the 12-month period. Operating earnings (EBIT) Operating earnings consist of revenues less operating expenses as shown in the income statement. Operating margin The operating margin consists of operating earnings expressed as a percentage of revenues. Operating margin, segment The operating margin, segment consists of service line earnings expressed as a percentage of revenues.

Organic growth is a measure of the development of the Group’s existing operations that management has the ability to influence. Other capex Investments made to maintain and grow the business. For example, IT and tangible assets. Portfolio investments – collected amounts, amortisations and revaluations Portfolio investments consist of portfolios of delinquent consumer debts purchased at prices below the nominal receivable. These are recognised at amortised cost applying the effective interest method, based on a collection forecast established at the acquisition date of each portfolio. Revenues attributable to portfolio investments consist of collected amounts less amortisation for the period and revaluations. The amortisation represents the period’s reduction in the portfolio’s current value, which is attributable to collection taking place as planned. Revaluation is the period’s increase or decrease in the current value of the portfolios attributable to the period’s changes in forecasts of future collection. Total portfolio investments made The investments for the period in portfolios of overdue receivables, with and without collateral, investments in real estate and in joint ventures whose operations entail investing in portfolios of receivables and properties. Replenishment capex The estimated portfolio investments required to maintain the ERC in a steady state. Calculated by dividing the in quarter gross cash collections by the RTM MoM multiple. REO Real estate owned. Return on Portfolio Investments (ROI) Return on portfolio investments is the service line earnings for the period, excluding operations in factoring and payment guarantees (financial services), recalculated on a full-year basis, as a percentage of the average carrying amount of the balance-sheet item purchased debt. The ratio sets the segment’s earnings in relation to the amount of capital tied up and is included in the Group’s financial targets. The definition of average book value is based on using average values for the quarters. Year to date and RTM is calculated using the opening and closing balances of the quarters in the period. Revenues Consolidated revenues include external servicing earnings (variable collection commissions, fixed collection fees, debtor fees, guarantee commissions, subscription earnings, etc.), earnings from portfolio investments operations (collected amounts less amortisation and revaluations for the period) and other earnings from financial services (fees and net interest from financing services).

The Company is listed as a large company on Nasdaq Stockholm, a stock exchange located in Sweden. The Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, “the Group”) main operation is to provide payment solutions, credit and collection services to clients. The Group mainly operates predominantly in the European market. The fi nancial statements are presented in Swedish Kroner (“SEK”) and rounded to the nearest million. Accounting Framework The Groups’ consolidated fi nancial statements are prepared in compliance with: - the Swedish Annual Accounts Act – Årsredovisningslag (1995:1554); - the EU-adopted IFRSs, including interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretation Committee (“IFRIC”); and - RFR 1 Supplementary Accounting Rules for Groups issued by the Swedish Financial Reporting Board (“SFRB”). The Company’s standalone fi nancial statements are prepared using the same accounting framework as the Group’s consolidated fi nancial statements. In addition, the Company’s fi nancial statements comply with RFR 2 Accounting for Legal Entities issued by the SFRB. RFR 2 requires that the standalone fi nancial statements should be prepared in accordance with the EU-adopted IFRSs within the framework of the Swedish Annual Accounts Act, taking into account the connection between reporting and taxation. The recommendation specifi es exemptions and additions relative to IFRSs’ requirements. The fi nancial statements are composed of the primary statements: Statement of Comprehensive Income (“SCI”), Statement of Financial Position (“SFP”), Statement of Changes in Equity (“SCE”), Statement of Cash Flows (“SCF”) and accompanying notes (“the Notes”) to the primary statements. The SCI is composed of Profi t and Loss (“P&L”) and Other Comprehensive Income (“OCI”). The P&L is prepared based on the ‘income statement classifi ed by function’ method. The SCF is prepared based on the indirect method. Going-concern Assumption The fi nancial statements are prepared based on a going-concern assumption. Management has assessed the potential future cash generation of the Group, its liquidity, existing funding available and other actions which may be taken to further improve cash management and has concluded that there are no fi nancial or other indicators that may cast signifi cant doubt upon the Group’s ability to meet its obligations in the foreseeable future and in particular in the next 12 months. Note 2 Accounting Policies Standards, Interpretations, Rules and Other Changes Adopted During 2021 _IFRIC Interpretation: Attributing Benefi t to Periods of Service (April 2021)_ In April 2021, IFRIC issued an interpretation on IAS 19 Employee Benefi ts that requires an entity to attribute benefi ts to periods of service. The period of service starts when an entity has an obligation towards the employee until the service period when additional service does not impact timing or amount of the fi nal benefi t. The Group prospectively adopted this interpretation with eff ect from 1 January 2021. This impacted the Greek subsidiary, where employees are entitled to a lumpsum payment based on their fi nal salary (benefi t formula), provided these employees were in continuous employment for 16 years. Previously, the benefi t was attributable to the full service period and the pension obligation covered all employees. As a result of the interpretation, the pension obligation and service costs will now only be computed for employees who are at least 46 years old and will complete 16 years of continuous service. This resulted in a reduction of pension obligation from SEK 110 M to SEK 41 M and reduction of service costs of SEK 38 M. Consequently, the retained earnings increased from by SEK 38 M and OCI increased by SEK 30 M, respectively. _Other Changes_ During 2021, the exchange rate diff erences which were previously included as ‘Reduction of interest paid’ are now included in ‘Borrowing and repayment of loans’. The comparative information in 2020 has been restated to refl ect this change in 2021 fi nancial statements. During 2021, the amortisation method for the client servicing Assets was changed from straight-line to diminishing balance method. The diminishing balance method more accurately depicts the underlying cashfl ows. Standards, Interpretations, Rules and Other Changes Eff ective in 2022 Onwards _Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement (January & July 2020)_ The IASB issued an amendment which clarifi es and requires that a liability that cannot be deferred for settlement for at least 12 months from the reporting date should be classifi ed as current liabilities. Likewise, if a liability is due within 12 months but an entity has a legal right, as at the reporting date, to extend or roll it for at least 12 months then such liabilities would be disclosed as non-current liabilities. The amendment is eff ective from 1 January 2023 with an option for early adoption. The amendment confi rms the Group’s existing interpretation of the standard. Therefore, the application of the amendment will not have any impact on the Group’s fi nancial statements. _Annual Improvements to IFRS 2018 – 2020 (January & July 2020)_ As part of annual improvements, the IASB issued following updates: - Amendment to IFRS 1 – a subsidiary may elect in its financial statements the carrying amount that would be included in the parent’s consolidated fi nancial statements, based on the parent’s date of transition to IFRSs, if no adjustments were made for consolidation procedures and for the eff ects of the business combinations in which the parent acquired the subsidiary. A similar election is available to as an associate or joint venture that uses the above-mentioned exemption. - Amendment to IFRS 9 – an entity should only include fees that is paid or received between the borrower and the lender in application of the ’10 per cent’ quantitative test to fulfi l derecognition of fi nancial liabilities. - Amendment to IFRS 16 – the amendment rectifi es an illustrative example in IFRS 16 by clearly distinguishing between lease incentive and subsequent reimbursement for leasehold improvements. - Amendment to IAS 41 – an entity can use a pre-tax discount rate to discount cash fl ows when measuring fair value of a biological asset. The amendments are eff ective from 1 January 2022 with an option for early adoption. The amendments are not expected to have any signifi cant impact on the Group’s fi nancial statements. _Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement (February 2021)_ The IASB issued an amendment which requires only material accounting policies should be disclosed in fi nancial statements. Previously, IAS 1 required all signifi cant accounting policies to be disclosed in the fi nancial statements. The amendment also provide guidance to assist in applying materiality judgement. On application of this amendment, accounting policies will only be disclosed if the underlying transactions are assessed as material and vice versa. The Group will assess its accounting policies in 2022 and revise ‘accounting policies’ disclosure to comply with this amendment. The amendment is eff ective from 1 January 2023 with an option for early adoption. _Amendments to IAS 8 (February 2021)_ The IASB issued an amendment to explain the term ‘accounting estimate’ and also guidance to diff erentiate it with an ‘accounting error’. Change to accounting estimates are applied prospectively. The amendment is eff ective from 1 January 2023 with an option for early adoption. The amendment is not expected to have any signifi cant impact on the Group’s fi nancial statements. _Amendments to IAS 12 (May 2021)_ The IASB issued an amendment in reference to IFRS 16 Leases, which clarifi es that a taxable temporary diff erence should not be recognised, at the time of the transaction, if it does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary diff erences. The amendment is eff ective from 1 January 2023 with an option for early d ti ----- The amendment is not expected to have signifi cant impact on the Group’s fi nancial statements. _Amendments to IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 (December 2021)_ The IASB issued an amendment to provide guidance to entities applying IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 for the fi rst time. The amendment provides guidance relating to comparative information which needs to restated as part of fi rst-time application of IFRS 17. The amendment is eff ective from 1 January 2023 with an option for early adoption. The Group doesn’t write any insurance business and will not be impacted by IFRS 17. The fi nancial guarantees issued by the Group are recognised under IFRS 9. Signifi cant Accounting Policies Applicable to Current and Prior Year _Subsidiaries_ Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the group has control. The Group controls an entity where the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to aff ect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations by the Group. Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated statement of profi t or loss, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and balance sheet respectively. _Associates_ Associates are all entities over which the Group has signifi cant infl uence but not control or joint control. This is generally the case where the Group holds between 20 percent and 50 percent of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting (see (iv) below), after initially being recognised at cost. _Joint arrangement_ Under IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements investments in joint arrangements are classifi ed as either joint operations or joint ventures. The classifi cation depends on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor, rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement. The Group only has joint ventures which are accounted for using the equity method (see (iv) below), after initially being recognised at cost in the consolidated balance sheet. _Equity method_ Under the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of in other comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from associates and joint ventures are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment. Where the Group’s share of losses in an equity-accounted investment equals or exceeds its interest in the entity, including any other unsecured long-term receivables, the group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the other entity. Unrealised gains on transactions between the group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the group’s interest in these entities. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of equity-accounted investees have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. The carrying amount of equity-accounted investments is tested for impairment if indicators exists that carrying value of the investments may not be recovered. _Changes in ownership interests_ The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in a loss of control as ‘transactions with equity owners in their capacity as owners’ of the group. A change in ownership interest results in an adjustment between the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests to refl ect their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount of the adjustment to non-controlling interests and any consideration paid or received is recognised in a separate reserve within equity attributable to owners of the Company. When the Group ceases to consolidate or equity account for an investment because of a loss of control, joint control or signifi cant infl uence, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profi t or loss. This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or fi nancial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassifi ed to profi t or loss. If the ownership interest in a joint venture or an associate is reduced but joint control or signifi cant infl uence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassifi ed to profi t or loss where appropriate. Foreign currency transactions The Group applies IAS 21 Eff ects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. _Functional and presentation currency_ Items included in the fi nancial statements of each of the group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated fi nancial statements are presented in millions of SEK, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency. _Transactions and balances_ Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign curi d h ll i d i fi l qualifying net investment hedges or are attributable to part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. _Translation of the fi nancial statements of foreign operations_ The results and fi nancial position of foreign operations (none of which has the currency of a hyperinfl ationary economy) that have a functional currency diff erent from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: - Assets and liabilities in foreign operations, including goodwilland fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are translated at the closing rate at the balance sheet date. - Income and expenses are translated at the average rates, which is deemed a reasonable approximation of the rates prevailing at the transaction dates. - All resulting exchange diff erences are recognised directly in total comprehensive income. On consolidation, exchange diff erences arising from the translation of any net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other fi nancial instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised in other comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is sold or any borrowings forming part of the net investment are repaid, the associated exchange diff erences are reclassifi ed to profi t or loss, as part of the gain or loss on sale. Business Combinations The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations, regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary comprises the: - fair values of the assets transferred - liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business - equity interests issued by the Group - fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, and - fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary. Identifi able assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquired entity’s net identifi able assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. The excess of the: - consideration transferred, - amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity, and - acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as good ----- impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at the end of each reporting period. Portfolio investments Portfolio investments consist of portfolios of delinquent receivables purchased at prices signifi cantly below the nominal receivable. In accordance with IFRS 9 they are classifi ed as “purchased or originated credit- impaired” (POCI). Portfolio investments usually refer to receivables from private individuals and companies and are either secured and unsecured receivables. They are initially recognised at cost and subsequently measured at amortised cost. The eff ective interest rate of a purchased credit-impaired loan would be the discount rate that equates the present value of the expected cash fl ows with the purchase price of the loan. Expected cash fl ows are gross and include the loan amount, reminder fees, collection fees and late interest that, based on a probability assessment, are expected to be received from end customers. The initial lifetime expected credit losses (ECL) are included in the estimated cash fl ows when calculating the credit-adjusted eff ective interest rate. Cash fl ow projections are monitored over the course of the year and updated based on, among other things, achieved collection results, agreements reached with end-customers on instalment plans and macroeconomic information, including forecasts of economic development and unemployment in each country. Cash fl ow projections are made at the portfolio level assuming each portfolio to be relatively homogeneous and comprising a large number of receivables for smaller amounts. In case of portfolios comprising individual larger receivables the projections are made at the receivables level. Any subsequent changes in lifetime ECL, both positive and negative, will be recognised immediately in the income statement, even if the lifetime ECL are less than the amount of ECL that were included in the estimated cash fl ows on initial recognition. . In the consolidated income statement, income from portfolio investments is recognised, in accordance with the eff ective interest rate method, as the collected amount less amortisation. In case of sale of portfolios of purchased debt, sale proceeds are reported as revenue. And the net book value of the portfolios is carried at amortised cost. Financial assets _Classifi cation_ The Group classifi es its fi nancial assets in the following measurement categories: - those to be measured subsequently at fair value through profi t or loss, and - those to be measured at amortised cost. The classifi cation depends on the Group’s business model for managing the fi nancial assets and the contractual terms of the cash fl ows. For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profi t or loss. _Recognition and derecognition_ Regular way purchases and sales of fi nancial assets are recognised on settlement which is the date when the company becomes a party to the instrument’s contractual provisions. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash fl ows from the fi nancial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. of the business acquired, the diff erence is recognised directly in profi t or loss as a bargain purchase. Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present value as at the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the Group’s incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an independent fi nancier under comparable terms and conditions. Contingent consideration is classifi ed either as equity or a fi nancial liability. Amounts classifi ed as a fi nancial liability are subsequently remeasured to fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in profi t or loss. If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date. Any gains or losses arising from such remeasurement are recognised in profi t or loss. Intangible fi xed assets _Goodwill_ Goodwill is measured as described above. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill is not amortised but it is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired, and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefi t from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. The units or groups of units are identifi ed at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, being the operating segments _Capitalised software_ Expenditures associated with maintaining software programs are expensed as incurred. Development costs attributable to the design and testing of software products under the Group’s control and with anticipated future economic benefi ts are capitalised if the following criteria are met: - it is technically feasible to complete the software so that it will be available for use - management intends to complete the software and use or sell it - there is an ability to use or sell the software - it can be demonstrated how the software will generate probable future economic benefi ts - adequate technical, fi nancial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell - the software are available, and - the expenditure attributable to the software during its development can be reliably measured. Directly attributable costs include staff costs and appropriate portion of overheads. Borrowing costs are included in the cost of qualifi ed fi xed assets. Additional expenditures for previously developed software, etc. are recognised as an asset if they increase the future economic benefi ts of the specifi c asset to which they are attributable, e.g., by improving or extending a computer program’s functionality beyond its original use and estimated useful life tised using the straight-line method over their useful lives (3–5 years). Useful life is reassessed annually. The asset is recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. _Client servicing assets_ Client servicing assets represent the legal rights to servicing of non-performing portfolio. These assets are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. These assets are recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. These assets are amortised at diminishing balance method ranging from 10 percent to 20 percent. _Client relationships_ Separately acquired client relationships and licenses are shown at historical cost. Client relationship, licenses and customer contracts acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. They have a fi nite useful life and are subsequently carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. _Other intangible fi xed assets_ Other intangible fi xed assets relate to other acquired rights are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life (3–5 years). Useful life is reassessed annually. The asset is recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Tangible fi xed assets Tangible fi xed assets are recognised at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the item. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefi ts associated with the item will fl ow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognised when replaced. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profi t or loss during the reporting period in which they are incurred. Depreciation is booked on a straight-line basis over the asset’s anticipated useful life (3–5 years). Useful life is reassessed annually. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are included in profi t or loss. Impairment Goodwill that has an indefi nite useful life is not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. Other assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifi able cash infl ows which are largely inde ----- _Measurement_ At initial recognition, the Group measures a fi nancial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a fi nancial asset not at fair value through profi t or loss (FVPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the fi nancial asset. Transaction costs of fi nancial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profi t or loss. Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group’s business model for managing the asset and the cash fl ow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which the Group could classifi es its debt instruments: _• Amortised cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash_ fl ows, where those cash fl ows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these fi nancial assets is included in fi nance income using the eff ective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in profi t or loss and presented in other gains/(losses) together with foreign exchange gains and losses. Impairment losses are presented as separate line item in the statement of profi t or loss. _• FVPL: Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost are mea-_ sured at FVPL. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVPL is recognised in profi t or loss and presented net within other gains/(losses) in the period in which it arises. _Impairment_ The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried at amortised cost. For trade receivables, the Group applies the simplifi ed approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables. The carrying value of accounts receivable should refl ect the contractually agreed future cash-fl ows from the receivables, less a provision lifetime expected credit losses, in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. The company assess at each balance sheet date the need to provide for credit losses based on circumstances such as the receivable becoming signifi cantly overdue or the client being in signifi cant fi nancial diffi culty. The loss provision is based on historical data and adjusted for macroeconomic outlook. The impact of changes in the forward looking parameters are then adjusted in subsequent reporting periods. For Portfolio receivable the initial lifetime expected credit losses (ECL) are included in the estimated cash fl ows when calculating the credit-adjusted eff ective interest rate. _Derivatives_ Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into, and they are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The accounting for subsequent changes in fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as either: - hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a fi rm commitment (fair value hedges) - hedges of a particular risk associated with the cash fl ows of recognised assets and liabilities and highly probable forecast transactions (cash fl ow hedges), or - hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedges). At inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, including whether changes in the cash fl ows of the hedging instruments are expected to off set changes in the cash fl ows of hedged items. The Group documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking its hedge transactions. The fair values of derivative fi nancial instruments designated in hedge relationships are disclosed in note 34. The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classifi ed as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months; it is classifi ed as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. The eff ective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash fl ow hedges is recognised in the cash fl ow hedge reserve within equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineff ective portion is recognised immediately in profi t or loss, within other gains/(losses). When forward contracts are used to hedge forecast transactions, the Group generally designates only the change in fair value of the forward contract related to the spot component as the hedging instrument. Gains or losses relating to the eff ective portion of the change in the spot component of the forward contracts are recognised in the cash fl ow hedge reserve within equity. The change in the forward element of the contract that relates to the hedged item (‘aligned forward element’) is recognised within OCI in the costs of hedging reserve within equity. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassifi ed in the periods when the hedged item aff ects profi t or loss. Investments in foreign subsidiaries (net assets including goodwill) are to some extent hedged through loans in foreign currency or forward exchange contracts. Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash fl ow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the eff ective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in reserves in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineff ective portion is recognised immediately in profi t or loss within other gains/(losses). Gains and losses accumulated in equity are reclassifi ed to profi t or loss when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold. Accounts receivable Accounts receivable are recognised at their fair value which is the amount of the consideration that is unconditional, unless they contain signifi cant fi nancing components. The Group holds them with the objective of collecting the contractual cash fl ows and therefore measures them at amortised cost using the eff ective interest method. The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplifi ed approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivable. The expected loss rates are based on the payment profi les of sales over a period of 36 months before 31 December 2021 or 1 January 2021 respectively and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to refl ect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors aff ecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables. The group has identifi ed the GDP and the unemployment rate of the countries in which it sells its goods and services to be the most relevant factors, and accordingly adjusts the historical loss rates based on expected changes in these factors. P t h ldi tion with the recovery of collateral for acquired receivables, the Group may become owners of property holdings or other physical goods. They have been acquired for the purpose of being divested within the Group’s ongoing operations, and are therefore classifi ed as inventories. These are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs costs necessary to make the sale. Legal outlays The Group incurs outlays for court fees, legal representation, enforcement authorities, etc., which can be charged to and collected from end-debtors. In certain cases Intrum has agreements with its clients where any expenses that cannot be collected from debtors are instead refunded by the clients. The amount that is expected to be recovered from a solvent counterparty is recognised as an asset in the balance sheet on the line Other receivables. The legal outlays are recognised at their fair value which is the amount of that can be claimed, unless they contain signifi cant fi nancing components. Legal outlays are subsequently measures at amortised cost using the eff ective interest method. Client funds Client funds, which are reported as assets and liabilities in the balance sheet, represent cash received on collection of a specifi c debt on behalf of a client and payable to the client within a specifi ed period. Cash and cash equivalents For the purpose of presentation in the statement of cash fl ows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, deposits held at call with fi nancial institutions other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignifi cant risk of changes in value, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities in the balance sheet. Accounts payable These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the fi nancial year which are unpaid. Trade and other payables are presented as current liabilities unless payment is not due within 12 months after the reporting period. They are recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the eff ective interest method. Bond loan and liabilities to credit institutions Bond loans and liability to fi nancial institutions (the “Borrowings”) are initially recognised at fair value. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Any diff erence between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognised in profi t or loss over the period of the Borrowings using the eff ective interest method. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates. Borrowings are removed ----- Leasing Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. The Group applies the two recognition and measurement exceptions in IFRS16 on short-term leases, of 12 months or less, and low leases of low value assets, those with a vaue of USD 5K or less when new, and recognises the lease payments on a straight-line basis over the lease period. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments: - fi xed payments (including in-substance fi xed payments), less any lease incentives receivable - variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index - or rate as at the commencement date - amounts expected to be payable by the group under residual value guarantees - he exercise price of a purchase option if the group is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and - payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term refl ects the group exercising that option. - Lease payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options are also included in the Lease payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options are also included in the measurement of the liability. Lease payments are allocated between principal and fi nance cost. The fi nance cost is charged to profi t or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following: - the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability - any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received - any initial direct costs, and - restoration costs. Taxes Income taxes expense or credit for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income, based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction, adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary diff erences and to unused tax losses . The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period in the countries where the company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation and considers whether it is probable that a taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment. The group measures its tax balances either based on the most likely amount or the expected value, depending on which method provides a better prediction of the resolution of the uncertainty. Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary diff erences arising between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax base However deferred taxes are not accounted for if they and liabilities in a transaction other than a business combination which, at the time of the transaction, does not aff ect either the accounting or taxable profi t or loss and does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary diff erences. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are not recognised for temporary diff erences between the carrying amount and tax bases of investments in foreign operations where the company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary diff erences and it is probable that the diff erences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax is determined by applying the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets from deductible temporary diff erences and tax-loss carryforwards are only recognised if it is probable that future taxable income will be available to utilise those temporary diff erences and losses. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are off set where there is a legally enforceable right to off set current tax assets and liabilities and where the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are off set where the entity has a legally enforceable right to off set and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Current and deferred taxes are recognised in the stand alone and consolidated income statements unless they relate to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case the taxes are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outfl ow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and an amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future losses. Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period. The discount rate used to determine the present value is a pre-tax rate that refl ects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specifi c to the liability. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as interest expense. Employee benefi ts _Short-term benefi ts_ Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefi ts, annual leave and accumulating sick leave that are expected to be settled wholly within 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service are recognised in respect of employees’ services up to the end of the reporting period and are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. The liabilities are presented as current other liabilities in the balance sheet. _Long term obligation_ The Group granted certain employees long term benefi ts that vests over a three year period . Eligible employees may be granted up to certain percentage of their annual base salary if certain performance conditions are met at the end of the vesting period. The liabilities are presented as non-current liabiliti i th b l h t Th bli ti th f d th value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period. _Post-employment benefi ts_ The Group operates various post-employment schemes, including both defi ned benefi t and defi ned contribution pension plans. The liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defi ned benefi t pension plans is the present value of the defi ned benefi t obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defi ned benefi t obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defi ned benefi t obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outfl ows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefi ts will be paid, and that have terms approximating to the terms of the related obligation. The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defi ned benefi t obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefi t expense in the statement of profi t or loss. Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur, directly in other comprehensive income. They are included in retained earnings in the statement of changes in equity and in the balance sheet. Changes in the present value of the defi ned benefi t obligation resulting from plan amendments or curtailments are recognised immediately in profi t or loss as past service costs. For defi ned contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee benefi t expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available. _Multi-employer pension plan_ The Group participates in a multi-employer pension plans for specifi ed Swedish employees. According to the SFRB, UFR 10, the Group accounts for its participation in the plan as if it were a defi ned contribution plan as suffi cient information on its proportional share of plan assets, liabilities and costs are not available to the Group. There is no contractual agreement that states how surpluses and defi cits in the plan are to be distributed among plan participants. The premium is individually calculated, depending on salary, previously vested pension and anticipated remaining term of employment. The Group pays a regular premium amount to Alecta (Swedish insurance company) which manages these multi-employer Swedish pension plans. _Share-based payments_ Share-based compensation benefi ts are provided to employees via the Group Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), under which eligible employees may be granted up to certain percentage of their annual base salary, worth of fully paid ordinary shares in the Company for no cash consideration. The fair value of shares is recognised as an employee benefi ts expense, with a corresponding increase in equity. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares granted which: - Includes any market performance conditions (e.g. to total shareholders ----- - excludes the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions (e.g. EPS targets and remaining an employee of the entity over a specifi ed time period), and - includes the impact of any non-vesting conditions (e.g. the requirement for employees to save or hold shares for a specifi c period of time). The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specifi ed vesting conditions are to be satisfi ed. At the end of each period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting and service conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in profi t or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. The LTIP includes a net settlement feature under which the shares necessary to settle the employee’s tax obligations are withheld by the Group which transfer amount of taxes associated with a share-based payment to the tax authority on the employee’s behalf. Borrowing costs General and specifi c borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use or sale. Qualifying assets are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale. Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specifi c borrowings, pending their expenditure on qualifying assets, is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation. Other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. No interests were capitalised during 2021 or 2020. Treasury shares Where the Company purchases its own shares and holds them in treasury (‘treasury shares’): - The amount paid for the treasury shares is deducted from equity; - No gain or loss are recognised in profi t or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of an Company’s own equity instruments. The acquisition and subsequent resale of treasury shares are transactions with the Company’s owners, rather than a gain or loss to the Company; - Consideration paid or received for the purchase or sale of an entity’s own equity instruments are recognised directly in equity; and - Once treasury share are cancelled or reissued, any diff erent is reclassifi ed to retained earnings. Dividends Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the entity, on or before the end of the reporting period but not distributed at the end of the reporting period. Revenue recognition The Group applies IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” for its revenue in the CMS segment. Revenue, consisting of commissions and collection fees, is recognised on collection of the claim. Subscription revenue is recognised proportionately Revenue from other services is reported when the relative performance obligation is fulfi lled. Income from property sales is reported when the buyer gains access to the property. The Group applies IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” for its revenue in the PI segment. See the section on “portfolio investment” within note 1 “Signifi cant accounting policies” for further details. Financial income and expenses Financial income and expenses consist of interest income on bank balances and receivables and interest-bearing securities, bank fees, interest expenses on loans, dividend income, exchange rate diff erences, realised and unrealised gains on fi nancial investments, and derivatives used in fi nancial operations. Payment guarantees The Group off ers guarantees to some of the its clients which require the Group to acquire the Client’s receivables at their nominal value, or a certain part thereof, if overdue more thana certain number of days stated in the agreement. The guarantee fee is recognised as revenue when the guarantees are issued. The Group also recognises a liability recognised for any expected losses on the receivables covered by the guarantees. If the receivable is eventually purchased, the purchased price, net of the liability for expected losses is recognised as portfolio investments. Earnings per share The Group applies IAS 33 “Earnings per Share”. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net earnings attributable to the Parent Company’s shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding shares during the year, excluding treasury shares. Diluted earnings per share adjusts the fi gures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the weighted average number of additional ordinary shares that would have been outstanding assuming the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. Segment reporting The Group applies IFRS 8 Operating Segments. Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM). The Group CEO has been identifi ed as CODM. An operating segment is a component of the Group (i) that engages in business activities from which it can earn revenue and incur expenses, (ii) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Group’s CODM to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and (iii) for which descrete fi nancial information is available. The Group operates in three segments: CMS, Portfolio Investments (PI) and Strategic Markets (Greece, Italy, Spain and Brazil). Parent Company’s accounting principles The Parent Company has prepared the Annual Report according to theAnnual Accounts Act (1995:1554) and recommendation RFR 2 Accountingfor Legal Entities from the Swedish Financial Reporting Board. RFR 2 means that the Parent Company, in the annual report for the legal entity, must apply all EU-approved IFRS and statements as far as possible within the framework of the Annual Accounts Act and taking into account the connection As of 2019, Intrum has made a new interpretation of the rules in RFR 2 Accounting legal entities, entailing the Parent Company’s exchange rate diff erences attributable to the hedging of the Group’s exchange rate risk in foreign operations no longer being reported under Other comprehensive income but under Net nancial items in the Parent Company’s income statement. The amended interpretation with regard to the Parent Company’s accounting has no impact on the consolidated nancial statements. _Diff erences between the Group’s and Parent Company’s accounting principles_ The diff erences between the Group’s and Parent Company’s accounting principles are indicated below. The accounting principles for the Parent Company as stated below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the Parent Company’s nancial statements. _Subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures_ Shares in subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures are recognised by the Parent Company at cost, including transaction costs less any impairment. Only dividends received are recognised as income. Credit risks in the Parent Company’s receivables from subsidiaries have been considered, showing no signi cant need for impairment. _Group contributions and shareholders’ contributions for legal entities_ The company reports Group contributions and shareholders’ contributions in accordance with statement RFR 2 of the Swedish Financial Reporting Board. Group contributions received are recognised as dividends and Group contributions paid are recognised as shareholders’ contributions. Shareholders’ contributions are recognised directly in the shareholders’ equity of the recipient and capitalised in the shares and participating interests of the contributor, to the extent impairment is not required. _Other_ The accounting rules for leasing in accordance with IFRS 16 that are applied in the consolidated accounts are also applied in the Parent Company’s accounts. Note 3 Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of fi nancial statements in accordance to IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions which infl uence the value of assets and liabilities as well as revenues and costs reported in the consolidated balance sheet and in the consolidated income statement, respectively or the disclosures included in the notes to the consolidated fi nancial statements in relation to potential assets and liabilities existing as of the date the consolidated fi nancial statements were authorised for issue. Estimates are based on historical experience and other factors. The resulting accounting estimates could diff er from the related actual results. Estimates are periodically reviewed and the eff ects of each change are refl ected in the consolidated income statement in the period in which the change occurs. The most signifi cant accounting principles which require a higher degree of judgment from management are illustrated below. _•_ _Valuation of goodwill : Goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test_ ----- This calculation requires management’s judgment based on information available within the Group and the market, as well as on past experience; _• Portfolio investments: the measurement of portfolio investments is based_ on the Group’s own projection of future cash fl ows from the acquired portfolios which are based amount other factors on the macroeconomic environments, types of debtors and loan (e.g. secures/unsecured). Future projections are periodically reviewed and any changes in estimated cash fl ows are ultimately authorised by a central revaluation committee. _• Useful lifetimes of intangible and tangible fi xed assets: The useful lives_ and the amortisation method of these intangible assets are assessed for appropriateness on an annual basis; _• Valuation of deferred tax assets: The valuation of deferred tax assets is_ based on forecasted results which depend upon factors that could vary over time and could have signifi cant eff ects on the valuation of deferred tax assets; _• Income taxes: The Group is subject to diff erent tax jurisdictions. The_ determination of tax liabilities for the Group requires the use of assumptions with respect to transactions whose fi scal consequences are not yet certain at the end of the reporting period. The Group recognises liabilities which could result from future inspections by the fi scal authorities on the basis of an estimate of the amounts expected to be paid to the taxation authorities. If the result of the abovementioned inspections diff ers from that estimated by Group management, there could be signifi cant eff ects on both current and deferred taxes; _• Provisions for risk: The determination of the amount of the accruals_ requires judgment by management based on available documentation and information on potential liabilities _• Benefi t plans: The Group participates in benefi t plans in various countries._ The present value of pension liabilities is determined using actuarial techniques and certain assumptions. These assumptions include the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets, the rates of future compensation increases and rates relative to mortality and resignations. Any change in the abovementioned assumptions could result in signifi cant eff ects on the employee benefi t liabilities; _• Control assessment: The Group regularly assesses control over its_ investee to determine whether such investees should be consolidated in the Group’s fi nancial statements. The assessment includes assessment of economic, operational and governance factors which may or may not be aligned with the legal structure of such investments. Since 2006, the Group has operations in Poland structured through investment funds to comply with the local regulation. The investments funds purchase and hold portfolio investments. The Group has control over these funds and thus the funds are consolidated in the Group’s fi nancial statements.Post2021 restructuring, the Group continues to have joint control over the Ithaca JV and accordingly, the co-investment is not consolidated in the Group’s fi nancial statements. _• Covid-19 Impact: On 25 March 2020, the Group assumed that the Covid-19_ would negatively aff ect the Group’s productivity and earnings for a certain period. Consequently, the assumption was that the Group would reduce the pace of its acquisitions to raise its yield requirements on new portfolio investments. However, the Group’s geographical spread, product diversifi cation and payments largely occurring automatically via online channels, resulted in stable cash flows during the Covid 19 reporting periods Note 4 Information by segment Group SEK M 2021 2020 External revenues by segment Credit Management Services 4,102 4,375 Strategic Markets 5,624 5,409 Portfolio Investments 8,063 7,064 Total 17,789 16,848 External revenues by country Spain 2,806 2,471 Greece 2,617 1,861 Norway 1,647 1,212 Hungary 1,484 1,304 Italy 1,328 1,187 Finland 1,007 1,036 Germany 924 1,152 Sweden 846 1,023 France 756 737 Other countries 4,374 6,726 Total 17,789 16,848 Intra-Group revenues by segment Credit Management Services 1,228 1,637 Strategic Markets 247 244 Portfolio Investments 0 6 Elimination -1,475 -1,887 Total 0 0 Segment earnings Credit Management Services 1,429 1,613 Strategic Markets 1,974 1,547 Portfolio Investments 5,043 3,251 Group items 1,972 -1,716 Total operating earnings 6,475 4,695 Net fi nancial items -2,174 -2,062 Profi t before tax 4,301 2,633 Tangible and intangible fi xed assets by country Norway 5,562 5,241 Spain 6,600 6,742 Italy 4,917 5,049 Germany 1,138 1,128 Greece 3,132 3,380 France 1,063 1,049 Finland 4,142 4,079 Other countries 12,166 11,821 T t l 38 719 38 489 Group SEK M 2021 2020 Investments in tangible and intangible fi xed assets Credit Management Services 75 295 Strategic Markets 78 183 Portfolio Investments Group items 182 194 Total 334 672 Amortisation/depreciation Credit Management Services -326 -348 Strategic Markets -1,055 -1,092 Portfolio Investments -11 -11 Group items -108 -77 Total -1,500 -1,529 Not included in cash fl ow Credit Management Services 10 -74 Strategic Markets -313 684 Portfolio Investments 0 0 Group items 40 -40 Total -263 570 Participations in joint ventures Credit Management Services - Strategic Markets - Portfolio Investments 293 -734 Group items - Total 293 -734 Total revenues by segment Credit Management Services 6,299 6,607 Strategic Markets 6,011 5,755 Portfolio Investments 8,063 7,064 Group eliminations -2,584 -2,578 Total 17,789 16,848 Applied segments are Credit Management Services, Strategic Markets and Portfolio Investments.

The Group’s Swedish companies paid no income tax for the year as they were able to utilise tax loss carryforwards from historic losses, as well as from the tax loss for the year attributable to interest expenses and exchange rate losses. In 2020, due to a change in timing of taxable revenue on portfolios owned by a subsidiary in Switzerland, there was a substantial shift between current tax and deferred tax attributable to previous years.

Deferred tax assets are reported in the balance sheet when it is expected to be possible to off set the tax loss carryforwards against taxable profi ts within the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reported net if they relate to the same tax authority or are planned to be utilised simultaneously. The Group has tax loss carryforwards that can be utilised against future taxable earnings totalling SEK 6,271 M (3,200). Recognised deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards amounted to SEK 728 M at 31 December 2021 and include SEK 657 M in Sweden, SEK 34 M in Spain, SEK 17 M in France, SEK 9 M in the Netherlands, SEK 5 M in Austria, and SEK 5 M in the UK. Interest and tax loss carryforwards for which no deferred tax assets are reported are SEK 3,879 M of which SEK 2,092 M is in Sweden, SEK 431 M in the UK, and SEK 334 M in Germany. These listed amounts detail the larger instances where it is believed that there is a chance that all or some of the carryforwards eventually can be utilised. Tax expenses reported in other comprehensive income during the year amounted to SEK 74 M (-208), of which SEK 81 M pertained to currency hedging and SEK -7 M pertained to revaluations of pension provisions.

Utilised previously unrecognised tax assets pertaining to tax loss carryforwards relate to the positive tax eff ect over the year arising from the utilisation of tax loss carryforwards not previously recognised as deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities When temporary diff erences arise between the tax value and carrying value of assets and liabilities, a deferred tax asset or tax liability is recognised. Such temporary diff erences mainly arise for portfolio investments, provisions for pensions and intangible assets. The deferred tax in 2021 is impacted, in the category Other, by a SEK 415 M deferred tax asset due to fees paid to a Greek subsidiary taxed in full in 2021, but recognised as revenue over time for accounting purposes. Deferred tax assets include the value of tax loss carryforwards in the instances where they are likely to be utilised to off set taxable surpluses within the foreseeable future. ----- Note 11 Intangible fi xed assets Below the roll-forward of the intangible fi xed assets for 2021 Group Parent Company Software and capitalised Software and capitalised SEK M dev expenses Client servicing assets Goodwill Tradenames Total dev expenses Tradenames Total Opening balance 768 4,936 31,650 159 37,513 287 12 298 of which Cost 2,584 8,037 31,650 398 45,652 391 20 411 Acc. amortisation -1,816 -3,102  - -239 -8,139 -104 -8 -112 Investment 254 - - 8 262 264 2 266 Disposals - -1 - - -0 - - Translation diff erence 7 105 1,031 3 1,146 Amortisation of the period -258 -904 - -25 -1,187 -50 -6 -56 other movement - - 77 - 77 Closing balance 771 4,136 32,758 146 37,811 501 7 508 of which Cost 2,196 8,169 32,758 423 46,493 631 21 652 Acc. amortisation -1,425 -4,033  - -278 -8,682 -130 -14 -144 Closing balance 771 4,136 32,758 146 37,811 501 7 507 And 2020 Group Parent Company Software and capitalised Software and capitalised SEK M dev expenses Client servicing assets Goodwill Tradenames Total dev expenses Tradenames Total Opening balance 677 6,104 33,356 192 40,329 124 16 140 of which Cost 2,415 8,426 33,356 517 47,760 206 19 225 Acc. amortisation -1,739 -2,322  - -326 -7,497 -82 -3 -85 Investment 340 -19 4 1 326 184 1 185 Disposals -6 - -3 -1 -9 - - 0 Translation diff erence -19 -212 -1,706 -7 -1,944 Amortisation of the period -224 -910 -0 -28 -1,163 -22 -6 -28 other movement 0 -27 -0 2 41 Closing balance 768 4,936 31,650 159 37,513 286 11 298 of which Cost 2,584 8,037 31,650 398 45,652 390 20 410 Acc. amortisation -1,816 -3,102  - -239 -8,139 -104 -9 -113 Closing balance 768 4,936 31,650 159 37,513 286 11 298 ----- Goodwill Goodwill is monitored by management at the level of the Credit Management Services and Strategic Markets segments, which also constitute separate cash-generating units (CGUs). The recoverable amount of each CGU has been verifi ed by comparing its net assets carrying amount to its value in use which has been determined using post tax cash fl ow forecasts Prepared by management on the basis of historical results as well as Group’s own expectations on future trends in the CMS business. The calculation is based on a detailed forecast for the years 2022–2026 and on an extrapolation for the period 2027–2029. with a growth rate decreasing over the forecast period until it reaches a perpetual growth rate of equilibrium of 1.5 percent in 2029. At the end of the eight year projected cash fl ow period, a terminal value was estimated in order to refl ect the value of the CGUs in future years. The terminal values were calculated as a perpetuity at the same growth rate as described above and represent the present value, in the last year of the forecast, of all future perpetual cash fl ows. The cash fl ows have been discounted to present value applying the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, which is estimated at 6.0 percent (6.0) per year before tax, corresponding to 4.5 percent (4.7) per year after tax. The impairment test performed as of the balance sheet date resulted in a recoverable value greater than the carrying amount (net operating assets) of the above mentioned CGUs. In percentage terms, the surplus of the recov erable amount of the CGU over the carrying amount was equal to 133 percent and 177 percent for Credit Management Services and Strategic Markets, respectively. A reduction in the recoverable amount of the CGU to a value that equals its carrying amount would require either of the following: (i) an increase in the discount rate to approximately 8.2 percent for Credit Management services and 10.5 percent for Strategic Markets; or (ii) change in the steady state growth rate to approximately -4.5 percent for Credit Management Services and -14.5 percent for Strategic Markets. In addition, reasonable changes to the abovementioned assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount (i.e., growth rate changes of +/-0.5 percent and discount rate changes of +/-0.5 percent) would not signifi cantly aff ect the impairment test results. Client servicing assets The customer contracts were acquired as part of a business combination in Italy, Spain and Greece. They are recognised at their fair value at the date of acquisition and are subsequently amortised on a diminishing balance method. Capitalised expenditures for IT developments It mainly relates to internally developed production system used by the Group in its credit management business. ----- Note 12 Tangible fi xed assets Below the roll-forward of the tangible fi xed assets for 2021 Group Parent company Computer Equipm, investment Improve- Other tangi- Total other ROU - Lease ROU - Lease ROU - Lease ROU - Lease Total fi xed Computer ROU - Lease Total fi xed SEK M hardware tools, fi xtu property ments ble assets fi xed assets property IT vehicles others Total ROU assets hardware vehicles assets Opening balance 53 117 2 21 18 211 777 7 44 4 831 1 042 12 1 13 of which Cost 203 387 2 72 103 768 1 135 9 80 7 1 231 1 999 18 2 20 Acc. amortisation -150 -270  - -51 -85 -557 -359 -2 -36 -3 -400 -957 -6 -1 -7 Investment 30 33 - 7 1 72 136 1 11 - 148 220 0 1 1 Disposals -1 -0 -2 - -0 -3 -1 -0 -2 -0 -3 -7 0 historical costs -17 -73 -2 -14 -9 -114 -49 -0 -11 -0 -61 -175 acc.

The Group and the Bank also entered into a Service Level Agreement (“the SLA”) for the exclusive management of the NPL portfolio owned by the Bank. In 2021 the Bank has removed some NPLs, originally included in the above -mentioned SLA, from its balance sheet and transferred them to some securitisation vehicles, Phoenix, Vega I, Vega II, Vega III, Sunrise I and Sunrise II, (the “SPVs”). The Group has entered into new service level agreement with the SPVs for the management of transferred NPLs. The Group has also invested in the mezzanine and junior notes issued by the SPVs. Based on the co-investor agreement all signifi cant fi nancial and operating decisions have to be taken jointly by the co-investors. The Group has therefore determined that it joint-controls the SPVs which are, thus, measured in the Group’s consolidated fi nancial statements using the equity method. The tables below provide summarises fi nancial information for Joint ventures which the Group deems signifi cant or were set up in 2021. The information disclosed refl ects the amounts presented in the fi nancial statements of the relevant joint ventures and not the Group’s share of those amounts. They have been amended to refl ect adjustments made by the entity when using the equity method, including fair value adjustments and modifi cations for diff erences in accounting policy: The below table reports the movements in the Investments in joint ventures in 2021 and 2020.

Ithaca invested in 51 percent of junior and mezzanine notes (the Notes) issued by the Italian special purpose vehicle “Penelope SPV S.R.L.” (Penelope), to fi nance the acquisition of a portfolio of Non- performing Loans (NPLs) sold by Banca Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP), which invested in the remaining 49 percent of the Notes. On 29 December 2021, Penelope was restructured and refi nanced with rated longer duration senior notes. The senior notes are intended to be eligible for a state guarantee, Garanzia Cartolarizzazione Soff erenze (GACS). As part of the restructuring, Ithaca’s holding in the Notes increased from 51 percent to 95 percent. In addition, Intrum reduced its holdings to the PPNs from 80 percent to 62.5 percent in Ithaca. Overall this resulted in a loss of SEK 40 M for Intrum. Intrum also entered into a derivative contract with certain funds managed or advised by CarVal Investors for a consideration of SEK 10 M, which allows it to acquire the latter’s 37.5 percent PPNs in Ithaca from 1 July 2023 to 31 December 2027 and also requires Intrum to do so once gross collections of SEK 12.8 bn have been achieved or on 31 December 2027. Evolve Spv Srl In April 2021 an Italian bank, BPER Banca, transferred a portfolio of Non-performing loans (NPL) portfolios to a newly established SPV that fi nanced the purchase of the portfolios by issuing notes. The Group, through an Irish DAC, Far Red 3, co-invested in the notes issued by the SPV with Deva Capitals. The Group subscribed 20 percent of the notes issued, the remaining 80 percent being subscribed by Deva Capitals investment to 80% of the notes issued. Based on the co-investor agreement, all signifi cant fi nancial and operating decisions have to be taken jointly by the co-investors. The Group has therefore determined that it joint-controls the SPV which is, thus, measured in the Group’s consolidated fi nancial statements using the equity method. ----- Ithaca Evolve Phoenix Vega I Vega II Vega III Sunrise I Portland Sunrise II SEK M 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 SUMMARISED BALANCE SHEET Cash and cash equivalents 1,404 1,192 29 - 384 - 113 - 376 - 177 - 559 - 143 - 33 Real estate assets 633 325 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Other assets 8,911 6,986 - - - - - - - - - - - - 42 - - Total current assets 10,948 8,503 29 - 384 - 113 - 376 - 177 - 559 - 185 - 33 Portfolio receivable 16,522 19,881 1,062 - 8,851 - 4,367 - 7,503 - 1,610 - 24,213 - 2,217 - 12,275 Other long term assets - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Total non current assets 16,522 19,881 1,062 - 8,851 - 4,367 - 7,503 - 1,610 - 24,213 - 2,217 - 12,275 Other liabilities 1,860 1,846 24 - 108 - 43 - 85 - 33 - 77 - 40 - 4 Total current liabilities 1,860 1,846 24 - 108 - 43 - 85 - 33 - 77 - 40 - 4 Financial liabilities 24,529 26,584 981 - 8,807 - 4,267 - 7,585 - 1,622 - 24,368 - 1,467 - 12,041 Other long term liabilities - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - **Total non-current liabilities** **24,529** **26,584** **981** **-** **8,807** **-** **4,267** **7,585** **-** **1,622** **-** **24,368** **-** **1,467** **-** **12,041** **- Net assets/(liabilities) 1,081 -47 86 - 320 - 170 - 208 - 132 - 327 - 895 - 263 SUMMARISED PROFIT AND LOSS Revenues 559 -670 163 - 135 - 68 - 165 - 83 - 177 - 91 - 49 Prodution expenses -639 -566 -18 - -64 - -32 - -66 - -44 - -115 - -4 - -3 Other expenses -63 -25 -2 - -54 - -17 - -27 - -6 - -45 - -1 - -1 Interest expenses -617 -1,590 -57 - -108 - -43 - -85 - -33 - -77 - -10 - -4 Net Income/(loss) -760 -2,851 86 - -90 - -24 - -12 - -0 - -60 - 76 - 41 ----- Note 15 Portfolio investments Group SEK M 2021 2020 Acquisition cost, opening balance 57,617 55,880 Purchased Debt 7,028 5,012 Sale of portfolio -24 Translation diff erences and other movements 2,106 -3,275 Accumulated acquisition cost, closing balance 66,727 57,617 Amortisation, opening balance -29,959 -27,371 Amortisations -4,287 -4,158 Positive revaluations of portfolio investments 1,789 3,145 Negative revaluations of portfolio investments -1,656 -3,177 Sales and disposals -24 Translation diff erences and other movements -1,112 1,634 Accumulated amortisation, closing balance -35,249 -29,959 Closing book value 31,478 27,658 Partial portfolio sales during 2021 amount to SEK 96 M and has been recognised as revenue from portfolio investments in the Group’ statement of profi t & loss.

The VAT portion of the acquired receivable can be recovered from the tax authorities if it is not collected from the end-customer and is therefore recognised as a separate receivable. The portion that is expected to be recovered within 12 months is recognised as current. In the Netherlands, bailiff s are private companies and expenses for collection cases paid to them can sometimes be recovered from the bailis if their collection measures fail.

Group employees in Switzerland, and certain employees in Germany, are covered by pension plans funded through assets under the management of insurance companies and are reported as defi ned benefi t pension plans. In particular in Switzerland, the Group has an commitment to fund service pension plans funded through insurance policies based on the Swiss Life Collective BVG Foundation and in Transparenta BVG Foundation. The funded commitments currently amount to SEK 350 M (324), and the fair value of the assets under management is SEK 257 M (234), resulting in a net pension liability is SEK 93 M (91). The pension commitment is funded through insurance contracts. During the year Intrum paid SEK 26 M (41) to the plan, while disbursements to retirees amounted to SEK 36 M (41). For these pension plans, a discount rate of 0.80 per cent is applied. An increase/decrease in the discount rate by 0.5 percentage points would entail the pension liability decreasing by 8 per cent/increasing by 9 per cent Other employees in Germany, in Norway, in France, Greece and Italy are covered by unfunded defi ned benefi t pension plans that can be paid out as a one-time sum or as monthly payments following retirement. In particular in Greece, as further detailed in note 1 “Signifi cant Accounting Policies”, the interpretation on IAS 19 issued by IFRIC in April 2021, resulted in a reduction of the liability of approximately SEK 69 M. In Belgium and Sweden, there are pension plans, funded through insurance. In particular in Sweden, the Group is covered by collective agreement (Almega / Unionen / Akademikerförbunden) and is obliged to ensure collective agreed pensions and insurance for its employees. The pension plan is called ITP and made of ITP 1 which includes employees born in 1979 or later and ITP2 which covers employees born in 1978 or earlier. ITP 1 is a defi ned contribution plan. According to a statement from the Swedish Financial Reporting Board, UFR 10, the ITP 2 plan is a multi-employer defi ned benefi t plan The Group accounts for its participation in the plan as if it were a defi ned contribution plan as suffi cient information on its proportional share of plan assets, liabilities and costs, could not be obtained by Alecta which manages the plans. There is no contractual agreement that states how surpluses and defi cits in the plan are to be distributed among plan participants. The premium is individually calculated, depending on salary, previously vested pension and anticipated remaining term of employment. At year-end Alecta’s surplus in the form of the collective funding ratio was 172 per cent (148). The collective funding ratio consists of the market value of Alecta’s assets as a percentage of the insurance obligations. Under the provisions of the ITP 2 plan, measures must be taken if the funding ratio falls below 125 per cent (for example, in connection with an increase in the price of the subscription) or exceed 150 per cent (155) (for example, in connection with a premium reduction). Note 22 Shareholders’ equity Share capital According to the Articles of Association of Intrum AB (publ), the company’s share capital will amount to not less than SEK 1,300,000 and not more than SEK 5,200,000. All shares are fully paid in, carry equal voting rights and share equally in the company’s assets and earnings. No shares are reserved for transfer. There are 120,797,264 shares in the company, and the share capital amounts to SEK 2,899,805. See below regarding repurchased shares. Share repurchase In 2020, 250,000 shares and 9,820,402 were repurchased for SEK 1.307 M and, in 2021, further 140,000 shares were repurchased for SEK 44 M and 66.346 were assigned to certain employees of the Group benefi ciaries of the 2018 long term incentive plan which vested in 2021. Accordingly, the number of shares outstanding at the end of 2020 was 120,870,918 and, at the end of 2021, there were 120,797,264 shares. The average number of shares outstanding over the year was 120,828,453 (123,913,717). Other shareholders’ equity in the Group _Other paid-in capital_ Refers to equity, other than share capital contributed by the owners or arising owing to the Group’s shared-based payment programs and also include the share premiums paid in connection with the issuance of new issues. Reserves Reserves includes the translation reserve, which contains all exchange rate diff erences that have, since the transition to IFRS in 2004, arisen on the translation of fi nancial statements from foreign operations as well as on long-term intra-Group receivables which are considered as permanent investment in the Group’s foreign operations. Reserves also include the exchange rate gains and losses arising in the Parent Company’s external loans in foreign currency, which are intended to hedge the Group’s translation exposure attributable to net assets in foreign subsidiaries. Retained earnings including net earnings for the year Refer to earnings in the Parent Company and subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated companies. Provisions to the statutory reserve, excluding transferred share premium reserves, were previously included in this item. Accumulated revaluations of the Group’s defi ned benefi t pension provisions are also included. Dividends paid and share repurchases are deducted from the amount. Following the balance sheet date, the Board of Directors proposed a dividend of SEK 13.5 per share (12,0), or a total estimated payout of SEK 1,631 M (1,450). Other shareholders’ equity in the Parent Company _Statutory reserve_ Refers to provisions to the statutory reserve and share premium reserve prior to 2006. The statutory reserve is restricted equity and may not be reduced through distributions of earnings. Share premium reserve When shares are issued at a premium, the amount exceeding their quota value is transferred to the share premium reserve. Provisions to the share premium reserve as of 2006 are non-restricted equity. Fair value reserve Refers to unrealised exchange rate gains or losses on external loans in foreign currency, which are intended to hedge the Group’s translation exposure attributable to net assets in foreign subsidiaries. The fair value reserve is non-restricted equity. Earnings brought forward Refer to retained earnings from the previous year less the dividend paid and share repurchases. Retained earnings are non-restricted equity. Capital structure The company’s defi nition of capital corresponds to shareholders’ equity including holdings without a controlling interest, which at year-end totaled SEK 25,074 M (21,963). The measure of the company’s capital structure used for control purposes is consolidated net debt in relation to pro forma rolling 12-month-adjusted cash EBITDA, which at year-end amounted to 3.9x (4.0x). This ratio is calculated by placing current consolidated net debt at the end of the year in relation to pro forma cash EBITDA, including operations being phased out and including a calculated cash EBITDA throughout the period for larger units acquired during the year, and excluding non-recurring items (NRIs). Net debt is defi ned as the sum of interest-bearing liabilities and pension provisions less liquid funds and interest-bearing receivables. The Board of Directors has established fi nancial targets for the Group, in which net debt divided by pro forma rolling 12-month-adjusted cash EBITDA, as stated above, shall be between 2.5x and 3.5x in the long term.

The loan facility is arranged with a banking consortium comprising 14 banks and applies until January 2026. The loan facility contains operations-related and fi nancial covenants, including limits on specifi c fi nancial indicators. In addition, the credit agreement includes covenants that may restrict, condition or prohibit the Group from incurring additional debt, making acquisitions, disposing of assets, making capital and fi nance lease expenditures, allowing assets to be encumbered, changing the scope of the Group’s business and entering into a merger agreement. As of 31 December 2021, the loan framework had been utilised in the total amount of SEK 4,167 M (2,223), which can be broken down into SEK 2,300 M, NOK 1,120 M and EUR 70 M. The unutilised portion of the facilities amounted to SEK 14,966 M (14,927). The loan carries a variable interest rate based on the interbank rate in each currency, with a margin. All operational and fi nancial covenants were fully met in 2021. In July 2021, Intrum issued a three-year unsecured bond of SEK 1,500 M at STIBOR 3m +325 basis points under the Swedish MTN programme. The proceeds were used to refi nance the EUR 150 M fi xed-rate bond maturing in 2022. In September Intrum issued a fi ve-year unsecured bond under the Swedish MTN programme of SEK 1,000 M at STIBOR 3m +330 basis points. The proceeds of this issue were used to repay outstanding amounts under Intrum’s revolving credit facility. In November a MTN of SEK 1,000 M matured and was refi nanced by a drawdown on the revolving credit facility. Consequently, Intrum has outstanding bond loans for a total of SEK 44,660 M (43,780) During 2021 commercial papers increased by SEK 1,082 M. At the end of the year, commercial papers amounted to SEK 3,998 M (2,916). The increase in commercial papers issued was used to repay outstanding amounts within Intrum’s credit facility. ----- Change in borrowings for the year Group SEK M 2021 2020 Opening balance 48,703 50,625 Borrowings 27,295 48,721 Amortisation of loans -23,864 -48,711 Eff ects of acquisitions and divestments -663 103 Exchange rate diff erences 1,030 -2,035 Closing balance 52,501 48,703 Bonds outstanding as per 31 December 2021 Nominal Interest rate for fi xed-rate Market value amount bonds and margin for of bond Designation Currency (M) SEK M Maturity date variable-rate bonds SEK M SEK 2022 Float SEK 750 750 2022-09-12 2,50% 751 EUR 2023 Float PP EUR 160 1,640 2023-06-22 1,31% 1,642 SEK 2023 Float SEK 2,900 2,900 2023-07-03 3,25% 2,915 EUR 2024 Fix EUR 900 9,225 2024-07-15 3,13% 9,238 SEK 2024 Float SEK 1,500 1,500 2024-10-01 3,25% 1,501 EUR 2025 Fix PP EUR 75 769 2025-03-15 3,00% 780 EUR 2025 Fix EUR 850 8,713 2025-08-15 4,88% 9,036 SEK 2025 Float SEK 1,250 1,250 2025-09-12 4,60% 1,306 EUR 2026 Fix EUR 800 8,200 2026-07-15 3,50% 8,290 SEK 2026 Float SEK 1,000 1,000 2026-09-09 3,30% 978 EUR 2027 Fix EUR 850 8,713 2027-09-15 3,00% 8,568 Total 44,660 45,006 Bonds with “Fix” in the denomination mature at fi xed interest rates.

This entails a risk being incurred that Intrum must compensate the customer for the guaranteed amount in the event that the invoices are not paid on time. In those cases where the guarantee comes into play, Intrum assumes the client’s claim against its customer and takes over the continued handling of the case within the Portfolio Investments area of operations.

The notice period may not exceed six months without any right to severance pay when termination is made by the GMT member. Remuneration for non-compete undertakings shall compensate for loss of income. The remuneration amounts to not more than 100 percent of the Base Salary at the time of termination of employment, unless otherwise provided by mandatory collective agreement provisions, and shall be paid during the time the non-compete undertaking applies, however not for more than twelve months following termination of employment. _Remuneration and employment conditions for employees_ In preparation of the Board’s proposal for these guidelines and when evaluating whether the guidelines and the limitations set out herein are reasonable, account has been taken regarding the remuneration and employment conditions for employees of the company. This has been done by reviewing e.g. the employees’ total remuneration, the components of their remuneration and remuneration growth rate over time. _The decision-making process to determine, review and implement the guidelines_ The Board has established a Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration Committee’s tasks include preparing the Board’s decision to propose these guidelines. The Board shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year and submit it to the Annual General Meeting. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the Annual General Meeting. The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor and evaluate programs for variable remuneration for the GMT, the application of the guidelines for GMT as well as the current remuneration structures and compensation levels in the company. The members of the Remuneration Committee are independent of the company and the GMT. The CEO and other members of the GMT do not participate in the Board’s processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are aff ected by such matters. _Derogation from the guidelines_ The Board may temporarily resolve to derogate from the guidelines, in whole or in part, if in a specifi c case there is special cause for the derogation and a derogation is necessary to serve the company’s long-term interests, including its sustainability, or to ensure the company’s fi nancial viability. As set out above, the Remuneration Committee’s tasks include preparing the Board’s resolutions in remuneration-related matters. This includes any resolutions to derogate from the guidelines. _Description of material changes to the guidelines and how the views of shareholders’ have been taken into consideration_ These guidelines do not entail any signifi cant changes in relation to the company’s existing guidelines, apart from the section about extraordinary arrangements. The company has not received any views from shareholders to take into consideration. _Information on remuneration resolved but not yet due and on derogations from the remuneration guidelines resolved by the Annual General Meeting 2020_ Note 31 Terms and conditions of employment for top management Guidelines on remuneration and other terms of employment for top management The Board proposes that the following guidelines for executive remuneration shall be approved by the annual general meeting. The proposal has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee of the Board. The guidelines apply to the CEO and other members of Intrum’s Group Management Team (“GMT”). The guidelines are forward-looking, i.e. they are applicable to agreements on remuneration, and on amendments to remuneration already agreed, enter into after adoption of the guidelines by the Annual General Meeting 2021. These guidelines do not apply to any remuneration to be separately resolved or approved by the General Meeting. _The guidelines’ promotion of the company’s business strategy, long-term interests and sustainability_ Intrum’s business strategy is, in short, to continue to grow, both in existing and new markets, and to continue to build its position as the undisputed market leader within the credit management industry. For more information regarding the company’s business strategy, visions and goals, please see www.intrum.com. A prerequisite for the successful implementation of the company’s business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests, including its sustainability, is that the company is able to recruit and retain qualifi ed employees. To this end, it is necessary that the company off ers competitive remuneration. These guidelines enable the company to off er the GMT a competitive total remuneration. Long-term share-related incentive programmes (“LTIPs”) have been implemented in the company. Such LTIPs have been adopted by the Annual General Meeting and are therefore excluded from these guidelines. The LTIP proposed by the Board to be adopted by the Annual General Meeting 2021 is excluded for the same reason, as well as similar programs to be adopted in the future. The proposed LTIP essentially corresponds to existing LTIPs. The LTIPs includes the GMT and other key employees in the company. The evaluation metrics used to assess the outcome of the LTIPs are distinctly linked to the business strategy and thereby to the company’s long-term value creation. Variable cash remuneration covered by these guidelines shall aim at promoting the company’s long-term business strategy and short-term interests, including its sustainability. _Forms of remuneration_ Remuneration in the company should refl ect job complexity, responsibility and performance, and it should be competitive in comparison with comparable companies within similar industries in the relevant geographies. The remuneration shall consist of the following components: annual fi xed cash salary (“Base Salary”), annual variable cash remuneration (“Variable Salary Part/VSP”), pension benefi ts and other benefi ts. Additionally, the General Meeting may – irrespective of these guidelines – resolve on, among other things, share-related or share price-related remuneration such as LTIPs. _Base Salary_ The Base Salary is based on three cornerstones: job complexity & responsibility, performance and local market conditions. The Base Salary is subject to _Variable Salary Part_ Intrums Variable Salary Part (“VSP”) aims to drive, and is designed to vary with, short-term business performance, and is set for one year at a time. The evaluation metrics are individually decided for each member of the GMT, and consist of fi nancial results (on group level or country level/s, as applicable) such as cash EBIT, cash Return on Invested Capital Portfolio Investment Service Line Earnings, Return On Investments and Book Value Growth. Members of the GMT may also have a smaller portion of targets linked to operational or non-fi nancial metrics, such as for instance Employee Engagement Index. The Board may also decide to adjust the metrics targets or apply other similar evaluation metrics if deemed appropriate. The maximum VSP pay-out is 100 percent of the Base Salary for the CEO and the CFO. For the other members of the GMT (except for the Chief Risk Offi cer, who is not eligible for VSP) the normal maximum VSP pay-out is 35 to 50 percent of the Base Salary. To which extent the evaluation metrics for awarding VSP have been satisfi ed is evaluated and determined when the measurement period has ended. The company’s Remuneration Committee is responsible for preparing the VSP evaluation for all GMT members. The determination of the VSP outcome is then resolved by the Board in its entirety. No deferral periods are applied in relation to VSP and the VSP agreement does not contain any clause entitling the company to reclaim VSP. _Extraordinary arrangements_ Other one-off arrangements can be made on individual level in extraordinary circumstances when deemed necessary and approved by the Board. The purpose might be in relation to recruitments, retention of top talent needed to secure successful implementation of the business strategy. Any such arrangement need to be capped at an amount equal to two (2) times the individual’s annual fi xed salary. Pension benefi ts and other benefi ts Intrum applies a retirement age of 65 for all members of the GMT, unless otherwise follows from applicable national rules. For the CEO, pension benefi ts, including health insurance (Sw: sjukförsäkring), shall be premium defi ned. VSP does not constitute pensionable income. The pension premiums for premium defi ned pension shall amount to not more than 35 percent of the Base Salary. For other GMT members, pension benefi ts, including health insurance, shall be premium defi ned unless the individual concerned is subject to defi ned benefi t pension under mandatory collective agreement provisions. Variable cash remuneration shall qualify for pension benefi ts to the extent required by mandatory collective agreement provisions. The pension premiums for premium defi ned pension shall amount to not more than 30 percent of the Base Salary. Other benefi ts than pension benefi ts may include, for example, life insurance, medical insurance (Sw: sjukvårdsförsäkring), housing and company cars. For GMT members with housing benefi ts, such benefi ts may not amount to more than 20 percent of the Base Salary. For GMT members without housing benefi ts, such benefi ts may not amount to more than ten percent of the Base Salary. _Termination of employment_ The notice period may not exceed twelve months if notice of terminati f l t i d b th B S l d i th ti ----- Annual General Meeting. In short, these guidelines entail that Base Salary and VSP shall be payable on conditions similar to what has been described in these guidelines. Base Salary and VSP is expensed during the fi nancial year, and VSP is paid out after the year-end report has been adopted by the Board. The guidelines adopted by the Annual General Meeting 2020 have been adhered to without derogation, and all previously approved remuneration that has not yet been paid out is in line with the framework set out above. Terms of employment and remuneration of the CEO Anders Engdahl, President and CEO, had a level of remuneration during 2021 in accordance with the Group’s principles as detailed above. His fi xed monthly salary as CEO has been EUR 58,333. In addition to his fi xed salary, he had the opportunity to receive up to 100 percent of his annual salary within the framework of the variable salary component (VSP) and up to 150 percent of his annual salary within the framework of the 2019 long-term remuneration programme (LTI). He was off ered participation in LTIP 2021 with an initial allocation of 200 percent of his fi xed annual salary. In addition to his salary, the company paid pension contributions corresponding to 30 percent of his fi xed annual salary. The pension policy is a defi ned contribution plan, and the retirement age is 65 years. He also had a company car in accordance with the Group’s car policy. In the event of resignation by the employee, the period of notice is twelve months and, in the event of termination by the company, the period of notice is twelve months. In the event of termination on the part of the company, severance pay of 12 months’ fi xed salary is payable. The outcome of LTIP 2019 was 100 percent, corresponding to 36,561 shares in Anders Engdahl’s case. The total number of shares outstanding for the CEO in LTI 2020 and 2021, which run until the end of 2022 and 2023 respectively, will be 138,946 shares if fully vested. Terms of employment and remuneration for other members of Group Management The remuneration and other terms of employment for other members of Group Management which were approved following the 2021 Annual General Meeting have followed the principles outlined above. This includes fi xed annual salary and the opportunity to receive 0–100 percent of annual salary within the framework of the variable salary component. The long-term incentive programme for 2021 was launched in April 2021 with allocation levels in accordance with the resolution of the Annual General Meeting, that is, 35–100 percent of fi xed annual salary. Pension benefi ts vary from country to country. In several cases, they are included in monthly salaries. All pension insurances plans are defi ned contribution plans, except in cases where mandatory collective agreements apply, and the retirement age is generally 65 years. Members of Group Management have company cars, in accordance with the Group’s car policy. Other benefi ts also occur, in accordance with local practices, including subsidised meals and travel. The notice of termination for members of Group Management Team varies from three to 12 months, regardless of whether termination is initiated by the employee or the company. LTIP 2019 was fully vested at the end of 2021 and, in accordance with the terms of the programme, the shares must be transferred prior to the 2022 Annual General Meeting. For Group Management (excluding the President and CEO), the maximum allotment in LTIP 2019 amounts to a total of 45,189 shares. The total number of shares outstanding in LTIP 2020 and 2021 for the corresponding group amounts to 197,724 shares. Remuneration for the year Other senior executives in the table are defi ned as members of the GMT other than the CEO, see the Corporate Governance Report. In 2021, fi ve individuals were appointed and three stepped down. At the end of 2021, there were 15 (13) other senior executives.

The most important currencies for the Intrum Group, other than the Swedish krona (SEK), are the euro (EUR), the Swiss franc (CHF), the Hungarian forint (HUF) and the Norwegian krone (NOK). The following exchange rates have been used to translate transactions in foreign currency in the fi nancial accounts: Average Average Currency 31 Dec 2021 31 Dec 2020 2021 2020 CHF 9.92 9.29 9.39 9.80 EUR 10.25 10.03 10.15 10.48 HUF 0.0278 0.0276 0.0283 0.0299 NOK 1.03 0.96 1.00 0.98 Exchange rate risk can be divided into transaction exposure and translation exposure. Transaction exposure consists of net operating and fi nancial receipts and disbursements in diff erent currencies. Translation exposure consists of the eff ects from the translation of the fi nancial reports of foreign subsidiaries and associated companies to SEK. _Transaction exposure_ In each country, all income and most operating expenses are denominated in local currencies, and thus currency fl uctuations have only a limited impact on the company’s operating earnings in local currency. National operations seldom have receivables and liabilities in foreign currency. Income and expenses in national currency are thereby hedged in a natural way, which limits transaction exposure. The currency exposure that arises within the operating activities is limited to the extent it pertains to international collection operations. The subsidiaries’ projected fl ow exposure is not hedged at present. All major known currency fl ows are hedged on a continuous basis in the Group and the Parent Company through forward exchange contracts. _Translation exposure_ Intrum operates in 25 countries. The results and fi nancial position of subsidiaries are reported in the relevant foreign currencies and later translated into SEK for inclusion in the consolidated fi nancial statements. Consequently, fl uctuations in the SEK exchange rate aff ect consolidated income and earnings, as well as equity and other items in the fi nancial statements. The Group’s revenues are distributed by currency as follows: SEK M 2021 2020 SEK 846 1,031 EUR 11,028 10,371 CHF 888 1,120 HUF 1,484 1,304 NOK 1,647 1,212 Other currencies 1,896 1,810 Total 17,789 16,848 Note 33 Financial instruments Group Parent Company SEK M Note 2021 2020 2021 2020 Carrying value of fi nancial instruments Financial assets valued at 1 41,088 34,521 41,431 33,933 amortised cost Financial assets valued at fair 2 118 295 107 295 value Total carrying value of fi nancial 41,206 34,816 41,538 34,228 assets Financial liabilities valued at 3 58,857 55,604 66,064 57,288 amortised cost Financial liabilities valued at fair 2 1,218 1,536 173 443 value Total carrying value of fi nancial 60,075 57,140 66,238 57,731 liabilities On the balance sheet date, the following fi nancial instruments amount to: Portfolio investments 1 31,478 27,658 - Accounts receivable 1 1,299 1,184 - Other receivables including 1, 2 3,876 3,840 40,936 33,695 accrued income The item includes derivatives and 118 295 107 295 other assets at FV of Cash and cash equivalents 1 4,553 2,134 602 533 Financial assets valued at 41,088 34,521 41,431 33,933 amortised cost Financial assets valued at fair 2 118 295 107 295 value Total carrying value of fi nancial 41,206 34,816 41,538 34,228 assets Long-term bank loans 3 4,060 2,081 4,060 2,081 Bond loan 3 44,443 43,706 44,443 43,706 Commercial papers 3 3,998 2,916 3,998 2,916 Accounts payable 3 504 493 23 49 Other liabilities including 2, 3 7,070 7,944 13,714 8,979 accrued expenses The item includes derivatives of 2 173 443 173 443 Other liabilities at FV 2 1,044 1,093 Financial liabilities valued at 58,857 55,604 66,064 57,288 amortised cost Financial liabilities valued at fair 2 1,218 1,536 173 443 value Total carrying value of fi nancial 60,075 57,140 66,238 57,731 liabilities for 1) Financial assets valued at amortised cost include portfolio investments, other long-term receivables, accounts receivable, client funds, other current receivables, accrued income, cash and cash equivalents and, for the Parent Company, also intra-Group receivables. 2) Financial assets and liabilities valued at fair value include derivative assets and liabilities, deferred considerations related to acquisitions of shares and other liabilities related to the acquisition of the minority interests in certain Spanish and Greek subsidiaries. Derivatives are measured based on valuation techniques that uses observable market data and thus fall under Level 2 in the valuation hierarchy according to IFRS 13. Deferred considerations and other liabilities are measured at fair value using non observable market data and, therefore, fall under in accordance with level 3 in the valuation hierarchy according to IFRS 13. 3) Financial liabilities valued at amortised cost include non-current and current liabilities to credit institutions, bond loans, commercial papers, client funds payable, accounts payable, advances from clients, other current liabilities, accrued expenses and, for the Parent Company, intra-Group liabilities. Note 34 Financial risks and fi nancial policies Principles of fi nancing and fi nancial risk management The fi nancial risks that arise in Intrum operations are limited. Thanks to a strong cash fl ow, combined with little need for investment and operating capital, external capital needs in the Group’s service operations are relatively low. The purchased debt operations have a greater need for capital, particularly during a growth phase. Intrum’s fi nancing and fi nancial risks are managed within the Group in accordance with the treasury policy established by the Board of Directors. The treasury policy contains rules for managing fi nancial activities, delegating responsibility, measuring and identifying fi nancial risks and limiting these risks. Internal and external fi nancial operations are concentrated in Group Treasury in Stockholm and Oslo. This achieves economies of scale in terms of pricing for fi nancial transactions. Because Group Treasury can take advantage of temporary surpluses and defi cits in the Group’s various countries of operation, the Group’s total interest expense can be minimised. ----- An appreciation of the Swedish krona of 10 percentage points on average in 2021 against EUR would thus, all else being equal, have aff ected revenues negatively by SEK 1,103 M, against CHF by SEK 89 M, against HUF by SEK 148 M and against NOK by SEK 165 M. In terms of net assets by currency, shareholders’ equity in the Group, including non-controlling interests, is distributed as follows: SEK M 2021 2020 SEK 5,979 11,988 EUR 27,250 23,498 - EUR hedged through foreign currency loans -25,626 -25,907 + EUR hedged through derivatives 7,116 6,745 CHF 662 685 - CHF hedged through derivatives 0 -106 DKK -15 -17 - DKK hedged through derivatives 0 -67 HUF 1,211 2,881 - HUF hedged through derivatives 0 -1,930 NOK 4,011 4,003 + NOK hedged through derivatives 157 -3,426 Other currencies 4,329 3,616 Total 25,074 21,963 All else being equal, an appreciation in the Swedish krona of 10 percentage points as per 31 December 2021 against EUR would have aff ected shareholders’ equity in the Group negatively by SEK 874 M, negatively against CHF by SEK 66 M, positively against DKK by SEK 1 M, negatively against HUF by SEK 121 M and negatively against NOK by SEK 417 M. Regarding the currency risk attributable to currency interest rate swaps, see the description below under Interest rate risks. The Group hedges part of its translation exposure by means of currency hedging measures, consisting of external loans in foreign currency and derivative instruments. There is an economic relationship between the hedged balance sheet items and the hedging instruments, in which the effi ciency of the hedge is tested and adjusted monthly. The eff ects of the translation exposure and hedging measures have opposite values (negative/positive) and are reported under Other comprehensive income. The hedging instruments amounted to SEK -27,283 M (- 31,141) at year-end. No ineffi ciencies were reported during the year regarding hedges of net investments in foreign operations. Interest rate risks Interest rate risks relate primarily to the Group’s interest-bearing net debt, which amounted to SEK 48,264 M (46,951) on 31 December 2021. The loan rate is tied to the market rate. Intrum has a strong cash fl ow which gives the Group the option of repaying loans or investing in portfolios. The Group’s loans have a fi xed interest term – currently about 33 months (44) for the entire loan portfolio. A 1-per cent increase in market interest rates during the year would have adversely aff ected net fi nancial items by approximately SEK 275 M. A fi ve-per cent increase would have adversely aff ected net fi nancial items by SEK 1,375 M. To establish an appropriate matching of currencies in the balance sheet and thus manage the currency risk between assets and liabilities, the company uses currency interest rate swaps in which the Parent Company swaps liabilities in SEK against NOK at the same rate on both the start and matu of shareholders’ equity per currency while also maintaining an interest rate exposure in the same currency. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk of a loss or higher-than-expected costs to ensure the Group’s ability to fulfi l its short and long-term payment obligations to outside parties. The Group’s long-term fi nancing risk is limited by confi rmed loan facilities. The Group’s objective is that at least 35 per cent of total committed loans have a remaining maturity of at least three years and that not more than 35 per cent of the total have a remaining maturity of less than 12 months. Intrum AB is fi nanced through a revolving syndicated loan facility, bonds, bilateral loans and commercial papers. The loan facility is arranged with a banking consortium comprising 14 banks and applies until January 2026. The loan facility contains operations-related and fi nancial covenants, including limits on specifi c fi nancial indicators. In addition, the credit agreement includes covenants that may restrict, condition or prohibit the Group from incurring additional debt, making acquisitions, disposing of assets, making capital and fi nance lease expenditures, allowing assets to be encumbered, changing the scope of the Group’s business and entering into a merger agreement. As of 31 December 2021, the loan framework had been utilised in the total amount of SEK 4,167 M (2,223), which can be broken down into SEK 2,300 M, NOK 1,120 M and EUR 70 M. The unutilised portion of the facilities amounted to SEK 14,966 M (14,927). The loan carries a variable interest rate based on the interbank rate in each currency, with a margin. All operational and fi nancial covenants were fully met in 2021. In July 2021, Intrum issued a three-year unsecured bond of SEK 1,500 M at STIBOR 3m +325 basis points under the Swedish MTN programme. The proceeds were used to refi nance the EUR 150 M fi xed-rate bond maturing in 2022. In September Intrum issued a fi ve-year unsecured bond under the Swedish MTN programme of SEK 1,000 M at STIBOR 3m +330 basis points. The proceeds of this issue were used to repay outstanding amounts under Intrum’s revolving credit facility. In November a MTN of SEK 1,000 M matured and was refi nanced by a drawdown on the revolving credit facility. Consequently, Intrum has outstanding bond loans for a total of SEK 44,660 M (43,780) During 2021 commercial papers increased by SEK 1,082 M. At the end of the year, commercial papers amounted to SEK 3,998 M (2,916). The increase in commercial papers issued was used to repay outstanding amounts within Intrum’s credit facility. The Group’s aim is that the liquidity reserve, which consists of cash, bank balances and short-term liquid investments should amount to at least SEK 100 M in addition to the unutilised portion of committed lines of credit. The Group has deposited its liquid assets with established fi nancial institutions where the risk of loss is considered remote. The Group’s fi nance function prepares regular liquidity forecasts with the purpose of optimising the balance between loans and liquid funds so that the net interest expense is minimised without, for that matter, incurring diffi culties in meeting external commitments. The table to the right provides an analysis of the fi nancial liabilities of the Group and the Parent Company broken down according to the amount of time remaining until the contractual maturity date. The amounts given in the table are the contractual, undiscounted cash fl ows. The amounts falling due within 12 months agree with the reported amounts since the discount eff ect is negligible.

Financial assets that potentially subject the Group to credit risk include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, portfolio investments, outlays on behalf of clients, derivatives and guarantees. For fi nancial assets owned by Intrum, no collateral or other credit reinforcements have been received, with the exception of a certain portion of the Group’s portfolio investments. The maximum credit exposure for each class of fi nancial assets ----- _Cash and cash equivalents_ The Group’s cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of bank balances and other short-term fi nancial assets with a remaining maturity of less than three months. The Group has deposited its liquid assets with established banks where the risk of loss is considered remote. _Accounts receivable_ The Group’s accounts receivable from clients and debtors in various industries, and are not concentrated in a specifi c geographical region. The Group’s largest client accounts for less than two per cent of revenues. Most accounts receivable outstanding are with customers previously known to the Group and whose creditworthiness is good. For an analysis of accounts receivable by age, see Note 17. _Portfolio investments_ As part of its portfolio investment operations, Intrum acquires portfolios of consumer receivables and tries to collect them. Unlike its conventional collection operations where Intrum works on behalf of clients in return for commissions and fees, in this case it assumes all the rights and risks associated with the receivables. The portfolios are purchased at prices signifi cantly below their nominal value, and Intrum retains the entire amount it collects, including interest and fees. The acquired receivables are overdue and in many cases are from debtors who are having payment problems. It is obvious, therefore, that the entire nominal amount of the receivable will not be recovered. On the other hand, the receivables are acquired at prices signifi cantly below their nominal value. The risk in this business is that Intrum, at the time of acquisition, overestimates its ability to collect the amounts or underestimates the costs of collection. The maximum theoretical risk is of course that the entire carrying value of SEK 31,331 M (27,658) would become worthless and have to be written off . To minimise the risks in this business, prudence is exercised in purchase decisions. The focus is on small and medium-sized portfolios with relatively low average amounts, to help spread risks. The average nominal value per case is approximately SEK 24,661. Portfolios are normally acquired from customers with whom the Group has had a long-term relationship. The acquisitions have generally consisted of unsecured debt, requiring relatively less capital and signifi cantly simplifying administration compared with collateralised receivables. Since 2016, however, Intrum has also begun to acquire portfolios with underlying collateral, usually in the form of property mortgages. Intrum places high yield requirements on the portfolios it acquires. Before every acquisition, a careful assessment is made based on a projection of future cash fl ows (collected amount) from the portfolio. In these calculations Intrum benefi ts from its extensive experience in debt collection and from the Group’s scoring methods. Intrum therefore believes that it has the expertise required to evaluate these types of receivables. To enable acquisitions of larger portfolios at attractive risk levels, Intrum has, on occasion, partnered with other companies such as Pireus Bank and Ibercaja Banco to share the capital investment and return. The currency risk is attributable to the translation of the balance sheet item Portfolio investments is limited due to currency hedging using loans in the same currency as the assets, and currency forwards. A considerable proportion of the acquisitions take place through forward fl ow agreements – that is, Intrum may have previously agreed with a company to acquire all of that company’s accounts receivable at a certain percentage of their nominal value once they are overdue by a certain number of days. In most of these agreements, however, Intrum has the opportunity to decline to acquire the receivables if, for example, their quality decreases. Risks are diversifi ed by acquiring receivables from clients in diff erent sectors and diff erent countries. The Group’s purchased debt portfolios include debtors in 24 countries. The Group’s total carrying amount for purchased debt is distributed as follows: Receivables by country UK, 13% (12) Norway, 12% (11) Spain, 10% (12) Germany, 9% (10) Receivables by industry Sweden, 8% (8) Hungary, 6% (7) France, 4% (5) Other countries, 38% (34) is because the counterparty generally is a large bank or fi nancial institution that is not expected to become insolvent. On the balance sheet date, assets regarding forward exchange contracts were valued at SEK 107M (295), and liabilities at SEK 173 M (443). See Note 33 regarding the possibility of off setting receivables and liabilities for derivative contracts. The contracts have short maturities, typically one or more months. All outstanding forward exchange contracts are restated at fair value in the accounts, with adjustments recognised in the income statement. The purpose of these forward exchange contracts has been to minimise exchange rate diff erences in the Parent Company attributable to receivables and liabilities in foreign currency. Outstanding forward exchange contracts at year end in the Parent Company and in the Group comprise the following currencies: Currency Local currency, buy Hedged amount, sell BRL - -6 CHF - -20 CZK 1,586 -50 DKK - -1,223 EUR 300 -27 GBP - -180 HUF 4,000 -35,500 NOK 215 -50 PLN 20 -62 RON - -122 SEK 5,743 -4,056 The Parent Company and the Group also hold currency interest rate swaps, which amount to SEK 1,457 M and that were signed in connection with the Parent Company’s issue of bonds in SEK. To achieve suitable currency matching between assets and liabilities, liabilities in SEK are exchanged to NOK at the same rate on the start - and maturity date. _Payment guarantees_ The Group off ers services whereby clients, against payment, obtain a guarantee from Intrum regarding the clients’ receivables from their customers. This entails a risk being incurred that Intrum must compensate the customer for the guaranteed amount in the event that the invoices are not paid on time. In those cases where the guarantee comes into play, Intrum assumes the client’s claim against its customer and takes over the continued handling of the case within the Portfolio Investments area of operations. At the end of the year, the total amount guaranteed was SEK 81 M (70). Intrum’s risk in this business is managed through strict credit limits and analyses of the borrower’s credit status. At the end of the year Intrum had allocated SEK 1 M (1) in the balance sheet to cover payments that may arise due to the guarantee. Telecom companies, 5% (6) Bank sector, 67% (66) Credit card receivables, 9% (10) Other fi nancial operations, 14% (12) Other segments, 5% (6) Of the total carrying value on the balance sheet date, 21 per cent represents portfolio acquisitions in 2021, 13 per cent acquisitions in 2020, 15 per cent acquisitions in 2019 and 11 per cent acquisitions in 2018. The remaining 40 per cent relates to receivables acquired in or before 2017, which have therefore been past due for more than four years. In the case of a large share of the oldest receivables, Intrum has reached agreement with the debtors on payment plans. _Outlays on behalf of clients_ As an element in its operations, the Group incurs outlays for court fees, legal representation, enforcement authorities, etc., which can be charged to and collected from debtors. In many cases Intrum has agreements with its clients whereby any expenses that cannot be collected from debtors are instead refunded by the client. The amount that is expected to be recovered from a solvent counterparty is recognised as an asset in the balance sheet on the line Other receivables. _Derivative contracts_ The Parent Company and the Group hold forward exchange contracts to a limited extent. The credit risk in the Group’s forward exchange contracts ----- The Group is responsible to withhold an amount equal to employees’ tax obligations associated with the share awards under local tax laws. The tax withheld is paid to the respective tax authorities on behalf of the respective employees. The performance shares granted under the LTIPs include a net settlement feature under which the shares necessary to settle the employee’s tax obligations are withheld. The Group is settling the share grant on a net basis by withholding the number of shares with a fair value equal to the monetary value of the employee’s tax obligation and only granting the remaining shares on completion of the vesting period. An amount of SEK 17,3 M was withheld and paid to the respective tax authorities in relation to the performance shares granted in March 2021 (2020 – nil). The cumulative expense recognised for the plans at the end of 2021 is SEK 85,6 M, of which SEK 26,3 M related to the 2018 plan, SEK 28,1 M related to the 2019 plan, SEK 13,8 M related to the 2020 plan and SEK 17,4 M related to the 2021 plan. Not 37 Events after the end of the year The 24 February 2022 Russia invaded Ukraine. For us at Intrum, the safety and well-being of our employees is the top priority and fortunately we have no operations and thus no employees in neither Ukraine nor Russia. We have though taken extra measures to provide help for employees with links to the invaded area. Intrum has insignifi cant business exposures towards the two countries, and only through a limited number of end-customers. These small amounts of collections were immediately paused. Not 38 Approval Date The Board of Directors have reviewed and approved the Annual and sustainability report as per 2022-04-01. Note 35 Related Parties In addition to associated companies and joint ventures, related parties include the Board of Directors and senior executives, according to Note 30, as well as close family members to these executives and other companies over which they can exert a signifi cant infl uence. All transactions with related parties are conducted on market terms and at arm’s length. Although the Parent Company has close relationship to its subsidiaries, see Note 13, it has no transactions with other related parties. Over the year, the Parent Company received SEK 690 M (557) in income from sales of services to Group subsidiaries, and incurred SEK 508 M (401) in expenses attributable to services purchased from subsidiaries. Note 36 Share-based payments Beginning in 2018, certain key employees were granted performance shares of Intrum AB, under the Group’s Long Term Incentive Plans (the “LTIPs”). The benefi ciaries of the plans are granted the right to receive ordinary shares, without consideration, if certain fi nancial targets set by the Board are achieved over a specifi ed three-year period. Under the LTIPs, eligible employees may be granted up to certain percentage of their annual base salary (“off ered amount”), worth of fully paid ordinary shares of the Company for no cash consideration. The number of shares assigned to the participants in the plans was the off er amount divided by the weighted average price at which the Company’s shares were traded on the Stockholm Stock Exchange during the 10 days up to and including the date of grant. Plans up to 2020 are subject to performance conditions as well as service conditions. The performance conditions used to assess the outcome of the LTIPs are distinctly linked to the business strategy and thereby to the Company’s longterm value creation. These metrics are linked to the Company’s Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) target established by the Board. Starting from 2021, the plans were extended to not only include senior managers but also other employees within the Group in order to maximise shareholders’ returns. Under the 2021 LTIPs, participants are granted performance shares which only vest if certain Total Shareholder Return (TSR) targets, including share price growth, dividends and capital return, are met over a period of three years. Participant also were granted with restricted shares which are only subject to service conditions. The Group treasury acquires shares from the market to transfer shares to employees on completion of vesting and performance conditions. Shares held by the Group and not yet issued to employees at the end of the reporting period are shown as treasury shares in the fi nancial statements. In March 2021 66,346 treasury shares were transferred to the participating employees under the 2018 LTIPs. The roll-forward of the instrumented granted as well as their weighted average fair value is reported in the below table (amount in thousand of Sek except for number of shares and fair value): 2021 2020 Units GD FV Amount Units GD FV Amount As at 1 January 369.504 234 86.377 238.582 228 54.432 granted during the 228.002 255 58.141 130.922 244 31.945 year forfeited during - - - - - the year Vested during the -128.320 234 -29.997 - - year As at 31 469.186 244 114.521 369.504 234 86.377 December The fair value of the Restricted shares has been calculated to SEK 263 using the Black-Scholes formula given the following assumptions: - Share price of SEK 263,62 using closing price of Intrum share at 29 April 2021 (SEK 303.50) less discounted value of dividends 2021-2023 SEK 39.88 - Volatility 49% (3 year historic share price volatility from 29 April 2021) - Risk free rate of return 0% (Swedish 5 year government bond 0.02% as of 29 April 2021) - Dividend yield 0% - Time horizon 3 years The fair value of the performance shares has been calculated to SEK 255 using Monte-Carlo simulations (10000 simulations) given the following assumptions: - Share price of SEK 263,62 using closing price of Intrum share at 29 April 2021 (SEK 303.50) less discounted value of dividends 2021-2023 SEK 39.88 - Share price of SEK 192.65 for performance measurement basis using volume weighted share price of Intrum share during the period 29 January 2021 to 25 February 2021 (SEK - 232.53) less discounted value of dividends 2021-2023 SEK 39.88 - Volatility 49% (3 year historic share price volatility from 29 April 2021) - Risk free rate of return 0% (Swedish 5 year government bond 0.02% as of 29 April 2021) - Dividend yield 0% - Time horizon 3 years - Minimum level corresponding to 5% share price CAGR SEK 223 (0% payout), target level corresponding to 14% share price CAGR SEK 285 (100% payout), maximum level - corresponding to 24% share price CAGR SEK 367 (150% payout) ----- ##### Proposed appropriation of earnings The Parent Company’s distributable funds are at the disposal of the Board of Directors as follows: SEK Share premium reserve 17,441,835,284 Retained earnings -7,446,350,120 Net earnings for the year 216,493,301 Total 10,211,978,465 The Board of Director propose that the earnings be distributed as follows[1]: SEK Dividend, 120,854,201 shares x SEK 13.5 1,631,531,714 Balance carried forward 8,580,446,751 Total 10,211,978,465 1) The total amount of the dividend payment and the amount carried forward as distributable retained earnings after the dividend pay-out, will be adjusted based on the amount of treasury shares held by Intrum at the record date for the dividend payment. The Board of Directors’ complete statement motivating the proposed disposition of earnings for the 2021 fi scal year will be presented in a separate document prior to the 2021 Annual General Meeting. It concludes, among other things, that the proposed dividend is in line with the Company’s dividend policy and that the Board, having considered the nature, scope and risks of the Company’s operations, as well as the Company’s and the Group’s consolidation requirements, liquidity and fi nancial position in general, has found no indications that the proposed dividend is unjustifi ed. The Board of Directors and the President certify that the Annual Report has been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards in Sweden and that the consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with the international accounting standards referred to in Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002 on the application of international accounting standards. Stockholm, 1 April 2022 Anders Engdahl President and CEO The annual accounts and consolidated accounts give a true and fair view of the fi nancial position and results of the Parent Company and the Group. The Board of Directors’ Report for the Parent Company and the Group gives a true and fair overview of the operations, fi nancial position and results of the Parent Company and the Group, and describes signifi cant risks and uncertainties that the Parent Company and the companies in the Group face. The annual and consolidated accounts were approved for publication by the Board of Directors and the President on 26 March 2022 and are proposed for approval by the Annual General Meeting on 29 April 2022.

Deloitte AB Patrick Honeth ----- ### Auditor’s report To the general meeting of the shareholders of Intrum AB (publ) Corporate Identifi cation Number: 556607-7581 Report on the Annual Accounts and Consolidated Accounts Opinions We have audited the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of Intrum AB (publ) for the fi nancial year 2021. The annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the company are included on F-pages 21-57 in this document. In our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the fi nancial position of the parent company as of 31 December 2021 and its fi nancial performance and cash fl ow for the year then ended in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act. The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the fi nancial position of the Group as of 31 December 2021 and their fi nancial performance and cash fl ow for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS, as adopted by the EU, and the Annual Accounts Act. The statutory administration report is consistent with the other parts of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. We therefore recommend that the general meeting of the shareholders adopts the income statement and balance sheet for the parent company and the Group. Our opinions in this report on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts are consistent with the content of the additional report that has been submitted to the parent company’s audit committee in accordance with the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 11. Basis for Opinions We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibility section. We are independent of the parent company and the Group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfi lled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. This includes that, based on the best of our knowledge and belief, no prohibited services referred to in the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 5.1 have been provided to the audited company or, where applicable, its parent company or its controlled companies within the EU. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su ffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. Other Information The audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts for the fi nancial year 2020 was performed by another auditor who submitted an audit report, dated 29 April 2021, with unmodifi ed opinions in the Report on the annual and consolidated accounts. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters of the audit are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signifi cance in our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts for the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of, and in forming our opinion thereon, the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Revenue Recognition of Credit Management Services _Description of Risk_ Revenue from credit management services, recognised as revenue from clients in the Group’s income statement, are generated from a number of diff erent revenue streams, including, but not limited to, debt collection services, credit optimisation services, e-commerce services, payment services, accounts receivable services, fi nancial services and collateral services. For 2021, revenue from credit management services amounted to SEK 10,149 million. The majority of these revenue streams are characterised by a large amount of transactions, which, in turn, is dependent on robust internal processes and controls as well as a well-functioning IT-environment. Taking the high volume transaction environment into account, as well as the signifi cance of the item for the Group’s fi nancial performance and cash fl ow for the year, we have assessed that revenue recognition from credit management services constitute a key audit matter in the audit. The Group’s accounting principles for revenue recognition from credit management services is presented in note 2. A specifi cation of the item, including a breakdown of main revenue streams and segments, can be found in note 4 and 5. _Our Audit Procedures_ Out audit procedures included, but were not limited to: - Evaluation of processes and controls associated with revenue from credit management services, including, but not limited to, compliance with contractual terms, revenue recognition, invoicing, and associated critical IT-systems and applications. - Substantive testing on a sample basis of revenue associated with credit management services vis-á-vis contractual terms, invoices and amounts paid. - Analytical review of items associated with revenue from credit management services. - Assessment of compliance with guiding principles and adequate disclosures for revenue from credit management services in accordance with IFRS. Valuation of Goodwill _Description of Risk_ Goodwill arising from business combinations constitutes a signifi cant item in the Group’s balance sheet and amounted to SEK 32,758 million as of 31 December 2021. The item is tested for impairment on a regular basis, at least annualy, based on the Group’s two cash-generating units. The recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit is measured by comparing the carrying amount of net assets to its value in use, which, in turn, is based on an assessment of forecasted cash fl ows from credit management services from each cash-generating unit discounted by the weighted average cost of capital. Taking the surrounding elements of estimates, judgements and assumptions associated with the valuation model’s key input data into account, as well as the signifi cance of the item for the Group’s fi nancial position, we have assessed that goodwill constitute a key audit matter in the audit. The Group’s accounting principles for goodwill is presented in note 2. Critical estimates, judgements and assumptions are disclosed in note 3. A specifi cation of the item, including a breakdown of cash-generating units and refl ections from the most recent impairment test performed, can be found in note 11. _Our Audit Procedures_ Out audit procedures included, but were not limited to: - Evaluation of processes associated with goodwill, including, but not limited to, budgeting, forecasts of cash fl ows from credit management services and tests of impairments. - Assessment of the Group’s cash-generating units. - Involvement of valuation specialists in order to assess and challenge the valuation model applied in connection with the Group’s impairment test, including evaluation of underpinning estimates, judgements and assumptions associated the the valuation model’s key input data in terms of cash fl ows from credit management services and the weighted average cost of capital used as discount rate vis-á-vis independent fi nancial market data and historical performance. - Analytical review of the sensitivity of estimates, judgements and assumptions as well as the headroom that the Group’s impairment test resulted in between the carrying amount of net assets and its value in use. - Assessment of compliance with guiding principles and adequate disclosures for goodwill in accordance with IFRS. ----- Accounting of Credit Impaired Financial Assets _Description of Risk_ A signifi cant part of the Group’s business consist of investments in credit impaired fi nancial assets, recognised as portfolio investments or via shares in joint ventures in the Group’s balance sheet. As of 31 December 2021, the Group’s portfolio investments amounted to SEK 31,478 million, whereas the Group’s shares in joint ventures amounted to SEK 6,438 million. The Group applies a centralised accounting model for credit impaired fi nancial assets that builds on the eff ective interest rate method, where the carrying value of each investment corresponds to the present value of all projected future gross cash fl ows discounted by the internal rate of return determined in connection with the acquisition of underlying assets. Movements in the carrying value of credit impaired fi nancial assets recognised as portfolio investments are recognised directly in the Group’s income statement, either as amortisations or as a revaluation eff ect, whereas movements in the carrying value of credit impaired fi nancial assets recognised via joint ventures are recognised indirectly as a share of profi t and loss from joint ventures calculated via the equity method. Taking the surrounding elements of estimates, judgements and assumptions into account, as well as the signifi cance of the investments for the Group’s fi nancial position, fi nancial performance and cash fl ow for the year, we have assessed that accounting of credit impaired fi nancial assets constitute a key audit matter in the audit. The Group’s accounting principles for portfolio investments and shares in joint ventures are presented in note 2. Critical estimates, judgements and assumptions are disclosed in note 3. A specifi cation of the item, including revenue and expenses from portfolio investments, can be found in note 4, 5 and 15. The corresponding specifi cation for shares in joint ventures can be found in note 14. Our Audit Procedures Out audit procedures included, but were not limited to: - Evaluation of processes and controls associated with credit impaired fi nancial assets, including, but not limited to, internal governance, underwriting, investments, accounting, valuations and exits, and associated critical IT-systems and applications. - Reperformance test of systematic monitoring activities carried out of actual gross cash fl ows in order to assess the reasonableness for forecasted (estimated) gross cash fl ows of acquired credit impaired fi nancial assets. - Reconciliation of carrying amounts vis-á-vis underlying investment data in associated IT-systems and applications. - Substantive testing on a sample basis of factors used in connection with the calculation of the discount rate (purchase price and forecasted future gross cash fl ows) and of changes reported in the income statement in the form of amortisations and revaluation eff ects. - Analytical review of items associated with investments in credit impaired fi nancial assets. - Involvement of valuation specialists in order to assess and challenge underpinning estimates, judgements and assumptions applied in connection with calculation of forecasted future gross cash fl ows. - Assessment of compliance with guiding principles and adequate disclosures for credit impaired fi nancial assets in accordance with IFRS. Other information than the annual accounts and consolidated accounts This document also contains other information than the annual accounts and consolidated accounts and is found on pages 1-53 and 106-120. Other information also includes the remuneration report. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for this other information. Our opinion on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts does not cover this other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion regarding this other information. In connection with our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, our responsibility is to read the information identifi ed above and consider whether the information is materially inconsistent with the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. In this procedure we also take into account our knowledge otherwise obtained in the audit and assess whether the information otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we, based on the work performed concerning this information, conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the preparation of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts and that they give a fair presentation in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and, concerning the consolidated accounts, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of annual accounts and consolidated accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the assessment of the company’s and the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They disclose, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis of accounting is however not applied if the Board of Directors and the Managing Director intends to liquidate the company, to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Audit Committee shall, without prejudice to the Board of Director’s responsibilities and tasks in general, among other things oversee the company’s fi nancial reporting process. Auditor’s Responsibility Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole are free from material mis statement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to infl uence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. A further description of our responsibility for the audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts is available on the Swedish Inspectorate of Auditors (SIA) website: revisorsinspektionen.se/revisornsansvar. This description is part of the auditor’s report. Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements Opinions In addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, we have also audited the administration of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director of Intrum AB (publ) for the fi nancial year 2021 and the proposed appropriations of the company’s profi t or loss. We recommend to the general meeting of shareholders that the profi t to be appropriated in accordance with the proposal in the statutory administration report and that the members of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director be discharged from liability for the fi nancial year. Basis for Opinions We conducted the audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibility section. We are independent of the parent company and the Group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfi lled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director The Board of Directors is responsible for the proposal for appropriations of the company’s profi t or loss. At the proposal of a dividend, this includes an assessment of whether the dividend is justifi able considering the requirements which the company’s and the Group’s type of operations, size and risks place on the size of the parent company’s and the Group’s equity, consolidation requirements, liquidity and position in general. The Board of Directors is responsible for the company’s organisation and the administration of the company’s aff airs. This includes among other things continuous assessment of the company’s and the Group’s fi nancial situation and ensuring that the company’s organisation is designed so that the accounting, management of assets and the company’s fi nancial aff airs otherwise are controlled in a reassuring manner. The Managing Director shall manage the ongoing administration according to the Board of Directors’ guidelines and instructions and among other matters take measures that are ----- necessary to fulfi ll the company’s accounting in accordance with law and handle the management of assets in a reassuring manner. Auditor’s Responsibility Our objective concerning the audit of the administration, and thereby our opinion about discharge from liability, is to obtain audit evidence to assess with a reasonable degree of assurance whether any member of the Board of Directors or the Managing Director in any material respect: - has undertaken any action or been guilty of any omission which can give rise to liability to the company, or - in any other way has acted in contravention of the Companies Act, the Annual Accounts Act or the Articles of Association. Our objective concerning the audit of the proposed appropriations of the company’s profi t or loss, and thereby our opinion about this, is to assess with reasonable degree of assurance whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect actions or omissions that can give rise to liability to the company, or that the proposed appropriations of the company’s profi t or loss are not in accordance with the Companies Act. A further description of our responsibility for the aufi t of the administration is available on the Swedish Inspectorate of Auditors (SIA) website: revisorsinspektionen.se/revisornsansvar. This description is part of the auditor’s report. The Auditor’s Examination of the ESEF Report Opinion In addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, we have also examined that the Board of Directors and the Managing Director have prepared the annual accounts and consolidated accounts in a format that enables uniform electronic reporting (the ESEF report) pursuant to Chapter 16, Section 4a of the Swedish Securities Market Act (2007:528) for Intrum AB (publ) for the fi nancial year 2021. Our examination and our opinion relate only to the statutory requirements. In our opinion, the ESEF report a77fc83b0fb1d419f2491239a5f425ebc 99cc985712e6358ef584c9b2db117fa has been prepared in a format that, in all material respects, enables uniform electronic reporting. Basis for Opinion We have performed the examination in accordance with FAR’s recommendation RevR 18 Examination of the ESEF report. Our responsibility under this recommendation is described in more detail in the Auditors’ Responsibility section. We are independent of Intrum AB (publ) in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfi lled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the preparation of the ESEF report in accordance with Chapter 16, Section 4a of the Swedish Securities Market Act (2007:528), and for such internal control that the Board of Directors and the Managing Director determine is necessary to prepare the ESEF report without material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error. Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance whether the ESEF report is, in all material respects, prepared in a format that meets the requirements of Chapter 16, Section 4a of the Swedish Securities Market Act (2007:528), based on the procedures performed. RevR 18 requires us to plan and execute procedures to achieve reasonable assurance that the ESEF report is prepared in a format that meets these requirements. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it is not a guarantee that an engagement carried out according to RevR 18 and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to infl uence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the ESEF report. The audit fi rm applies ISQC 1 Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of Financial Statements, and other Assurance and Related Services Engagements and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control, including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with professional ethical requirements, professional standards and legal and regulatory requirements. The examination involves obtaining evidence, through various procedures, that the ESEF report has been prepared in a format that enables uniform electronic reporting of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement in the report, whether due to fraud or error. In carrying out this risk assessment, and in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, the auditor considers those elements of internal control that are relevant to the preparation of the ESEF report by the Board of Directors and the Managing Director, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the eff ectiveness of those internal controls. The examination also includes an evaluation of the appropriateness and reasonableness of assumptions made by the Board of Directors and the Managing Director. The procedures mainly include a technical validation of the ESEF report, i.e., if the fi le containing the ESEF report meets the technical specifi cation set out in the Commission’s Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 and a reconciliation of the Esef report with the audited annual accounts and consolidated accounts. Furthermore, the procedures also includes an assessment of whether the ESEF report has been marked with iXBRL which enables a fair and complete machine readable version of the consolidated statement of fi nancial performance, fi nancial position, changes in equity and cash fl ow.

The address of the company’s headquarters is Hesselmans Torg 14, Nacka, SE–105 24 Stockholm, Sweden. During 2019, the company was listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm, Large Cap list. The consolidated accounts were approved for publication by the company’s Board of Directors on 1 April 2021. The balance sheets and income statements will be presented to the Annual General Meeting on 6 May 2021. The Parent Company’s functional currency is Swedish kronor (SEK), which is also the reporting currency for the Parent Company and for the Group. The fi nancial statements are therefore presented in SEK. All amounts, unless indicated otherwise, are rounded off to the nearest SEK M. The consolidated and annual accounts pertain to 1 January – 31 December for income statement items and 31 December for balance sheet items. Accounting standards applied With regard to the consolidated fi nancial statements, the Annual Report for Intrum AB (publ) has been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The Group applies IFRS as adopted by the European Union (EU). For 2019 and 2020, no new regulations relevant to Intrum came into eff ect in the IFRS issued by the IASB and that had not previously been adopted by the EU. This means that the Group’s application of IFRS as adopted by the EU during the year also corresponds to the application of IFRS as issued by the IASB. Further, recommendation RFR 1 Supplementary accounting rules for groups from the Swedish Financial Reporting Board has been applied. The Parent Company applies the same accounting principles as the Group except in the cases stated in the section “Parent Company accounting principles”. Assumptions Assets and liabilities are recognised at historical cost, with the exception of certain fi nancial assets and liabilities, which are measured at fair value. The preparation of fi nancial reports in accordance with IFRS requires the Board of Directors and Management to make estimates and assumptions that aff ect the application of the accounting principles and the carrying values of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and a number of other factors that under current circumstances seem reasonable. The result of these estimates and assumptions is then used to determine the carrying values of assets and liabilities that otherwise are not clearly indicated by other sources. Actual outcomes may deviate from these estimates and assumptions. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed regularly. Changes in estimates are recognised in the period in which the change is made, provided it has aff ected only this period, or the period the change was made and future periods if the change aff ects both current and future periods. fi nancial statements and estimates, which could necessitate signifi cant adjustments in fi nancial statements in subsequent years, are described in more detail in Note 36. The accounting principles described below for the Group have been applied consistently for all periods in the Group’s fi nancial statements, unless otherwise indicated. The Group’s accounting principles have been applied consistently in the consolidation of the Parent Company, subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures. Changes in accounting principles _Changes that entered into force in 2019_ The Group applies IFRS 16 Leases as of 2019. IFRS 16 stipulates that for both fi nancial and operational leases of signifi cance, a right-of-use asset and a lease liability are to be recognised. The exception is short-term leases and lease agreements for lower-value assets, for which lease fees are expensed on a straight-line basis. The right-of-use asset is recognised with linear amortisation over the term of the contract. The lease liability is recognised including interest expenses in accordance with the eff ective interest rate method. The introduction of IFRS 16 entails lease liabilities being recognised for lease agreements previously classifi ed as operational leases in accordance with IAS 17. These liabilities are valued at the present value of the future minimum lease payments, discounted at the marginal loan rate. Intrum applied the modifi ed retroactive method, meaning that the eff ect of introducing IFRS 16 was recognised directly against the opening balance without the comparison fi gures being recalculated. The principal eff ects on Intrum’s accounting were that the Group’s total assets increased by SEK 709 M, calculated as per the beginning of 2019, with both an asset and a liability being reported for leases in eff ect (and where the amount is updated annually), and with operating earnings improving by SEK 43 M annually through the implicit interest expense in the leases being reported in net fi nancial items rather than in operating earnings. Leases of low value (assets that, in new condition, have a value of less than approximately SEK 50,000) – primarily comprising IT and offi ce equipment – are not included in the leasing debt but continues to be expensed on a straight-line bases over the lease term. Accordingly, the amended accounting relates mainly to rented offi ce premises and cars. Other changes to IFRS are not expected to have any material eff ect on the consolidated accounts. Classifi cation issues Fixed assets and long-term liabilities in the Parent Company and the Group consist of amounts that are expected to be recovered or paid more than 12 months after the balance sheet date. Current assets and current liabilities in the Parent Company and the Group consist of amounts that are expected to be recovered or paid within 12 months of the balance sheet date. Consolidation _In subsidiaries_ The consolidated accounts include the annual accounts of all subsidiaries, i.e., companies in which the Parent Company, directly or indirectly, holds more than 50 per cent of the votes or otherwise can exercise control over operations. A controlling interest is achieved when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from, its commitment to the company and is able to aff ect returns by means of its decisive infl uence. An infl uence arises when the Group has existing rights enabling it to control the relevant operations, that is, the operations that signifi cantly aff ect the company’s performance. The consolidated accounts are prepared according to the acquisition method, which means that the acquisition of a subsidiary is treated as a transaction where the Group indirectly acquires the subsidiary’s assets and takes over its liabilities and contingent liabilities. The Group’s equity therefore includes only the portion of the subsidiary’s equity added since acquisition. The Group’s cost is determined through an acquisition analysis in connection with the acquisition. The analysis determines the cost of the shares or operations as well as the fair value of acquired, identifi able assets and assumed liabilities and contingent liabilities. The cost of the subsidiary’s shares or operations consists of the fair value of the compensation on the transfer date and transaction expenses directly attributable to the acquisition. The cost includes conditional purchase considerations recognised as liabilities at fair value per the acquisition date. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. In acquisitions where the cost exceeds the net value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities and contingent liabilities, the diff erence is reported as goodwill. When the diff erence is negative, it is recognised directly through profi t or loss. Non-controlling interests arise in cases where the acquisition does not relate to the entire subsidiary. There are two options for recognising non-controlling interests. The two options are to recognise the percentage of non-controlling interests that makes up proportional net assets, or to recognise non-controlling interests at fair value, which means that non-controlling interests form a percentage of goodwill. The method used for recognising non-controlling interests is made on a case by case basis. The fi nancial reports of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated accounts from the acquisition date until control ceases. Intra-Group receivables and liabilities, revenue and expenses, and unrealised gains and losses that arise from transactions within the Group are eliminated in their entirety in the consolidated accounts. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associated companies and joint ventures are eliminated to a degree corresponding to the Group’s ownership of those companies. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, to the extent there is an indication of impairment. _Associated companies and joint ventures_ The Group applies IAS 28 Investments in associates and joint ventures, and IFRS 11 Joint arrangements. Associated companies are companies that are not subsidiaries but where the Parent Company, directly or indirectly, has at least 20 per cent of the t th i i i ifi t i fl ith t h i t l ----- Participations in associated companies and joint ventures are recognised in the consolidated accounts according to the equity method, which means that the holding in the company is recognised at cost and subsequently adjusted to the Group’s share of the change in the associated company’s net assets. The value of the shares includes goodwill from the acquisition. The consolidated income statement includes the Group’s participation in the company’s earnings less goodwill impairment. The amount is reported under Participations in the earnings of associates and joint ventures. Dividends received from the company are not recognised in the income statement and instead reduce the carrying value of the investment. Any diff erence between the cost of an acquisition and the owner’s share of the net fair value of the associated company’s identifi able assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised in accordance with IFRS 3. The equity method is applied from the date a signifi cant infl uence arises until the time it ceases or the associated company becomes a subsidiary. If the Group’s share of reported losses in the company exceeds the carrying value of its participations, the value of those participations is reduced to nil. Losses can also be off set against the Group’s unsecured receivables from the company if they constitute part of the net investment. Further losses are not recognised provided the Group has not issued guarantees to cover them. _Joint ventures_ The Group applies IFRS 11 Joint arrangements. Joint arrangements pertain to companies in which Intrum and other part-owners manage operations jointly in accordance with a shareholder agreement. Joint arrangements classifi ed as joint ventures are reported in the consolidated accounts in accordance with the equity method. Joint ventures are companies in which the Group, through collaborative agreements, shares a controlling interest with one or more parties, such that the Group is entitled to net assets rather than having a direct entitlement to assets and responsibility for liabilities. Jointly owned companies are recognised at cost and subsequently adjusted for the Group’s share of the change in the company’s net assets. The consolidated income statement includes the Group’s share of earnings, and this is reported under Participations in the earnings of associates and joint ventures. Dividends received from joint ventures are not recognised in the income statement and instead reduce the carrying value of the investment. The equity method is applied from the date on which joint control is gained until the date that it ceases or transitions to the sole infl uence of Intrum. Shared operations, usually conducted in a company format, are joint arrangements in which Intrum and one or more partners are entitled to all of the fi nancial benefi ts related to the assets of the operations. Shared operations are reported according to the profi t split method, meaning that each party to a joint venture reports its share of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. _Foreign currency_ The Group applies IAS 21 Eff ects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. _Transactions in foreign currency_ Group companies prepare their accounts in the local functional currency in the country where they have their operations. Transactions in a currency other than the local currency are recognised at the exchange rate in eff ect on the transaction day. When such transactions are off set or settled, the h t d i t f th th t li d th t ti monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are translated at the exchange rates on each balance sheet date, due to which an (unrealised) exchange rate diff erence arises. Both realised and unrealised exchange rate diff erences of this type are recognised in the income statement – in the operating result if, for example, they refer to accounts receivable or accounts payable, or in net fi nancial items if they refer to fi nancial investments and borrowing in foreign currency. To avoid exchange rate diff erences, receivables and liabilities in foreign currency are sometimes hedged through forward exchange contracts. The Group’s holding of forward exchange contracts is marked to market on each balance sheet date, and changes in value are recognised through profi t or loss. _Translation of the fi nancial statements of foreign operations_ Assets and liabilities in foreign operations, including goodwill and other Group surplus and defi cit values, are translated from the functional currency to the Group’s reporting currency, Swedish kronor, at the exchange rate on balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated at the average rate, which serves as an approximation of the rate that applied on each transaction date. Translation diff erences arise in the translation of subsidiary accounts in part because the balance sheet date rate changes each period and in part because the average rate deviates from balance sheet date rate. Translation diff erences are recognised directly in total comprehensive income as the year’s change in the translation reserve. Long-term receivables and liabilities between the Parent Company and subsidiaries can be seen as an extension or reduction of the net investment in each company. If this is the case, translation diff erences are recognised under other comprehensive income in the consolidated fi nancial statements. When foreign operations are sold, accumulated translation diff erences attributable to those operations are realised. During the year the Group did not hedge any other fl ow exposure pertaining to anticipated receipts or disbursements in foreign currency. Financial assets and liabilities The Group applies IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. A fi nancial instrument is any form of agreement giving rise to a fi nancial asset in a company and a fi nancial liability or equity instrument in a counterparty. Financial instruments recognised in the balance sheet include, on the asset side, cash and bank balances, accounts receivable and other equity instruments, loans receivable, portfolio investments and derivatives. Client funds are recognised on a separate line in the balance sheet and therefore are not included in the Group’s reported liquid assets. Included among liabilities and equity are accounts payable, client funds payable, debt and equity instruments in issue, loan liabilities and derivatives. On initial recognition, fi nancial assets (except accounts receivable with no signifi cant fi nancing component) and fi nancial liabilities are valued at fair value plus (in the case of fi nancial instruments not measured at fair value via the income statement) transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition or issue. Accounts receivable with no signifi cant fi nancing component are valued at the transaction price. On initial recognition, a fi nancial asset is classifi ed as valued at amortised t f i l i th h i i t f i l i th i the Group changes its business model for managing fi nancial assets, in which case all of the fi nancial assets concerned are reclassifi ed from the fi rst day of the reporting period commencing after the change in business model. A fi nancial asset or fi nancial liability is recognised in the balance sheet when the company becomes party to the instrument’s contractual terms. Receivables are recognised when the company has performed and there is a contractual obligation on the counterparty to pay, even if an invoice has not yet been received. Accounts receivable are recognised in the balance sheet when an invoice has been sent. Liabilities are recognised when the counterparty has performed and there is a contractual obligation to pay, even if an invoice has not yet been received. Trade accounts payable are recognised when an invoice is received. A fi nancial asset is removed from the balance sheet when the rights in the agreement are realised, expire or the company loses control over them. A fi nancial liability is removed from the balance sheet when the obligation in the agreement has been discharged or otherwise extinguished. The fair value of listed fi nancial assets corresponds to their listed market price on the balance sheet date. The fair value of unlisted fi nancial assets is determined by using valuation techniques, e.g., recently conducted transactions, the price of similar instruments and discounted cash fl ows. For forward exchange contracts and currency interest rate swaps, fair value is determined based on listed prices. The fair value of forward exchange contracts and currency interest rate swaps is calculated by discounting the difference between the contracted forward rate and the forward rate that can be secured on the balance sheet date for the remaining contract period. The current value is obtained by discounting applying the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. For further information, see Note 34. _Portfolio investments_ Portfolio investments consist of portfolios of delinquent receivables purchased at prices signifi cantly below the nominal receivable. Portfolio investments usually refer to receivables from private individuals and are often unsecured receivables. They are reported in accordance with the rules for acquired impaired (“credit-impaired”) receivables in IFRS 9, that is, at amortised cost applying the eff ective interest method and an eff ective interest rate refl ecting the degree to which the receivable is impaired. The portfolios are attributable to the third stage of credit risk in accordance with the classifi cation in IFRS 9. In the income statement, income from portfolio investments is recognised, in accordance with the eff ective interest rate method, as the collected amount less amortisation. The collection is often performed by the same personnel who handle collections and debt surveillance on behalf of external clients within the Credit Management service line. The cost of collection is debited internally at market price and expensed in the income statement for the Portfolio Investments service line as a cost of services sold. Reporting follows the eff ective interest method, where the carrying value of each portfolio corresponds to the present value of all projected future gross cash fl ows discounted by an initial eff ective interest rate determined on the date the portfolio was acquired. Based on the relation between cost and the projected future gross cash fl ows on the acquisition date. Changes in the carrying value of the portfolios are comprised of amortisation for the period and are recognised in the income statement as a deduction item on the revenue line. In connection with the purchase of each portfolio of receivables, a projection is made of the portfolio’s future gross cash fl ows. Gross cash fl ows include the loan amount, reminder fees, collection fees and late interest that, based on a probability assessment are expected to be received from end ----- tion price including transaction costs as a basis, each portfolio is assigned an initial eff ective interest rate that is then used to discount cash fl ows through the life of the portfolio. Current cash fl ow projections are monitored over the course of the year and updated based on, among other things, achieved collection results, agreements reached with end-customers on instalment plans and macroeconomic information, including forecasts of economic development and unemployment in each country. Cash fl ow projections are made at the portfolio level, since each portfolio of receivables consists of a small number of homogeneous amounts. On the basis of the updated cash fl ow projections and initial eff ective interest rate, a new carrying value for the portfolio is calculated in the closing accounts. The accounting model assumes each portfolio to be relatively homogeneous and comprising a large number of receivables for smaller amounts. Portfolios comprising individual larger receivables are valued on acquisition and at the level of the receivables in ongoing reporting over the lifecycle of the portfolio and not at the portfolio level. Changes over time in the book value can be divided into an anticipated time and interest rate component (amortisation) and a component related to changes in estimates of future cash fl ows (revaluation). The eff ects of changes in cash fl ow forecasts, including changes in the anticipated fi nancial lifetime of the portfolio, are referred to as revaluations and treated symmetrically, i.e., both increases and decreases in forecast fl ows aff ect the portfolios’ book value and, as a result, earnings. This means that certain portfolios may be valued at an amount higher than their cost. Although selling portfolios of purchased debt is not included in the business model, when such sales do occur as an exception, the resulting sales price received for the portfolio is reported in the same way as if it had been recovered from the end-customers. The entire remaining carrying values of the portfolios are recognised as amortisation. Long-term receivables and other receivables Long-term receivables and other receivables are those that arise when the company provides money without the intent to trade its claim. If the anticipated maturity is longer than one year they constitute long-term receivables, and if it is shorter they are other receivables. These receivables are recognised at amortised cost. _Accounts receivable_ Accounts receivable are recognised at the amount expected to be received after deducting impaired receivables, which are determined individually or according to statistical models based on historical experience in each country. Provisions are made for doubtful accounts receivable as the receivables arise, for expected losses, and are, if necessary, adjusted over the term of the claim. The anticipated maturity of accounts receivable is short, so they are carried at amortised cost without discounting. _Legal outlays_ The Group incurs outlays for court fees, legal representation, enforcement authorities, etc., which can be charged to and collected from end-customers. In certain cases Intrum has agreements with its clients where any expenses that cannot be collected from end-customers are instead refunded by the clients. The amount that is expected to be recovered from a solvent counterparty is recognised as an asset in the balance sheet on the line Other receivbl Th ti i t d t it f th i bl i h t th _Client funds_ Client funds, which are reported as assets and liabilities in the balance sheet, represent cash received on collection of a specifi c debt on behalf of a client and payable to the client within a specifi ed period. Client funds are liquid funds with a restricted disposition right. The same amount is reported as a liability. _Cash and cash equivalents_ Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, as well as immediately available balances with banks and similar institutions. Short-term investments consist of investments with an insignifi cant risk of fl uctuating in value, which can easily be converted to cash and have a maturity of not more than three months from acquisition. _Liabilities_ Liabilities are initially recognised at the amount received following deduction of transaction costs. Subsequent to acquisition, loans are carried at amortised cost according to the eff ective rate method. Long-term liabilities have an anticipated remaining maturity of more than one year, while short-term liabilities have a maturity of less than one year. The Group’s long-term loans generally have short fi xed interest periods, which means that the nominal loan amount plus accrued interest is a good approximation of the liability calculated according to the eff ective rate model. _Accounts payable_ Accounts payable are valued at amortised cost. However, accounts payable have a short anticipated maturity and are carried without being discounting to a nominal amount. _Derivative instruments_ Derivatives consist of forward exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and currency interest rate swaps used to reduce interest and exchange rate risks attributable to assets and liabilities in foreign currency. Derivatives are also contractual terms embedded in other agreements. Embedded derivatives are recognised separately if they are not closely related to the host agreement. Forward exchange contracts are classifi ed as fi nancial assets or liabilities recognised at fair value via the income statement (held for trade) and assessed at fair value without deductions for transaction expenses that may arise on sale or similar. Hedge accounting is not needed for forward exchange contracts because the hedged item and the hedging instrument are carried at the price on the balance sheet date with changes in value recognised in the income statement as exchange rate diff erences. Changes in the value of operations-related receivables and liabilities are recognised in operating earnings, while changes in the value of fi nancial receivables and liabilities are recognised in net fi nancial items. Currency interest rate swaps are valued at fair value and reported in the balance sheet together with hedge accounting via Other comprehensive income. Currency interest rate swaps were signed in connection with the Parent Company’s issue of bonds in SEK that were exchanged for EUR to hedge net investments in foreign operations where the loan currency has been used in the operations. The liability in SEK was exchanged into the same liability in EUR on both the starting date and the date of maturity. _Hedge accounting with regard to exchange rate risk in the net investment in foreign subsidiaries_ contracts that are translated on the closing date to the exchange rate then in eff ect. Translation diff erences for the period on fi nancial instruments used to hedge a net investment in a Group company are recognised in the degree the hedge is eff ective in total comprehensive income, while cumulative changes are recognised in equity (translation reserve). As a result, translation diff erences that arise when Group companies are consolidated are neutralised. Property holdings The Group applies IAS 2 Inventories. In connection with acquisitions of portfolio investments and in connection with the recovery of collateral for acquired receivables, Intrum may become owners of property holdings or other physical goods. They have been acquired for the purpose of being divested within the Group’s ongoing operations, and are therefore classifi ed as inventories. These are reported in the balance sheet at cost or net realisable value, whichever is lower. When goods from these inventories are sold, the sales price received is recognised as income and the amount recognised as an inventory asset is reported as an expense in the same period. Intangible fi xed assets _Goodwill_ Goodwill represents the diff erence between the cost of an acquisition and the fair value of the acquired assets, assumed liabilities and contingent liabilities. If the Group’s cost of the acquired shares in a subsidiary exceeds the market value of the subsidiary’s net assets according to the acquisition analysis, the diff erence is recognised as Group goodwill. The goodwill that can arise through business combinations implemented through other than a purchase of shares is recognised in the same way. For business combinations where the cost is less than the net value of acquired assets and assumed and contingent liabilities, the diff erence is recognised directly through profi t or loss. Goodwill is recognised at cost less accumulated impairment. The fair value of goodwill is determined annually for each cash-generating unit in relation to the unit’s performance and anticipated future cash fl ow. If deemed necessary, goodwill is written down on the basis of this evaluation. Intrum’s operations in each geographical region (Northern Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, Western and Southern Europe, as well as the Iberian Peninsula and Latin America) are, in this context, considered to be the Group’s cash-generating units. Goodwill that arises from the acquisition of a company outside Sweden is classifi ed as an asset in the local currency and translated in the accounts at the balance sheet date rate. _Capitalised expenses for IT development_ The Group applies IAS 38 Intangible Assets. Expenditures for IT development and maintenance are generally expensed as incurred. Expenditures for software development that can be attributed to identifi able assets under the Group’s control and with anticipated future economic benefi ts are capitalised and recognised as intangible assets. These capitalised costs include staff costs for the development team and other direct and indirect costs. Borrowing costs are included in the cost of qualifi ed fi xed assets. Additional expenditures for previously developed software, etc. are recognised as an asset in the balance sheet if they increase the future economic benefi ts of the specifi c asset to which they are attributable, e.g., by improving t di t ’ f ti lit b d it i i l ----- IT development costs that are recognised as intangible assets are amortised using the straight-line method over their useful lives (3–5 years). Useful life is reassessed annually. The asset is recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Costs associated with the maintenance of existing computer software are expensed as they are incurred. _Client relationships_ Client relationships that are recognised as fi xed assets relate to fair value revaluations recognised upon acquisition in accordance with IFRS 3. They are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life (5–10 years). Useful life is reassessed annually. The asset is recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. _Other intangible fi xed assets_ Other intangible fi xed assets relate to other acquired rights are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life (3–5 years). Useful life is reassessed annually. The asset is recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Tangible fi xed assets The Group applies IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 40 Investment Property. Tangible fi xed assets are recognised at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes the purchase price and costs directly attributable to putting the asset into place and condition to be utilised in the way intended. Examples of directly attributable costs are delivery and handling, installation, consulting services and legal services. Depreciation is booked on a straight-line basis over the asset’s anticipated useful life (3–5 years). Useful life is reassessed annually. Investment properties are properties that have been acquired to be leased to others or used within the Group’s operations rather than being sold. They are reported in accordance with the cost method, applying depreciation over the estimated useful life of the buildings. Additional expenses are capitalised only to the extent that they increase value in relation to performance on the date on which the property was acquired. No depreciation is applied for land. The carrying value of a tangible fi xed asset is excluded from the balance sheet when the asset is sold or disposed of or when no economic benefi ts are expected from its use or disposal of the asset. The gain or loss that arises on the sale or disposal of an asset is comprised of the diff erence between the sales price and the asset’s carrying value less direct costs to sell. Gains and losses are recognised as other operating earnings. An annual determination is made of each asset’s residual value and useful life. Tangible fi xed assets are recognised as an asset in the balance sheet if it is likely that the future economic benefi ts will accrue to the company and the cost of the asset can be reliably estimated. Leasing The Group applies IFRS 16 Leases. IFRS 16 stipulates that for both fi nancial and operational leases of significance, a right-of-use asset and a lease liability are to be recognised. The exception is short-term leases, of 12 months or less, and lease agreements f l l f hi h l f d i h li lease payments for the entire lease period (including any extensions, if it is deemed reasonably certain, when signing the contract, that these will be used) discounted at the marginal loan rate. Minimum lease payments include fi xed fees after deductions for any benefi ts in connection with the signing of the lease and amounts expected to be paid by the lessee according to the residual value guarantee. When the lease liability has been determined, the right-of-use asset is reported at the same value as the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is recognised with linear amortisation over the term of the contract. The lease liability is recognised including interest expenses in accordance with the eff ective interest rate method. The lease liability is reassessed, and the right-of-use asset correspondingly adjusted, if the term of the lease changes, the lease payments change due to index adjustments or if additions are made to an existing lease that are not reported as a separate contract. Taxes The Group applies IAS 12 Income Taxes. Income taxes consist of current tax and deferred tax. Income taxes are recognised in the income statement unless the underlying transaction is recognised directly in other total comprehensive income, in which case the related tax eff ect is recognised in other total comprehensive income. Current tax is tax that is to be paid or received during the year in question applying the tax rates applicable on the balance sheet date; which includes adjustment of current tax attributable to previous periods. Deferred tax is calculated according to the balance sheet method based on temporary diff erences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their value for tax purposes. The following temporary diff erences are not taken into account: temporary diff erences that arise in the initial reporting of goodwill, the initial reporting of assets and liabilities in a transaction other than a business combination and which, at the time of the transaction, do not aff ect either the recognised or taxable result, or temporary diff erences attributable to participations in subsidiaries and associated companies that are not expected to be reversed within the foreseeable future. The valuation of deferred tax is based on how the carrying values of assets or liabilities are expected to be realised or settled. Deferred tax is calculated by applying the tax rates and tax rules that have been set or essentially are set as of the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets from deductible temporary diff erences and tax-loss carryforwards are only recognised if it is likely they will be utilised within the foreseeable future. The value of deferred tax assets is reduced when it is no longer considered likely they can be utilised. Shareholders’ equity Share repurchases and transaction expenses are recognised directly against equity. Dividends are recognised as a liability after they are approved by the Annual General Meeting. Provisions The Group applies IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets. A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or informal obligation owing to an event that has occurred and it is likely that an outfl ow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. The carrying amount for the provision is based on an assessment of the most likely outcome, and can be call t d b i hi th i ibl t d lti l i thi b made, provisions are estimated by discounting the forecast future cash fl ow at a pre-tax interest rate that refl ects current market estimates of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks associated with the liability. A provision for restructuring is recognised when a detailed, formal restructuring plan has been established and the restructuring has either begun or been publicly announced. No provision is made for future operating expenses. A provision for termination costs is recognised only if the persons in question have known or presumed to have expected to be terminated by the balance sheet date. A provision is recognised for a loss-making contract when anticipated benefi ts that the Group expects to receive from a contract are less than the unavoidable costs to fulfi l the obligations as set out in the contract. A provision for dilapidation agreements on leased premises is recognised if there is a contractual obligation to the landlord, within the foreseeable future, to restore the premises to a certain condition when the lease expires. Unidentifi ed receipts and excess payments The Group receives large volumes of payments from end-customers for itself and its clients. There are instances where the sender’s reference information is missing or incorrect, which makes it diffi cult to allocate the payment to the right case. There are also situations where payments are received on closed cases. In such instances a reasonable search and attempt is made to contact the payment sender but, failing this, the payment is recognised as income after a certain interval. A provision is recognised in the balance sheet corresponding to the anticipated repayments of incorrectly received payments on a probability analysis. Contingent liabilities A contingent liability is recognised when there is a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confi rmed only by one or more uncertain future events or when there is an obligation that is not recognised as a liability or provision because it is not probable that an outfl ow of resources will be required. Impairment The Group applies IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. The carrying value of the Group’s assets, with certain exceptions, is tested on each balance sheet date for any indication of impairment. IAS 36 is applied in the impairment testing of all assets except fi nancial assets, which are valued in accordance with IAS 9, investment assets for pension liabilities, which are valued in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefi ts, and tax assets, which are valued in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes. If there is any indication of impairment, the asset’s recoverable value is estimated. For goodwill and other intangible assets with an indeterminate useful life and intangible assets not yet brought into use, recoverable values are calculated annually. If essentially independent cash fl ows cannot be isolated for individual assets, the assets are grouped at the lowest level where essentially independent cash fl ows can be identifi ed, i.e., a cash-generating unit. Intrum’s operations in each geographical region are considered to be the Group’s cash-generating units in this regard. Impairment is recognised when the carrying value of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable value. Impairment is recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses attributable to a cash-generating unit are mainly allocated to goodwill, after which they are divided proportionately th t i th it ----- value less costs to sell and value in use. Value in use is measured by discounting future cash fl ows using a discounting factor that takes into account the risk-free rate of interest and the risk associated with the specifi c asset. Impairment of goodwill is not reversed. Impairment of other assets is reversed if a change has been made in the assumptions that served as the basis for determining the recoverable amount. Impairment is reversed only to the extent the carrying value of the assets following the reversal does not exceed the carrying value that the asset would have had if the impairment had not been recognised Employee benefi ts The Group applies IAS 19 Employee Benefi ts. _Pension obligations_ The Group’s pension obligations are, for the most part, secured through offi cial pension arrangements or insurance solutions. Pension obligations vary between countries on the basis of legislation and diff erent pension systems. See also Note 21 for a further description. Defi ned contribution pension plans are plans where the company’s obligation is limited to the fees it has committed to pay. The size of the employee’s pension depends in part on the fees the company pays to an insurance company and in part on the return generated and actuarial factors. Consequently, it is the employee who assumes the investment risk and actuarial risk. The company’s obligations for defi ned contribution pension plans are expensed through the income statement as they are vested by employees who render services on behalf of the company. For defi ned benefi t pension plans, the pension obligation does not cease until the agreed pensions have been paid. The Group’s net obligation for defi ned benefi t pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating future compensation the employees has earned in current and previous periods; this compensation is discounted to its present value. The discount rate is the interest rate as per the balance sheet date on high-quality corporate bonds, including covered bonds, with a maturity that, if possible, corresponds to the Group’s pension obligations. The calculation is performed by an actuary using the so-called Projected Unit Credit Method. The fair value of Intrum’s share of any investment assets as of the balance sheet date is calculated as well. Actuarial gains and losses may arise in the determination of the present value of the obligation and the fair value of investment assets. They arise either because the actual outcome deviates from previous assumptions or the assumptions change. All changes in value associated with such changes in assumptions are recognised in other comprehensive income. The balance sheet value of pensions and similar obligations is therefore equivalent to the present value on the balance sheet date less the fair value of assets under management. Pension costs for service in the current period are reported in the operating earnings, while the calculated interest expense on the pension liability and the interest income from assets under management are reported in net fi nancial items. Pension obligations in Sweden that are met through pension insurance premiums to Alecta in the so-called ITP 2 plan are reported as defi ned contribution pension solutions. Borrowing costs The Group applies IAS 23 Borrowing Costs and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. C t t b k fi i ti d th t f th l eff ective interest method. The amount is recognised in the balance sheet as a deduction to the loan liability. The Group capitalises borrowing costs in the cost of qualifying assets, that is, fi xed assets for substantial amounts with long periods of completion. No such investments were initiated in 2018 or 2019. Revenue recognition The Group applies IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Revenue, consisting of commissions and collection fees, is recognised on collection of the claim. Subscription revenue is recognised proportionately over the term of the underlying service contracts, which is usually one year. Revenue from other services is reported when the service has been performed. Income from property sales is reported when the buyer gains access to the property. Financial income and expenses Financial income and expenses consist of interest income on bank balances and receivables and interest-bearing securities, bank fees, interest expenses on loans, dividend income, exchange rate diff erences, realised and unrealised gains on fi nancial investments, and derivatives used in fi nancial operations. Payment guarantees Intrum off ers some of the Group’s clients the opportunity, against payment, to obtain a guarantee from Intrum regarding the clients’ receivables from their customers. The guarantee entails an undertaking by Intrum to acquire the receivable from the creditor at its nominal value, or a certain part thereof, once it has fallen overdue for payment by a certain number of days. The income, in the form of a guarantee fee, is recognised when the guarantees are issued, while a liability is recognised in the balance sheet for expected losses related to those guarantees. If the debtor fails to make payment, Intrum acquires the claim. The disbursement is then recognised as portfolio investments, less the liability recognised when the guarantee was issued. Cash fl ow statement The Group applies IAS 7 Cash Flow Statements. The cash fl ow statement includes changes in the balance of liquid assets. The Group’s liquid assets consist of cash and bank balances. Cash fl ow is divided into cash fl ows from operating activities, investing activities and fi nancing activities. Cash fl ow from investing activities includes only actual disbursements for investments during the year. Disbursements for the purchase of portfolios of overdue receivables are reported under cash fl ow from investing activities, while the collection and repayment of such portfolios are reported under cash fl ow from operating activities. Foreign subsidiaries’ transactions are translated in the cash fl ow statement at the average exchange rate for the period. Acquired and divested subsidiaries are recognised as cash fl ow from investing activities, net, after deducting liquid assets in the acquired or divested company. Earnings per share The Group applies IAS 33 Earnings per Share. Earnings per share consist of net earnings for the year (attributable to the Parent Company’s shareholders) divided by a weighted average number of sury shares that may be reissued in the future to fulfi l commitments under the incentive programme for company management, no dilution eff ect is calculated until the vesting requirements of the incentive programme have been met. Segments The Group applies IFRS 8 Operating Segments. An operating segment is a part of the Group from which it can generate income and incur expenses and for which separate fi nancial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, i.e. the CEO in deciding how to assess performance and allocate resources to the operating segment. As of 1 January 2020, Intrum’s operating segments are: Credit Management Services (CMS), Portfolio Investments (PI) and Strategic Markets (Greece, Italy, Spain and Brazil). The break-down by the aforementioned operating segments is also used for internal monitoring in the Group. Among other things, Note 2 details net revenue and operating earnings by operating segment. However, interest income, interest expenses, assets and liabilities are not reported by segment. This is not considered relevant because the distribution of fi nancial items and parts of the balance sheet is dependent on Group structure and fi nancing, which are not aff ected by the actual performance of the regions. Nor are actual reported interest income, interest expenses, assets and liabilities by segment included in any internal reporting to the CEO. Parent Company’s accounting principles The Parent Company has prepared the Annual Report according to the Annual Accounts Act (1995:1554) and recommendation RFR 2 Accounting for Legal Entities from the Swedish Financial Reporting Board. RFR 2 means that the Parent Company, in the annual report for the legal entity, must apply all EU-approved IFRS and statements as far as possible within the framework of the Annual Accounts Act and taking into account the connection between reporting and taxation. The recommendation specifi es exemptions and additions relative to IFRS. As of 2019, Intrum has made a new interpretation of the rules in RFR 2 Accounting legal entities, entailing the Parent Company’s exchange rate differences attributable to the hedging of the Group’s exchange rate risk in foreign operations no longer being reported under Other comprehensive income but under Net fi nancial items in the Parent Company’s income statement. The amended interpretation with regard to the Parent Company’s accounting has no impact on the consolidated fi nancial statements. _Diff erences between the Group’s and Parent Company’s accounting principles_ The diff erences between the Group’s and Parent Company’s accounting principles are indicated below. The accounting principles for the Parent Company as stated below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the Parent Company’s fi nancial statements. _Subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures_ Shares in subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures are recognised by the Parent Company at cost, including transaction costs less any impairment. Only dividends received are recognised as income. Credit risks in the Parent Company’s receivables from subsidiaries have been considd h i i ifi d f i i ----- _Group contributions and shareholders’ contributions for legal entities_ The company reports Group contributions and shareholders’ contributions in accordance with statement RFR 2 of the Swedish Financial Reporting Board. Group contributions received are recognised as dividends and Group contributions paid are recognised as shareholders’ contributions. Shareholders’ contributions are recognised directly in the shareholders’ equity of the recipient and capitalised in the shares and participating interests of the contributor, to the extent impairment is not required. _Other_ The accounting rules for leasing in accordance with IFRS 16 that are applied in the consolidated accounts are also applied in the Parent Company’s accounts. Note 2 Critical estimates and assumptions To be able to prepare the accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices, company management and the Board of Directors must make assessments and assumptions that aff ect reported income and expense items, asset and liability items, as well as other disclosures. Management has discussed with the Audit Committee the Group’s critical accounting principles and estimates as well as the application of these Estimates and assumptions are continuously assessed on the basis of historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events considered reasonable under prevailing conditions. Actual outcomes may vary from the assessments made. The areas in which estimates and assumptions could entail signifi cant risk of adjustment in the recognised amounts for assets and liabilities in future fi scal years are primarily the following: Impairment testing of goodwill (Notes 1 and 11) As indicated in Note 11, an impairment test of goodwill was performed prior to the preparation of the annual accounts. The segments are judged to achieve a suffi cient degree of integration that they form combined cash generating units and are deemd to met the defi nition. Recoverable amounts for cash generating units have been established by calculating their value in use. The assumptions and assessments made with regard to expected cash fl ows and discount rates in the form of weighted average cost of capital, as well as a sensitivity analysis are detailed in Note 11. Projections of future cash fl ows are based on the best possible assessments of future income and operating expenses. Portfolio investments As indicated in Note 15, the recognition of portfolio investments in overdue receivables is based on the company’s own projection of future cash fl ows from the acquired portfolios. Although the company has historically had good projection accuracy with regard to cash fl ows, future deviations cannot be ruled out. The Group applies internal rules and a formalised decision-making process in the adjustment of previously established cash fl ow projections. These entail, among other things, that cash fl ow projections are only in exceptional cases adjusted in the fi rst year of ownership of a portfolio. Furthermore, an amendment of the cash fl ow projection normally requires an agreement between local management in the country in question and the Group’s risk department. All changes in cash fl ow projections are ultimately decided on by a central revaluation committee. On a few occasions, the Group has sold portfolios of purchased debt. Divestments of portfolios are not included in the business model for this asset category. Intrum has assessed the transactions and concluded that a sale of purchased debt should be recognised in the same way as if an amount equivalent to the selling price had been collected as part of normal operations. For Intrum’s accounting, it does not matter if the same amount is received through collection from debtors or by sale to an external party. The entire sale price for the portfolios sold has been reported as the amount collected on purchased debt, and the entire carrying value remaining prior to the sale has been reported as amortisation of purchased debt. Useful lifetimes of intangible and tangible fi xed assets Group Management establishes assessed useful lifetimes and thus consistent amortisation and depreciation for the Group’s intangible and tangible fi xed assets. These estimates are based on historical knowledge of equivalent assets’ useful lives. Useful life and estimated residual values are tested on each balance sheet date and adjusted when necessary. Recognised values for each balance sheet date for intangible and tangible fi xed assets, see Notes 11 and 12. Assessment of deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets for tax-loss carryforwards or other future tax deductions are recognised to the extent it is deemed likely that the deduction can be made against future taxable surpluses. Carrying amounts for deferred tax assets on each balance sheet date are provided in Note 9. Accounting of Polish investment funds The Group has operated in Poland since 2006 through investment funds designed for the purchasing and holding of portfolio investments. From the Group’s perspective, the funds function in practice as a subsidiary. Against this backdrop, in the consolidated fi nancial statements, Intrum consolidates the investment funds as a subsidiary. Joint venture As stated in Note 14, the Intrum Group has, since 2018, invested in profi t participating notes issued by the Irish company Ithaca Investment DAC. Through its holding in the profi t participating notes and the wording of the agreement, Intrum holds a position closely corresponding to that of a shareholder in the company, and the consolidated accounts therefore treat the profi t participating notes as though they were an equity instrument issued by Ithaca Investment DAC. Although Intrum’s holding corresponds to 80 per cent of the profi t participating notes issued shareholder loans, through an agreement with another investor holding 20 per cent of the profi t participating notes, the two parties share a controlling infl uence, and Intrum therefore reports the investment according to the rules for joint ventures. Provisions for restructuring As shown in Notes 4, 24 and 26, in 2019 and 2020, Intrum made provisions for future expenses, mainly for restructuring. These provisions have been made in accordance with the rules in IAS 37 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets. Among other things, these rules entail provisions only being made when Intrum has an existing liability or obligation as a result of events that have occurred. For restructuring, this only applies when a formal detailed plan has been drawn up and communicated to those concerned in suffi cient detail that they have known or can be expected to have anticipated, by the balance sheet date, the termination of their employment. Also under other circumstances, provisions are made and costs expensed only when Intrum has an existing liability in the form of a legal or informal obligation to pay, by the balance sheet date, for goods or services received. The Corona pandemic The corona pandemic impacted the entire world during 2020 and Intrum was no exception. On 25 March 2020, Intrum stated that the eff ects of Covid19 were expected to vary between markets and businesses. Management described how external events associated with the spread of Covid-19 were expected to aff ect the Group’s productivity and earnings negatively for a period. Intrum communicated, at that time, its intention to reduce the pace of its investments and to raise its yield requirements on new portfolio investments. Over the year, management monitored developments continuously and acted when necessary, updating forecasts and continuously describing the eff ects. Due to the Group’s geographical spread and product diversifi cation and to payments largely occurring through automatic and online channels, Intrum had stable cash fl ows during 2020. As planned, new fi nancial targets were communicated in connection with the capital markets day held in November. ----- Applied segments are Credit management services, Strategic markets and Portfolio investments. Central and joint expenses are spread across the segments in proportion to their purchasing power parity-adjusted revenues. The break-down by segments is also used for internal monitoring in the Group. Intra-Group sales between the regions are made on commercial terms. Internal transactions between the Portfolio Investments and Credit Management service lines relate to payment on commercial terms for work carried out within Credit Management regarding handling and collection of the Group’s purchased debt. Payment is made in the form of a commission that is recognised as a cost within purchased debt, but which is eliminated in the Consolidated Income Statement. For 2020, revenues from an individual customer in the Strategic Markets segment corresponded to approximately 10% of the Group’s net revenues. Interest income and expenses reported in net fi nancial items are not reported by segment. This is not considered relevant because the distribution of fi nancial items is dependent on Group structure and fi nancing and is not aff ected by the actual performance of the segments.

Other fi nancial expenses include SEK –87 M ( –252 ) in expenses for premature redemption of bonds and credit facility. The Parent Company’s interest expenses include interest expenses to Group companies of SEK -101 (-128) M. Note 9 Taxes The tax expense for the year breaks down as follows: Group SEK M 2020 2019 Current tax Tax expense attributable to net earnings for the year –957 –594 Tax attributable to previous years –847 –6 Total current tax –1,804 –600 Deferred tax Deferred tax related to temporary diff erences 1,162 –200 Deferred tax expense attributable to net of previously 87 375 capitalised and non-capitalised tax value in tax-loss carryforwards Total deferred tax 1,249 176 Total tax expense –555 –424 No tax is recognised for capital gains. The Group has operations in more than 20 countries in Europe, with various tax rates. The current tax expense for the year relates mainly to income taxes in Switzerland, Sweden, Germany, Greece Spain, Finland and the Netherlands. The Group’s Swedish companies paid no income tax for the year as they were able to utilise tax-loss carry forwards from historic losses. Current tax in 2020 is impacted by a change in timing of recognition of taxable revenue on portfolios owned by a subsidiary in Switzerland. The taxable profi t is now based on accounting principles similar to IFRS where the amortisation period for portfolios is longer than in accordance with the local accounting principles applied for earlier periods. The subsidiary was previously defi ned as a low taxed entity for which CFC taxation was applied in Sweden, therefore the local income was included in the Swedish income tax returns and taxes paid in Switzerland on the same revenue credited in Swedish tax. The accumulated eff ect of this change for previous years on current tax in 2020 is SEK 840 M whereof SEK 535 M was paid in Switzerland in 2020 and net SEK 305 M is due in Sweden in 2021. A corresponding reversal of deferred tax liabilities has off set this eff ect as the group provided for deferred tax on the temporary diff erence between accounting and tax value of the portfolios. Intrum AB is seated in Sweden where the nominal corporate tax rate in 2019 and 2020 was 21.4 percent, and 20.6 percent from the year starting 1 January 2021.

Deferred tax assets are reported in the balance sheet, when it is expected to be possible to off set the loss carry forwards against taxable profi ts within the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reported net if they relate to the same tax authority or are planned to be utilised simultaneously. The Group has loss carry forwards that can be utilised against future taxable earnings totalling SEK 3,200 M (SEK 5,952 M). Recognised deferred tax assets related to loss carry forwards amounted to SEK 646 M at 31 December 2020 and include SEK 403 M in Sweden, SEK 103 M in Norway, SEK 81 M in Spain, SEK 32 M in Hungary, SEK 13 M in the Netherlands, SEK 2 M in Poland and SEK 1 M in Greece. Interest and tax-loss carry forwards for which no deferred tax assets are reported are SEK 2,619 M of which SEK 2,245 M in Sweden, SEK 268 M in the UK, SEK 56 M in Poland and SEK 50 M in Denmark. Tax expenses reported in other comprehensive income during the year amounted to SEK -208 M (SEK 174 M), of which SEK -209 M pertained to currency hedging and SEK 1 M pertained to revaluations of pension provisions.

Utilised previously unrecognised tax assets pertaining to tax-loss carry forwards relate to the positive tax eff ect over the year arising from the utilisation of tax-loss carry forwards not previously recognised as deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities When diff erences arise between the tax value and carrying value of assets and liabilities, a deferred tax asset or tax liability is recognised. Such temporary diff erences mainly arise for portfolio investments, provisions for pensions and intangible assets. Deferred tax assets include the value of tax-loss carry forwards in the instances where they are likely to be utilised to off set taxable surpluses within the foreseeable future Net earnings for the year attributable to Parent Company’s shareholders, discontinued operations (SEK M) – – ----- Note 11 Intangible fi xed assets 2020** Group Parent Capitalised Capitalised expenditure for Customer Other intangible expenditure for Other intangible SEK M Goodwill[1] IT development relationships fi xed assets Total IT development fi xed assets Total Acquisition cost, opening balance 36,058 2,349 8,426 517 47,351 206 19 225 Acquisitions and capitalisations for the year 5 340 6 1 352 184 1 185 Disposals - -77 -25 -102 -204 - - 0 Adjustment PPA -4 - - - -4 - - 0 Reclassifi cation 0 1 1 0 1 - - 0 Translation diff erences -1,709 -95 -346 -18 -2,168 - - 0 Accumulated acquisition cost, closing balance 34,550 2,518 8,061 398 45,328 391 20 410 Amortisation, opening balance - -1,378 -2 347 -322 -4,046 -66 -3 -69 Amortisation for the year - -224 -934 -28 -1,186 -22 -6 -28 Disposals - 71 25 101 197 - - 0 Reclassifi cation - -1 -3 2 -2 - - 0 Translation diff erences - 76 134 12 221 - - 0 Accumulated amortisation, closing balance - -1,455 -3,125 -235 -4,816 -88 -8 -96 Impairments, opening balance -2 700 -361 - -4 -3,065 -16 - -16 Translation diff erences - - - - - - - 0 Accumulated impairment, closing balance -2 700 -361 - -4 -3,065 -16 0 -16 Net book value, closing balance 31,650 702 4,936 159 37,447 286 12 298 2019** Group Parent Capitalised Capitalised expenditure for Customer Other intangible expenditure for Other intangible SEK M Goodwill[1] IT development relationships fi xed assets Total IT development fi xed assets Total Acquisition cost, opening balance 33,055 1,658 5,209 379 40,301 67 3 70 Acquisitions and capitalisations for the year 2,414 332 90 15 2,851 139 16 155 Adjustment PPA - -95 0 -16 -111 - - 0 Reclassifi cation -165 171 175 -42 139 - - 0 Purchased via acquisition - 256 2,896 170 3,322 - - 0 Translation diff erences 754 28 56 11 849 - - 0 Accumulated acquisition cost, closing balance 36,058 2,349 8,426 517 47,351 206 19 225 Amortisation, opening balance - -1,241 -1,539 -312 **-3,092** -10 - -10 Amortisation for the year - -82 -780 -64 -926 -56 -2 -58 Disposals - 95 - 24 119 - - 0 Reclassifi cation - -171 -10 42 -139 - - 0 Translation diff erences - 21 -18 -11 -8 - Accumulated amortisation, closing balance - -1,378 -2,347 -322 -4,046 -66 -2 -68 Impairments, opening balance - -23 - -4 -27 -16 - 0 Impairments for the year -2,700 -338 - - -3,038 - - 0 Translation diff erences - - - - 0 -16 0 -16 Accumulated impairment, closing balance -2,700 -361 -192 -4 -3,065 -16 0 0 ----- Goodwill per cash generating unit (CGU) Change during Thereof exchange MSEK 31 dec 2019 1 jan 2020 31 dec 2020 the year rate diff rences Northern Europe 12,545 - - - Central & Eastern Europe 7,005 - - - Western & Southern Europe 6,249 - - - Iberian Peninsula & Latin America 7,559 - - - Strategic Markets - 10,272 9,808 -464 -461 Credit Management Services - 23,085 21,842 -1,243 -1,247 Total 33,358 33,358 31,650 -1,707 -1,708 During 2020 Intrum has updated its impairment model to be in line with the new segment structure described in the note 1. The goodwill that was previously distributed to the geographical regions has been redistributed to the operating segments Credit Management Services and Strategic Markets, which also as an individual constitute separate cash-generating units. Impairment testing of goodwill for each cash-generating unit was done prior to preparation of the annual accounts. The recoverable amount is determined through an estimation of its value in use. For each cash-generating unit, management has compiled a projection of annual future cash fl ows based on historical experience and the Company’s own plans and estimates for the future. The calculation is generally based on a detailed forecast for the years 2021–2025 and thereafter an extrapolation during the period 2026– 2027 with a growth rate slightly exceeding the annual increase until the forecast reaches a perpetual growth rate of equilibrium of 1.5 percent, which is forecast from 2028annual increase of 1.5 percent. The cash fl ows have been discounted to present value applying the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, which is estimated at 6.0 percent (6.0) per year before tax, corresponding to 4.7 percent (4.2) per year after tax. The recoverable amount has been compared for each unit with the Group’s net book value of the unit’s assets and liabilities. Impairment testing is based on a number of assumptions, where the outcome is judged to be most sensitive to some of those assumptions in particular: For 2021 the revenue growth of Mature and emerging markets is predicted 2.0% and for Strategic markets 5.2%, which is then gradually expected to increase until the year 2024. This higher growth rate forecast for 2024 is expected to continue during 2025 and then gradually decrease and from 2028 onwards extrapolated with a growth rate of 1.5 percent annually is assumed. Most of the assumptions were applied for all CGU. The same discount rates were also applied, since no signifi cant long-term diff erence can be identifi ed between the regions’ growth potential or risk. During the year, the Group wrote down goodwill by SEK 0 M (2,700). For 2019, reported goodwill was distributed to the then cash-generating units in Intrum’s operating segments, i.e. the credit management operations within the respective geographical regions of Northern Europe (Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Norway and Sweden), Central and Eastern Europe (Greece, Poland, Romania, Switzerland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary and Austria), Western and Southern Europe (Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK), as well as the Iberian Peninsula and Latin America (Spain, Portugal and Brazil. For the impairment test in 2019, a detailed forecast period of three years was applied and where cash fl ows beyond the three-year period were extrapolated with an estimated growth rate of 1 percent. Further information on the assumptions for 2019 can be found in Note 10 “Intangible assets” in the annual report for 2019. In total, goodwill was written down in 2019 to the then region of the Iberian Peninsula and Latin America corresponding to SEK 2,700 million as a consequence of the challenges in Spain and the lower level of earnings noted in the impairment test in 2019 compared with previous periods with other market conditions. Sensitivity analysis A sensitivity analysis has been performed in 2020, in which cash fl ows have beendiscounted at 7.2 percent interest after tax. With this assumption, it was still not necessary to impair goodwill attributable to any of the CGU’s. ----- Note 12 Tangible fi xed assets 2020** Group Parent SEK M Property investments Computer hardware Other equipment Total Computer hardware Other equipment Total Acquisition cost, opening balance - 301 590 891 15 - 15 Acquisitions and capitalisations for the year - 27 63 89 4 - 4 Disposals - -119 -62 -181 - - 0 Reclassifi cation - 4 1 5 - - 0 Purchased via acquisition 2 - - 2 - - 0 Translation diff erences -10 -29 -38 - - 0 Accumulated acquisition cost, closing balance 2 203 563 768 19 19 Depreciation, opening balance - -247 -432 -679 -3 - -3 Depreciation for the year - -25 -55 -80 -3 - -3 Disposals - 119 62 181 - - 0 Reclassifi cation - -4 -2 -6 - - 0 Translation diff erences - 8 20 27 - - 0 Accumulated depreciation, closing balance -150 -407 -557 -6 - -6 Net book value, closing balance 2 53 156 211 13 - 13 2019** Group Parent SEK M Property investments Computer hardware Other equipment Total Computer hardware Other equipment Total Acquisition cost, opening balance 256 328 594 1,178 6 - 6 Acquisitions and capitalisations for the year - 42 48 90 9 - 9 Disposals -256 -78 -75 -409 - - 0 Reclassifi cation - 3 -8 -5 - - 0 Purchased via acquisition - - 21 21 - - 0 Translation diff erences - 6 10 16 - - 0 Accumulated acquisition cost, closing balance 0 301 590 891 15 - 15 Depreciation, opening balance - -272 -413 -685 -1 - -1 Depreciation for the year - -31 -53 -84 -2 - -2 Disposals - 63 55 118 - - 0 Reclassifi cation - -2 2 0 - - 0 Purchased via acquisition - - -15 -15 - - 0 Translation diff erences - -5 -8 -13 - - 0 Accumulated depreciation, closing balance - -247 -432 -679 -3 - -3 Net book value, closing balance 0 53 159 212 13 - 13 Disbursements during the year regarding investments in tangible fi xed assets for the Group amounted to SEK 338 M (452) ----- Share of Registration number Domicile capital _Greece_ Intrum Investments Greece A.E 144794101000 Athens 100% Intrum Customer Services Athens 157487101000 Athens 100% Single Member Societe Anonyme _Latvia_ SIA Intrum Global Technologies 40103314641 Riga 100% _Netherlands_ Intrum BV 33273472 Amsterdam 100% Intrum Justitia Data Centre BV 27306188 Amsterdam 100% _Norway_ Lock TopCo AS 913 852 508 Oslo 100% _Poland_ Intrum Spzoo 0000108357 Warsaw 100% Intrum K & WKP SK 0000270515 Wroclaw 99% _Portugal_ Intrum Portugal Unipessoal Lda. 503 933 180 Lisbon 100% Intrum Real Estate Management 514 167 041 Lisbon 100% Portugal SA _Romania_ Intrum Romania SA 18496757 Bucharest 100% Intrum Financial IFN SA 39041618 Bucharest 100% Intrum Customer Services 43497621 Bucharest 100% Bucharest SRL _Spain_ Intrum Justitia Ibérica S.A.U.

Accordingly, the number of shares outstanding at the end of 2019 was 130,941,320 and, at the end of 2020, there were 120,870,918 shares. The average number of shares outstanding over the year was 123,913,717 (131,065,782). Other shareholders’ equity in the Group _Other paid-in capital_ Refers to equity other than share capital contributed by the owners or arising owing to the Group’s shared-based payment programmes. Also included are share premiums paid in connection with new issues. _Reserves_ ences that have, since the transition to IFRS in 2004, arisen in the translation of fi nancial statements from foreign operations as well as long-term intraGroup receivables and liabilities that represent an increase or decrease in the Group’s net investment in the foreign operations. The amount also includes exchange rate diff erences arising in the Parent Company’s external loans in foreign currency, which are intended to hedge the Group’s translation exposure attributable to net assets in foreign subsidiaries. _Retained earnings including net earnings for the year_ Refer to earnings in the Parent Company and subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated companies. Provisions to the statutory reserve, excluding transferred share premium reserves, were previously included in this item. Accumulated revaluations of the Group’s defi ned benefi t pension provisions are also included. Dividends paid and share repurchases are deducted from the amount. Following the balance sheet date, the Board of Directors proposed a dividend of SEK 12 per share (11), or a total estimated payout of SEK 1,450 M (1.332). Other shareholders’ equity in the Parent Company _Statutory reserve_ Refers to provisions to the statutory reserve and share premium reserve prior to 2006. The statutory reserve is restricted equity and may not be reduced through distributions of earnings. _Share premium reserve_ When shares are issued at a premium, the amount exceeding their quota value is transferred to the share premium reserve. Provisions to the share premium reserve as of 2006 are non-restricted equity. _Fair value reserve_ Refers to unrealised exchange rate gains or losses on external loans in foreign currency, which are intended to hedge the Group’s translation exposure attributable to net assets in foreign subsidiaries. The fair value reserve is non-restricted equity. _Earnings brought forward_ Refer to retained earnings from the previous year less the dividend paid and share repurchases. Retained earnings are non-restricted equity. _Capital structure_ The company’s defi nition of capital corresponds to shareholders’ equity including holdings without a controlling interest, which at year-end totalled SEK 21,963 M (24,893). The measure of the company’s capital structure used for control purposes is consolidated net debt in relation to pro forma rolling 12-month-adjusted cash EBITDA, which at year-end amounted to 4.0x. This ratio is calculated by placing current consolidated net debt at the end of the year in relation to pro forma cash EBITDA, including operations being phased out and including a calculated cash EBITDA throughout the period for larger units acquired during the year, and excluding non-recurring items (NRIs). Net debt is defi ned as the sum of interest-bearing liabilities and pension provisions less liquid funds and interest-bearing receivables. The Board of Directors has established fi nancial targets for the Group, in ----- Funded defi ned benefi t pension plans For Group employees in Switzerland, commitments exist in the form of obligatory service pension plans funded through insurance policies in the Swiss Life Collective BVG Foundation and in Transparenta BVG Foundation. The funded commitments currently amount to SEK 324 M (335), and the fair value of the assets under management is SEK 234 M (240). Consequently, the net pension liability is SEK 91 M (94). The pension commitment is funded through insurance contracts. During the year Intrum paid SEK 26 M (41) to the plan, while disbursements to retirees amounted to SEK 41 M (56). For these pension plans, a discount rate of 0.80 per cent is applied. An increase/decrease in the discount rate by 0.5 percentage points would entail the pension liability decreasing by 8 per cent/increasing by 9 per cent. For Group employees in Norway, mandatory occupational pensions commitments exist that were previously secured through a funded defi ned benefi t pension solution, although these were replaced in 2019 by an unfunded defi ned benefi t solution and a defi ned contribution solution. ITP 2 plan The commitments for retirement and family pensions for the Group’s Swedish employees are secured through insurance with Alecta according to the so-called ITP 1 and ITP 2 plans. ITP 1 includes employees born in 1979 or later, while ITP 2 covers employees born in 1978 or earlier. ITP 1 is a defi ned contribution plan. On the other hand, according to a statement from the Swedish Financial Reporting Board, UFR 10, the ITP 2 plan is a multi-employer defi ned benefi t plan. Alecta’s customers have not had access to such information for the fi scal year that would make allow them to report their proportional share of plan assets, liabilities and costs, preventing it from being possible to report the plan as a defi ned benefi t plan. Nor is there a contractual agreement how surpluses and defi cits in the plan are to be distributed among plan participants. The ITP 2 plan secured through insurance with Alecta is therefore reported by Intrum as if it were a defi ned contribution plan. The premium is individually calculated, depending on salary, previously vested pension and anticipated remaining term of employment. At year-end Alecta’s surplus in the form of the collective funding ratio was 148 per cent (142). The collective funding ratio consists of the market value of Alecta’s assets as a percentage of the insurance obligations calculated according to Alecta’s actuarial assumptions, which do not conform to IAS 19. Under the provisions of the ITP 2 plan, measures must be taken if the funding ratio falls below 125 per cent (for example, in connection with an increase in the price of the subscription) or exceed 150 per cent (155) (for example, in connection with a premium reduction). Valuation method for pension obligations The value of the pension obligations is determined using the Projected Unit Credit (PUC) method. This method sees each period of service as giving rise to an additional unit of benefi t entitlements/employee benefi ts. The value of the company’s employee benefi t obligations for active employees, or the Defi ned Benefi t Obligation (DBO), on the reporting date is the same as the present value of the degree of entitlement existing on this date, in terms of future salary and pension increases and turnover rates. The valuation of pension obligations of pensioners is made on the basis of the present value of current pensions taking into account future increases in pensions. The service costs can be calculated on the basis of the DBO. They correspond to the present value of the entitlements to employee benefi ts earned during the f hi h l l ti d Note 22 Other long-term liabilities Group SEK M 2020 2019 Deferred purchase consideration 386 926 Long-term liability for portfolio investments 0 99 Long-term liability to minority shareholders 192 262 Other long-term liabilities 44 16 Total 622 1,303 The change in long-term liabilities is mainly due to a transfer of SEK 622 million regarding deferred purchase consideration in subsidiaries to current liabilities, as a payment is expected to be made during 2021. Note 23 Pensions Employees in Intrum’s companies are covered by various pension benefi ts, some of which are defi ned benefi t plans and others as defi ned contribution plans. The Group applies IAS 19 Employee Benefi ts, which contains, among other things, uniform regulations on the actuarial calculation of provisions for pensions in defi ned benefi t plans. Group employees in Switzerland, and certain employees in Germany, are covered by pension plans funded through assets under the management of insurance companies and are reported as defi ned benefi t pension plans. Other employees in Germany and employees in Norway and Italy are covered by unfunded defi ned benefi t pension plans that can be paid out as a one-time sum or as monthly payments following retirement. In France, the company makes provisions for one-time payments made to employees on retirement, and these provisions are also reported according to the rules for defi ned benefi t pension plans. In Belgium and Sweden, there are pension plans, funded through insurance, which theoretically should have been reported as defi ned benefi t plans, but which are recognised as defi ned contribution plans since the company lacks suffi cient data to report them as defi ned benefi t plans. See also below regarding the ITP 2 plan. Among other things, IAS 19 requires pension costs for service in the current period to be reported in the operating earnings, while the calculated interest expense on the pension liability and the interest income from assets under management are reported in net fi nancial items. Actuarial revaluations are recognised in other comprehensive income. Provisions for pensions reported in the balance sheet can be analysed as follows: Group SEK M 2020 2019 Present value of fully or partly funded obligations 426 555 Fair value of plan assets –248 –266 Defi cit in the plan 178 289 Present value of unfunded obligations 203 98 Total provisions for pensions 381 387 Changes in net obligation: Group SEK M 2020 2019 Opening balance 387 263 Expenses for employment in current year 33 21 Interest expense 3 3 Pensions paid –30 –33 Pension provisions in acquired operations - 88 Revaluations 4 40 Exchange rate diff erences –16 5 Closing balance 381 387 Reconciliation of fair value of assets under management: Group SEK M 2020 2019 Opening balance 266 253 Fees paid 26 43 Compensation paid –41 –44 Interest revenue 0 2 Revaluations 7 –7 Exchange rate diff erences –10 18 Closing balance 248 266 The pension cost recognised in the income statement can be specifi ed as follows: Group SEK M 2020 2019 Expenses for employment in current period 33 21 Net interest income/expense 3 3 Total pension expense in net earnings for the year 35 24 Costs for employment in the current period are reported in operating earnings. Net interest income/expense is reported under net fi nancial items. Revaluations of the pension liability are included in other comprehensive income in the amount of SEK 2 M (8) before tax. In calculating Provisions for pensions, the following assumptions are used: Group % 2020 2019 Discount rate 0.18–2.00 0.85–2.50 Assumed rate of increase in compensation 0.5–2.0 1.0–2.5 Assumed return on assets under management 0.8–2.0 1.0–2.0 Assumed pension increases 0.0–1.75 0.4–2.0 Future adjustment to social security base 0.0–2.0 2.0–4.2 The Group also fi nances a number of defi ned contribution plans, Consolidated expenses for these amounted to SEK 191 M (146). ----- Note 24 Other provisions Group SEK M 2020 2019 Opening balances 168 154 Amounts utilised during the year –88 –99 Unutilised amounts reversed during the year –64 –65 New provisions for the year 58 146 Provisions in acquired operations 0 29 Translation diff erences –2 3 Closing balances 72 168 Of which, long-term provisions Expenses for returning leased offi ce premises to their 2 0 original condition Personnel expenses 3 3 Legal claims 41 16 Other 1 0 Total long-term provisions 47 19 Of which, short-term provisions Expenses for returning leased offi ce premises to their 3 1 original condition Expenses for termination of personnel and other 15 91 restructuring expenses Consultancy (legal, tax and compliance) 7 2 Other 0 55 Total short-term provisions 25 149 Total 72 168 Short- term provisions are expected to be settled within 12 months from of the balance sheet date.

All operational and fi nancial covenants were fully met in 2020. In July 2020, Intrum issued a fi ve-year unsecured bond of EUR 600 M at a fi xed interest rate of 4.875 per cent. The proceeds were used to refi nance a fi xed-rate bond maturing in 2022. In September, a supplementary issue of EUR 250 M was implemented at an issue price of 100,75, giving an eff ective interest rate of 4.70 per cent. The proceeds of the supplementary issue were used to repay outstanding amounts within Intrum’s loan facility. During the third quarter, Intrum issued two unsecured bonds – a two-year bond of SEK 750 M at STIBOR 3m +250 basis points, and a fi ve-year bond of SEK 1.250 M at STIBOR 3m +460 basis points. The bonds were issued within the framework of the existing Swedish MTN programme. During 2020 commercial papers increased by SEK 122 M.

Pledged collateral also includes shares in subsidiaries within the Group pledged as collateral for the Parent Company’s revolving credit facility. The reported value of pledged collateral in the table above refers to the consolidated value of the subsidiaries’ net assets. Payment guarantees The Group off ers services whereby clients, against payment, obtain a guarantee from Intrum regarding the clients’ receivables from their customers. This entails a risk being incurred that Intrum must compensate the customer for the guaranteed amount in the event that the invoices are not paid on time. In those cases where the guarantee comes into play, Intrum assumes the client’s claim against its customer and takes over the continued handling of the case within the Portfolio Investments area of operations. At the end of the year, the total amount guaranteed was SEK 70 M (92). Intrum’s risk in this business is managed through strict credit limits and analyses of the borrower’s credit status. At the end of the year Intrum had allocated SEK 1 M (1) in the balance sheet to cover payments that may arise due to the guarantee. Other In Spain, a dispute is pending in which a former customer has claimed damages amounting to EUR 5 M due to alleged shortcomings in the provision of certain services. The claim has been disputed. The possible eff ect on the Group’s earnings of the above dispute is not assessed to be signifi cant, and Intrum has, for reasons of caution, made a partial provision for the dispute. The Group is also involved in other legal actions: in part a number of minor disputes and, in part, legal actions in the normal course of business. In the opinion of the Board, none of these disputes are expected to give rise to any signifi cant cost. ----- Note 28 Average number of employees Of which, the Parent Group Company 2020 2019 2020 2019 Men Women Men Women Men Women Men Women Austria 12 22 13 26 - - - Belgium 38 55 50 68 - - - Brazil 17 19 10 9 - - - Czech Republic 28 55 28 51 - - - Denmark 74 95 75 97 - - - Estonia 4 20 4 20 - - - Finland 138 346 124 324 - - - France 180 391 196 451 - - - Germany 133 271 147 347 - - - Greece 618 416 76 103 - - - Hungary 176 290 172 252 - - - Ireland 29 33 34 42 - - - Italy 327 446 331 467 - - - Latvia 176 91 168 91 - - - Lithuania 153 347 100 247 - - - Luxembourg 1 0 1 0 - - - Mauritius 28 74 30 77 - - - Netherlands 98 74 94 64 - - - Norway 269 364 278 322 - - - Poland 149 219 160 217 - - - Portugal 69 140 69 141 - - - Romania 43 117 63 136 - - - Slovakia 27 53 34 62 - - - Spain 698 1,214 736 1,303 - - - Sweden 159 237 160 266 29 28 39 31 Switzerland 97 117 123 128 - - - United Kingdom 97 114 83 96 - - - Total 3,838 5,624 3,359 5,407 29 28 39 31 Of the Group’s employees, 20 per cent are younger than 30 years old, 33 per cent are 30–39 years old, 30 per cent are 40–49 years old and 17 per cent are 50 years old or older. 2020 2019 Men Women Men Women Gender distribution of senior executives Board of Directors 6 3 6 3 Group Management Team 10 4 9 2 Country Managers 20 3 19 3 Board members in subsidiaries 84% 16% 83% 17% Seven members of the Group Management Team are employees of the Parent Company.

The notice period may not exceed six months without any right to severance pay when termination is made by the GMT member. Remuneration for non-compete undertakings shall compensate for loss of income. The remuneration amounts to not more than 100 per cent of the Base Salary at the time of termination of employment, unless otherwise provided by mandatory collective agreement provisions, and be paid during the time the non-compete undertaking applies, however not for more than twelve months following termination of employment. _Remuneration and employment conditions for employees_ In preparation of the Board’s proposal for these guidelines and when evaluating whether the guidelines and the limitations set out herein are reasonable, account has been taken regarding the remuneration and employment conditions for employees of the company. This has been done by reviewing e.g. the employees’ total remuneration, the components of their remuneration and remuneration growth rate over time. _The decision-making process to determine, review and implement the guidelines_ The Board has established a Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration Committee’s tasks include preparing the Board’s decision to propose these guidelines. The Board shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year and submit it to the Annual General Meeting. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the Annual General Meeting. The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor and evaluate programs for variable remuneration for the GMT, the application of the guidelines for GMT as well as the current remuneration structures and compensation levels in the company. The members of the Remuneration Committee are independent of the company and the GMT. The CEO and other members of the GMT do not participate in the Board’s processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are aff ected by such matters. _Derogation from the guidelines_ The Board may temporarily resolve to derogate from the guidelines, in whole or in part, if in a specifi c case there is special cause for the derogation and a derogation is necessary to serve the company’s long-term interests, including its sustainability, or to ensure the company’s fi nancial viability. As set out above, the Remuneration Committee’s tasks include preparing the Board’s resolutions in remuneration-related matters. This includes any resolutions to derogate from the guidelines. _Description of material changes to the guidelines and how the views of shareholders’ have been taken into consideration_ These guidelines do not entail any signifi cant changes in relation to the company’s existing guidelines, apart from the VSP levels for the CEO and CFO, the OOR and applying EBIT as VSP evaluation metric (previously, EBIT after Cost of Capital was used as a main VSP evaluation metric). The company has not received any views from shareholders to take into consideration. Terms of employment and remuneration of the CEO Note 30 Terms and conditions of employment for senior executives Guidelines on remuneration of senior executives The 2020 Annual General Meeting adopted the following guidelines for executive remuneration. The guidelines apply to the CEO and other members of Intrum’s Group Management Team (“GMT”). The guidelines are forward-looking, i.e. they are applicable to agreements on remuneration, and on amendments to remuneration already agreed, enter into after adoption of the guidelines by the Annual General Meeting 2020. These guidelines do not apply to any remuneration to be separately resolved or approved by the General Meeting. _The guidelines’ promotion of the company’s business strategy, long-term interests and sustainability_ Intrum’s business strategy is, in short, to continue to grow, both in existing and new markets, and to continue to build its position as the undisputed market leader within the credit management industry. For more information regarding the company’s business strategy, visions and goals, please see www.intrum.com. A prerequisite for the successful implementation of the company’s business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests, including its sustainability, is that the company is able to recruit and retain qualifi ed personnel. To this end, it is necessary that the company off ers competitive remuneration. These guidelines enable the company to off er the GMT a competitive total remuneration. Long-term share-related incentive programmes (“LTIPs”) have been implemented in the company. Such LTIPs have been resolved by the Annual General Meeting and are therefore excluded from these guidelines. The LTIP proposed by the Board and submitted to the Annual General Meeting 2020 for approval is excluded for the same reason. The proposed LTIP essentially corresponds to existing LTIPs. The LTIPs includes the GMT and other senior managers and key employees in the company. The evaluation metrics used to assess the outcome of the LTIPs are distinctly linked to the business strategy and thereby to the company’s long-term value creation. At present, these metrics are linked to the company’s Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) target established by the Board. Variable cash remuneration covered by these guidelines shall aim at promoting the company’s business strategy and long-term interests, including its sustainability. _Forms of remuneration_ Remuneration in the company should refl ect job complexity, responsibility and performance, and it should be competitive in comparison with similar companies within similar industries in the relevant geography. The remuneration shall consist of the following components: annual fi xed cash salary (“Base Salary”), annual variable cash remuneration (“Variable Salary Part/ VSP”), pension benefi ts and other benefi ts. Additionally, the General Meeting may – irrespective of these guidelines – resolve on, among other things, share-related or share price-related remuneration such as LTIPs. _Base Salary_ The Base Salary is based on three cornerstones: job complexity & responsi _Variable Salary Part/VSP_ The VSP seeks to drive, and is designed to vary with, short-term business performance, and is set for one year at a time. The evaluation metrics are individually decided for each member of the GMT, and consist of Earnings Before Interest & Tax (“EBIT”) (on group level or country level/s, as applicable) for all GMT members, except for the CIO for whom the metrics Portfolio Investment Service Line Earnings, Return On Investments and Book Value Growth are also applied. The Board may also decide to adjust the metrics targets or apply other similar evaluation metrics if deemed appropriate. The maximum VSP pay-out is 100 per cent of the Base Salary for the CEO and the CFO. For the other members of the GMT (except for the Chief Risk Offi cer, who is not eligible for VSP) the normal maximum VSP pay-out shall be 30 to 50 per cent of the Base Salary, but for 2020 a maximum of 45 to 75 per cent of the Base Salary shall apply (the “One Off Remuneration”/”OOR”). The CEO and the CFO are not eligible for the OOR. To which extent the evaluation metrics for awarding VSP have been satisfi ed shall be evaluated and determined when the measurement period has ended. The company’s Remuneration Committee is responsible for preparing the VSP evaluation for all GMT members. The determination of the VSP outcome is then resolved by the Board in its entirety. No deferral periods are applied in relation to VSP and the VSP agreement does not contain any clause entitling the company to reclaim VSP. _Base Salary and VSP costs_ The costs are estimated not to exceed MSEK 45.8 for the Base Salary, and MSEK 33.2 for VSP 2020, including the OOR but excluding social security contributions. These estimates do not take into account possible changes to the GMT during the year. Pension benefi ts and other benefi ts Intrum applies a retirement age of 65 for all members of the GMT, unless otherwise follows from applicable national rules. For the CEO, pension benefi ts, including health insurance (Sw: sjukförsäkring), shall be premium defi ned. VSP does not constitute pensionable income. The pension premiums for premium defi ned pension shall amount to not more than 35 per cent of the Base Salary. For other GMT members, pension benefi ts, including health insurance, shall be premium defi ned unless the individual concerned is subject to defi ned benefi t pension under mandatory collective agreement provisions. Variable cash remuneration shall qualify for pension benefi ts to the extent required by mandatory collective agreement provisions. The pension premiums for premium defi ned pension shall amount to not more than 30 per cent of the Base Salary. Other benefi ts than pension benefi ts may include, for example, life insurance, medical insurance (Sw: sjukvårdsförsäkring), housing and company cars. For GMT members with housing benefi ts, such benefi ts may not amount to more than 20 per cent of the Base Salary. For GMT members without housing benefi ts, such benefi ts may not amount to more than ten per cent of the Base Salary. For employments governed by rules other than Swedish, pension benefi ts and other benefi ts may be duly adjusted for compliance with mandatory rules or local practice, taking into account the overall purpose of these guidelines. _Termination of employment_ Th ti i d t d t l th if ti f t i ----- above. His fi xed monthly salary as CEO has been EUR 58,333. In addition to his fi xed salary, he had the opportunity to receive up to 100 percent of his annual salary within the framework of the variable salary component (VSP) and up to 150 percent of his annual salary within the framework of the 2018 long-term remuneration programme (LTI). He was off ered participation in LTIP 2020 with an initial allocation of 200 percent of his fi xed annual salary. In addition to his salary, the company paid pension contributions corresponding to 30 percent of his fi xed annual salary. The pension policy is a defi ned contribution plan, and the retirement age is 65 years. He also had a company car in accordance with the Group’s car policy. In the event of resignation by the employee, the period of notice is six months and, in the event of termination by the company, the period of notice is twelve months. In the event of termination on the part of the company, severance pay of 12 months’ fi xed salary is payable. The outcome of LTIP 2018 was 100 percent, corresponding to 36,002 shares in Anders Engdahl’s case. The total number of shares outstanding for the CEO in LTI 2019 and 2020, which run until the end of 2021 and 2022 respectively, will be 102,334 shares if fully vested. Mikael Ericson was President and CEO until 17 October 2020. He remained at the company’s disposal until 31 December 2020. In accordance with his employment contract, a notice period of 12 months applies as of 17 October 2020, during which his terms of employment remain unchanged. In addition, he is entitled to severance pay corresponding to 12 months’ fi xed salary, continued participation in the variable salary programme (VSP) and continued participation in the outstanding long-term incentive programmes (LTIP) for 2018 and 2019. Terms of employment and remuneration for other members of Group Management The remuneration and other terms of employment for other members of Group Management which were approved following the 2020 Annual General Meeting have followed the principles outlined above. This includes fi xed annual salary and the opportunity to receive 0–50 percent of annual salary within the framework of the variable salary component. The long-term incentive programme for 2020 was launched in October 2020 with allocation levels in accordance with the resolution of the Annual General Meeting, that is, 35–100 percent of fi xed annual salary. Pension benefi ts vary from country to country. In several cases, they are included in monthly salaries. All pension insurances plans are defi ned contribution plans, except in cases where mandatory collective agreements apply, and the retirement age is generally 65 years. Members of Group Management have company cars, in accordance with the Group’s car policy. Other benefi ts also occur, in accordance with local practices, including subsidised meals and travel. The notice of termination for members of Group Management Team varies from three to 12 months, regardless of whether termination is initiated by the employee or the company. LTIP 2018 was fully vested at the end of 2020 and, in accordance with the terms of the programme, the shares must be transferred prior to the 2021 Annual General Meeting. For Group Management (excluding the President and CEO), the maximum allotment in LTIP 2018 amounts to a total of 48,402 shares. The total number of shares outstanding in LTIP 2019 and 2020 for the corresponding group amounts to 126,074 shares.

IFRS 16 requires that all agreements constituting a lease be reported in the balance sheet as a liability, corresponding to the present value of future lease payments, and as a right-of-use asset. There also has an eff ect on the income statement, primarily a reclassifi cation from on-going leasing costs to depreciation and interest expenses. As of 2019, all of Intrum’s leases are instead reported as non-current assets and fi nancial liabilities in the statement of fi nancial position, except as set out below. As a lessee, Intrum will continue, in 2020, to report its leasing agreements in accordance with IFRS 16. The right-of-use assets are depreciated linearly over the term of the lease. The lease liability is equal to the discounted present value of future lease payments over the remaining term of the lease. The discount rate applied is the marginal borrowing rate as Intrum is unable to determine the implicit interest rate. Rather than reporting the leasing fee as an operating expense, Intrum reports depreciation and interest expenses under Total comprehensive income for the year. Interest expenses for the lease liability are calculated in accordance with the eff ective interest method and are reported under fi nancial items. Leases with a term of at most 12 months are considered to be current leases. These are always beyond the scope and are reported as on-going expenses. If leases pertain to ”low-value assets”, such as personal computers, laptops, tablets, telephones, offi ce equipment or other items where the new price is typically below USD 5,000 (or EUR 4,300), they are not covered by IFRS 16 and are therefore recognised as ongoing expenses as prior to application of IFRS 16. Leased items covered by IFRS 16 within Intrum are offi ce premises, motor vehicles, expensive IT equipment and other leasing. The foremost eff ect on the consolidated fi nancial statements derives from accounting for offi ce premises. The change in right-of-use assets and lease liabilities since implementation is summarised below. The total value of the right-of-use assets has decreased slightly. ----- Right-of-use assets Land and Motor ITC SEK M buildings vehicles equipment Other Total 2019 Opening balance, 691 32 0 5 728 1 January Additions to right-of- 363 34 0 3 400 use assets in 2019 1) Financial assets include the balance sheet items: purchased debt, other long-term receivables, accounts receivable, client funds, other current receivables, accrued income, derivatives with positive value, cash and cash equivalents and, for the Parent Company, also intra-Group receivables. 2) Derivatives and deferred considerations are the only fi nancial instruments restated at fair value. They are revalued based on a valuation technique that uses observable market data and thus falls under Level 2 in the valuation hierarchy according to IFRS 13. Deferred considerations related to acquisitions of shares in subsidiaries are restated at fair value in accordance with level 3. 3) Financial liabilities include the balance sheet items: non-current and current liabilities to credit institutions, bond loans, commercial papers, client funds payable, accounts payable, advances from clients, other current liabilities, accrued expenses and, for the Parent Company, intra-Group liabilities. 4) Portfolio investments Portfolio investments consist of purchased debt reported at amortised cost according applying an eff ective interest rate model with an eff ective interest rate refl ecting the risk of defaulted payment. Taking into account that purchased receivables are deemed to be in default, they are classifi ed in accordance with the third stage of credit risk in accordance with the classifi cation in IFRS 9. The Group determines the carrying value by calculating the present value of estimated future cash fl ows at the receivables’ original eff ective interest rate. Adjustments are recognised in the income statement. With this valuation method, the carrying value is the best estimate of the fair value of debt portfolios, in the company’s opinion. An account of purchased debt by year acquired is provided in Note 34. 5) Accounts receivable Accounts receivable are recognised at amortised cost with no discount being applied since the remaining maturity is judged to be short. 6) Other receivables Other receivables have short maturities. Receivables in foreign currency are translated in the accounts at balance sheet date rates. Consequently, carrying value corresponds to fair value. 7) Cash and cash equivalents Liquid assets mainly consist of bank balances. Liquid assets in foreign currency mainly consist of bank balances. Liquid assets in foreign currency are translated in the accounts at balance sheet date rate. 8) Liabilities to credit institutions The Parent Company’s and the Group’s loan liabilities carry market rate interest with short fi xed interest terms. Liabilities in foreign currency are translated in the accounts at balance sheet date rates. Consequently, carrying value corresponds to fair value. 9) Accounts payable Accounts payable have short maturities. Liabilities in foreign currency are translated in the accounts at balance sheet date rates. Consequently, carrying value corresponds to fair value. 10) Other liabilities The Parent Company’s and the Group’s other liabilities have short maturities.

There is an economic relationship between the hedged balance sheet items and the hedging instruments, in which the effi ciency of the hedge is tested and adjusted monthly. The eff ects of the translation exposure and hedging measures have opposite values (negative/positive) and are reported under Other comprehensive income. The hedging instruments amounted to SEK –31,141 M (– 30,120) at year-end. No ineffi ciencies were reported during the year regarding hedges of net investments in foreign operations. _Interest rate risks_ Interest rate risks relate primarily to the Group’s interest-bearing net debt, which amounted to SEK 46,951 M (49,105) on 31 December 2020. The loan rate is tied to the market rate. Intrum has a strong cash fl ow which gives the Group the option of repaying loans or investing in portfolios. The Group’s loans have a fi xed interest term – currently about 44 months (46) for the entire loan portfolio. A 1-per cent increase in market interest rates during the year would have adversely aff ected net fi nancial items by approximately SEK 367 M. A fi ve-per cent increase would have adversely aff ected net fi nancial items by SEK 1,833 M. To establish an appropriate matching of currencies in the balance sheet and thus manage the currency risk between assets and liabilities, the company uses currency interest rate swaps in which the Parent Company swaps liabilities in SEK and receives EUR at the same rate on both the start and maturity dates. In this way, the company can maintain the desired level of hedging of shareholders’ equity per currency while also maintaining an interest rate exposure in the same currency. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk of a loss or higher-than-expected costs to ensure the Group’s ability to fulfi l its short and long-term payment obligations to outside parties. The Group’s long-term fi nancing risk is limited by confi rmed loan facilities. The Group’s objective is that at least 35 per cent of total committed loans have a remaining maturity of at least three years and that not more than 35 per cent of the total have a remaining maturity of less than 12 months. Intrum AB is fi nanced through a revolving syndicated loan facility, bonds, bilateral loans and commercial papers. The loan facility is arranged with a banking consortium comprising 14 banks and applies until January 2026. The loan facility contains operations-related and fi nancial covenants, including limits on specifi c fi nancial indicators. In addition, the credit agreement includes covenants that may restrict, condition or prohibit the Group from incurring additional debt, making acquisitions, disposing of assets, making capital and fi nance lease expenditures, allowing assets to be encumbered, changing the scope of the Group’s business and entering into a merger agreement. As of 31 December 2020, the loan framework had been utilised in the total amount of SEK 2,223 M (6,186), which can be broken down into NOK 2,075 M, EUR 10 M and GBP 12 M. The unutilised portion of the facilities amounted to SEK 14,927 M (8,178). The loan carries a variable interest rate based on the interbank rate in each currency, with a margin. All operational and fi nancial covenants were fully met in 2020. In July 2020, Intrum issued a fi ve-year unsecured bond of EUR 600 M at a fi xed interest rate of 4.875 per cent. The proceeds were used to refi nance a fi xed-rate bond maturing in 2022. In September, a supplementary issue of EUR 250 M was implemented at an issue price of 100.75, giving an eff ective i t t t f 4 70 t Th d f th l t i 11) Off set of fi nancial instruments Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value comprise derivatives. Financial assets and liabilities are not off set in the balance sheet. However, there are legally binding agreements that allow off setting should one of the counterparties for the Group’s derivatives suspend their payments. At the end of the year, Intrum had fi nancial assets totalling SEK 295 M (204) that could be off set should the counterparties suspend their payments. Note 34 Financial risks and fi nancial policies Principles of fi nancing and fi nancial risk management The fi nancial risks that arise in Intrum operations are limited. Thanks to a strong cash fl ow, combined with little need for investment and operating capital, external capital needs in the Group’s service operations are relatively low. The purchased debt operations have a greater need for capital, particularly during a growth phase. Intrum’s fi nancing and fi nancial risks are managed within the Group in accordance with the treasury policy established by the Board of Directors. The treasury policy contains rules for managing fi nancial activities, delegating responsibility, measuring and identifying fi nancial risks and limiting these risks. Internal and external fi nancial operations are concentrated in Group Treasury in Stockholm and Oslo. This achieves economies of scale in terms of pricing for fi nancial transactions. Because Group Treasury can take advantage of temporary surpluses and defi cits in the Group’s various countries of operation, the Group’s total interest expense can be minimised. Market risk Market risk consists of risks related to changes in exchange rates and interest rate levels. _Exchange rate risk_ Exchange rate risk is the risk that fl uctuations in exchange rates will negatively aff ect the Group’s income statement, balance sheet and/or cash fl ows. The most important currencies for the Intrum Group, other than the Swedish krona (SEK), are the euro (EUR), the Swiss franc (CHF), the Hungarian forint (HUF) and the Norwegian krone (NOK). The following exchange rates have been used to translate transactions in foreign currency in the fi nancial accounts: Average Average Currency 31 Dec 2020 31 Dec 2019 2020 2019 CHF 9.29 9.62 9.80 9.52 EUR 10.03 10.45 10.48 10.59 HUF 0.0276 0.0316 0.0299 0.0326 NOK 0.96 1.06 0.98 1.07 Exchange rate risk can be divided into transaction exposure and translation exposure. Transaction exposure consists of net operating and fi nancial receipts and disbursements in diff erent currencies. Translation exposure consists of the eff ects from the translation of the fi nancial reports of foreign subsidiaries and associated companies to SEK. _Transaction exposure_ ables and liabilities in foreign currency. Income and expenses in national currency are thereby hedged in a natural way, which limits transaction exposure. The currency exposure that arises within the operating activities is limited to the extent it pertains to international collection operations. The subsidiaries’ projected fl ow exposure is not hedged at present. All major known currency fl ows are hedged on a continuous basis in the Group and the Parent Company through forward exchange contracts. _Translation exposure_ Intrum operates in 25 countries. The results and fi nancial position of subsidiaries are reported in the relevant foreign currencies and later translated into SEK for inclusion in the consolidated fi nancial statements. Consequently, fl uctuations in the SEK exchange rate aff ect consolidated income and earnings, as well as equity and other items in the fi nancial statements. The Group’s revenues are distributed by currency as follows: SEK M 2020 2019 SEK 1,031 936 EUR 10,371 9,766 CHF 1,120 804 HUF 1,304 1,434 NOK 1,212 1,575 Other currencies 1,810 1,470 Total 16,848 15,985 An appreciation of the Swedish krona of 10 percentage points on average in 2020 against EUR would thus, all else being equal, have aff ected revenues negatively by SEK 1,037 M, against CHF by SEK 112 M, against HUF by SEK 130 M and against NOK by SEK 121 M. In terms of net assets by currency, shareholders’ equity in the Group, including non-controlling interests, is distributed as follows: SEK M 2020 2019 SEK 11,988 21,303 EUR 23,498 17,470 – less EUR hedged through foreign currency loans –25,907 –27,151 + EUR hedged through derivatives 6,745 8,817 CHF 685 530 – less CHF hedged through derivatives –106 –110 DKK –17 –3 – less DKK hedged through derivatives –67 –70 HUF 2,881 2,460 – less HUF hedged through derivatives –1,930 –1,896 NOK 4,003 4,185 – less NOK hedged through foreign currency loans –3,426 –3,760 Other currencies 3,616 3,118 Total 21,963 24,893 All else being equal, an appreciation in the Swedish krona of 10 percentage points as per 31 December 2020 against EUR would have aff ected shareholders’ equity in the Group negatively by SEK 434 M, negatively against CHF by SEK 58 M, positively against DKK by SEK 8 M, negatively against HUF by SEK 95 M and negatively against NOK by SEK 58 M. Regarding the currency risk attributable to currency interest rate swaps, see the description below under Interest rate risks ----- 750 M at STIBOR 3m +250 basis points, and a fi ve-year bond of SEK 1.250 M at STIBOR 3m +460 basis points. The bonds were issued within the framework of the existing Swedish MTN programme. Consequently, Intrum has outstanding bond loans for a total SEK 43,706 M (41,645). During 2020 commercial papers increased by SEK 122 M. At the end of the year, commercial papers amounted to SEK 2,916 M (2,794). The increase in commercial papers issued was used to repay outstanding amounts within Intrum’s credit facility. The Group’s aim is that the liquidity reserve, which consists of cash, bank balances and short-term liquid investments should amount to at least SEK 100 M more than the unutilised portion of committed lines of credit. The Group has deposited its liquid assets with established fi nancial institutions where the risk of loss is considered remote. The Group’s fi nance function prepares regular liquidity forecasts with the purpose of optimising the balance between loans and liquid funds so that the net interest expense is minimised without, for that matter, incurring diffi culties in meeting external commitments. The table below provides an analysis of the fi nancial liabilities of the Group and the Parent Company broken down according to the amount of time remaining until the contractual maturity date. The amounts given in the table are the contractual, undiscounted cash fl ows. The amounts falling due within 12 months agree with the reported amounts since the discount eff ect is negligible.

Financial assets that potentially subject the Group to credit risk include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, portfolio investments, outlays on behalf of clients, derivatives and guarantees. For fi nancial assets owned by Intrum, no collateral or other credit reinforcements have been received, with the exception of a certain portion of the Group’s portfolio investments. The maximum credit exposure for each class of fi nancial assets corresponds to the carrying amount. _Cash and cash equivalents_ The Group’s cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of bank balances and other short-term fi nancial assets with a remaining maturity of less than three months. The Group has deposited its liquid assets with established banks where the risk of loss is considered remote. _Accounts receivable_ The Group’s accounts receivable from clients and debtors in various industries, and are not concentrated in a specifi c geographical region. The Group’s largest client accounts for less than two per cent of revenues. Most accounts receivable outstanding are with customers previously known to the Group and whose creditworthiness is good. For an analysis of accounts receivable by age, see Note 17. _Portfolio investments_ As part of its portfolio investment operations, Intrum acquires portfolios of consumer receivables and tries to collect them. Unlike its conventional collection operations where Intrum works on behalf of clients in return for commissions and fees, in this case it assumes all the rights and risks associated with the receivables. The portfolios are purchased at prices signifi cantly below their nominal value, and Intrum retains the entire amount it collects, including interest and fees. The acquired receivables are overdue and in many cases are from debtors who are having payment problems. It is obvious, therefore, that the entire nominal amount of the receivable will not be recovered. On the other hand, the receivables are acquired at prices signifi cantly below their nominal value. The risk in this business is that Intrum, at the time of acquisition, overestimates its ability to collect the amounts or underestimates the costs of collection. The maximum theoretical risk is of course that the entire carrying value of SEK 27,658 M (28,508) would become worthless and have to be written off . To minimise the risks in this business, prudence is exercised in purchase decisions. The focus is on small and medium-sized portfolios with relatively low average amounts to help spread risks The average nominal value per case is approx erally consisted of unsecured debt, requiring relatively less capital and signifi cantly simplifying administration compared with collateralised receivables. Since 2016, however, Intrum has also begun to acquire portfolios with underlying collateral, usually in the form of property mortgages. Intrum places high yield requirements on the portfolios it acquires. Before every acquisition, a careful assessment is made based on a projection of future cash fl ows (collected amount) from the portfolio. In these calculations Intrum benefi ts from its extensive experience in debt collection and from the Group’s scoring methods. Intrum therefore believes that it has the expertise required to evaluate these types of receivables. To enable acquisitions of larger portfolios at attractive risk levels, Intrum has, on occasion, partnered with other companies such as Pireus Bank and Ibercaja Banco to share the capital investment and return. The currency risk is attributable to the translation of the balance sheet item Portfolio investments is limited due to currency hedging using loans in the same currency as the assets, and currency forwards. A considerable proportion of the acquisitions take place through forward fl ow agreements – that is, Intrum may have previously agreed with a company to acquire all of that company’s accounts receivable at a certain percentage of their nominal value once they are overdue by a certain number of days. In most of these agreements, however, Intrum has the opportunity to decline to acquire the receivables if, for example, their quality decreases. Risks are diversifi ed by acquiring receivables from clients in diff erent sectors and diff erent countries. The Group’s purchased debt portfolios include debtors in 24 countries. The Group’s total carrying amount for purchased debt is distributed as follows: Receivables by country Telecom companies, 6% (5) Bank sector, 66% (63) Credit card receivables, 10% (11) Other fi nancial operations, 12% (15) Other segments, 6% (6) Of the total carrying value on the balance sheet date, 17 per cent represents portfolio acquisitions in 2020, 20 per cent acquisitions in 2019, 14 per cent acquisitions in 2018 and 14 per cent acquisitions in 2017. The remaining 35 per cent relates to receivables acquired in or before 2016, which have therefore been past due for more than four years. In the case of a large share of the oldest receivables, Intrum has reached agreement with the debtors on payment plans. As at 31 December 2020 the undiscounted acquired loss allowances at initial recognition amounted to SEK 47,432 M (62,835) for credit-impaired loan portfolios acquired by the Group during January to December Spain, 12% (15) UK, 12% (10) Norway, 11% (13) Germany, 10% (10) Receivables by industry Sweden, 8% (7) France, 5% (6) Other countries, 41% (39) ----- _Outlays on behalf of clients_ As an element in its operations, the Group incurs outlays for court fees, legal representation, enforcement authorities, etc., which can be charged to and collected from debtors. In many cases Intrum has agreements with its clients whereby any expenses that cannot be collected from debtors are instead refunded by the client. The amount that is expected to be recovered from a solvent counterparty is recognised as an asset in the balance sheet on the line Other receivables. _Derivative contracts_ The Parent Company and the Group hold forward exchange contracts to a limited extent. The credit risk in the Group’s forward exchange contracts is because the counterparty generally is a large bank or fi nancial institution that is not expected to become insolvent. On the balance sheet date, assets regarding forward exchange contracts were valued at SEK 295 M (204), and liabilities at SEK 443 M (356). See Note 33 regarding the possibility of off setting receivables and liabilities for derivative contracts. The contracts have short maturities, typically one or more months. All outstanding forward exchange contracts are restated at fair value in the accounts, with adjustments recognised in the income statement. The purpose of these forward exchange contracts has been to minimise exchange rate diff erences in the Parent Company attributable to receivables and liabilities in foreign currency. Outstanding forward exchange contracts at year end in the Parent Company and in the Group comprise the following currencies: Currency Local currency, buy Hedged amount, sell CHF 24 –6 CZK 1,255 DKK 36 –751 EUR 568 –170 GBP 22 –171 HUF 28,150 –709 NOK 681 –27 PLN 14 –24 RON 26 –165 SEK 5,113 –8,381 The Parent Company and the Group also hold currency interest rate swaps, which amount to SEK 1,457 M and that were signed in connection with the Parent Company’s issue of bonds in SEK. To achieve suitable currency matching between assets and liabilities, liabilities in SEK were exchanged to NOK at the same rate on the starting date and the date of maturity. _Payment guarantees_ The Group off ers services whereby clients, against payment, obtain a guarantee from Intrum regarding the clients’ receivables from their customers. This entails a risk being incurred that Intrum must compensate the customer for the guaranteed amount in the event that the invoices are not paid on time. In those cases where the guarantee comes into play, Intrum assumes the client’s claim against its customer and takes over the continued handling of the case within the Portfolio Investments area of operations. At the end of the year, the total amount guaranteed was SEK 70 M (92). Intrum’s risk in this business is managed through strict credit limits and analyses of the borrow’ di A h d f h I h d ll d SEK 1 M (1) i h Note 35 Acquisitions In the cash fl ow statement, SEK 35 M (5,135) is reported as acquisitions of subsidiaries and joint ventures. The amount for 2020 comprises acquisitions of operations from Pragma for SEK 6 M and acquisitions of the minority share (49 per cent) in the Brazilian credit management company Intrum Brasil Consultoria e Participaçoes, S.A. of SEK –29 M. Acquisitions of operations from Pragma In April, the acquisition was completed of a small credit management company in Poland for a purchase consideration of SEK 6 M. Consolidated goodwill amounted to SEK 5 M. The operations were merged with Intrum Sp. z o.o. Poland, the company had 26 employees. Acquisition of 49 per cent of the shares in Intrum Brasil Consultoria e Participaçoes, S.A. In October, a minority holding of 49 per cent was acquired in the Brazilian credit management company Intrum Brasil Consultoria e Participaçoes, S.A. The purchase consideration amounted to SEK 29 M. The reported surplus value amounts to SEK 27 M and is reported under changes in shareholders’ equity under comprehensive income for the period. Acquisitions in 2019 In the second quarter of 2019, Intrum acquired 80 per cent of the shares in the Spanish company Solvia Servicios Inmobiliaros for SEK 1,937 M. Intrum gained a controlling infl uence over the acquired company on 24 April 2019. _Solvia_ Intrum carried out the acquisition of Solvia Servicios Inmobiliaros (Solvia) from Banco Sabadell. The acquisition entails Intrum acquiring 80 per cent of the shares in Solvia while Banco Sabadell retains 20 per cent. Solvia is one of Spain’s leading suppliers of property management services.

The transaction was completed in the fourth quarter of 2019, and the acquired business has been consolidated from the date on which Intrum gained a controlling infl uence, 1 October 2019. The operations have been separated from the bank and consolidated by Intrum in separate legal entities, in which Intrum has acquired 80 per cent of the shares. The acquisition is reported as follows in the consolidated balance sheet: Carrying amounts before Fair value SEK M the acquisition adjustments Fair value Client relationships 3,236 –991 2,245 Other intangible fi xed 426 –426 0 assets Tangible fi xed assets 235 - 235 Deferred tax asset 19 345 363 Other receivables 56 - 56 Cash and bank balances 38 - 38 Other liabilities and -302 - –302 provisions Net assets 3,708 –81 2,636 Non-controlling interests –527 Paid in cash 3,187 Deferred purchase 310 consideration Goodwill 1,427 Cash and cash equivalents 38 in acquired companies Note 36 Related parties In addition to associated companies and joint ventures, related parties include the Board of Directors and senior executives, according to Note 30, as well as close family members to these executives and other companies over which they can exert a signifi cant infl uence. All transactions with related parties are conducted on market terms and at arm’s length. In 2020, Intrum purchased services from LBHF Joint Ventures Ltd for SEK 1.7 M and from Sothernwood Consulting for SEK 0.6 M. Three individuals, including the country manager for the UK, Edward Nott, are members of the Board of LBHF Joint Venture. Although the Parent Company has close relationship to its subsidiaries, see Note 13, it has no transactions with other related parties. Over the year, the Parent Company received SEK 557 M (402) in income from sales of services to Group subsidiaries, and incurred SEK 241 M (107) in expenses attributable to services purchased from subsidiaries. ----- Return on portfolio investments Return on portfolio investments is the service line earnings for the period, excluding operations in factoring and payment guarantees, recalculated on a full-year basis, as a percentage of the average carrying amount of the balance-sheet item purchased debt. The ratio sets the service line’s earnings in relation to the amount of capital tied up and is included in the Group’s fi nancial targets. During the year, the defi nition of average book value for the full year was adjusted to be based on the average of the quarters instead of the opening and closing book value for the full year. EBITDA Operating earnings before depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) are operating earnings after reversal of depreciation of fi xed assets except portfolio investments. Cash EBITDA Cash EBITDA is adjusted operating earnings (EBIT) adding back depreciation and amortisations and portfolio amortisations. In addition, the EBIT contribution from joint ventures is replaced by the actual cash contribution from the joint venture Items aff ecting comparability Signifi cant earnings items that are not included in the Group’s normal recurring operations and that are not expected to return on a regular basis. These include revaluations of portfolio investments, restructuring costs, closure costs, reversal of restructuring or closure reservations, cost savings programmes, integration costs, extraordinary projects, divestments, impairment of non-current fi xed assets other than portfolio investments, acquisition and divestment expenses, advisory costs for discontinued acquisition projects, costs for relocation to new offi ce space, termination and recruitment costs for members of Group Management and country managers, as well as external expenses for disputes and unusual agreements. Items aff ecting comparability are specifi ed because they are diffi cult to predict and have low forecast values for the Group’s future earnings trend. Adjusted operating earnings (EBIT) Adjusted operating earnings (EBIT) is operating earnings excluding revaluations of portfolio investments and items aff ecting comparability. Not 38 Events after the end of the year On 31 January 2021 the Board of Directors of Intrum AB (publ) was informed by its largest shareholder, a Nordic Capital controlled entity, that it has granted 3,200,000 call options that entitles to purchase of 3,200,000 Intrum shares, to Intrum’s President and CEO Anders Engdahl, and 640,000 call options that entitles to purchase of 640,000 Intrum shares, to Intrum’s Chairman Per E Larsson. The call options have been purchased on market terms and the value of the call options has been calculated by an independent valuation institute using a standard valuation model (Black-Scholes). The call options are divided into fi ve series and each call option entitles to the purchase of one Intrum share during a certain exercise period and to a certain exercise price depending on the series. The call option grant does not result in any dilution for Intrum’s other existing shareholders nor does it infl ict any Note 37 Reconciliation of key fi gures SEK M 2020 2019 Items aff ecting comparability in sales Positive revaluations portfolio investments 3,145 920 Negative revaluations portfolio investments –3,178 –892 Compensation terminated BPO - 177 Items aff ecting comparability, portfolio depreciation 150 Total items aff ecting comparability in sales 117 205 Items aff ecting comparability in operating earnings Positive revaluations portfolio investments 3,145 920 Negative revaluations portfolio investments –3,178 –892 Integration expenses Lindorff - –224 Transaction expenses acquisitions –1 –274 Compensation received terminated BPO - 147 Goodwill impairment - –2,700 Effi ciency programme - –656 Items aff ecting comparability, joint ventures –1,040 Other items aff ecting comparability –119 –469 Items aff ecting comparability, portfolio depreciation 150 Total items aff ecting comparability in operating –1,043 –4,148 earnings Items aff ecting comparability by income statement item Income from customers - 177 Revenues on portfolio investments calculated 150 using the eff ective interest method Positive revaluations portfolio investments 3,145 920 Negative revaluations portfolio investments –3,178 –892 Cost of goods and services sold –120 –819 Sales, marketing and administration expenses –834 Share of the profi t or loss of associates and joint –1,040 ventures accounted for using the equity method Goodwill impairment –2,700 Total items aff ecting comparability in operating earnings –1,043 –4,148 Other items aff ecting comparability by service line Credit Management - –235 Strategic markets –106 –3,092 Portfolio investments –944 –15 Common expenses 7 –834 Total other items aff ecting comparability –1,043 –4,176 Adjusted revenues Revenues 16,848 15,985 Items aff ecting comparability –117 –205 Adjusted revenues 16,731 15,780 SEK M 2020 2019 Adjusted operating earnings Operating earnings 4,695 2,060 Items aff ecting comparability 1,043 4,148 Adjusted operating earnings 5,738 6,207 Earnings excluding revaluations Earnings from portfolio investments 3,167 4,877 Of which, revaluations 944 –28 Earnings excluding revaluations 4,111 4,849 Average carrying value Average carrying value of portfolio investments in 28,306 26,661 receivables Average carrying value of joint venture 6,292 6,094 Average carrying value of property 397 344 Total average carrying value 34,995 33,099 Return including revaluations 9 15 Return excluding revaluations 12 15 Cash EBITDA EBIT 4,695 2,060 Depreciation/amortisation 1,529 1,246 Portfolio depreciation 4,158 4,183 Portfolio revaluations 33 –28 Adjustment of earnings in joint ventures 734 –1,179 Adjustment of cash fl ow in joint ventures 338 197 Goodwill impairment - 2,700 Items aff ecting comparability, excluding portfolio 1,010 1,476 revaluations Items aff ecting comparability, joint ventures –1,040 Items aff ecting comparability, portfolio depreciation 150 Cash EBITDA 11,607 10,654 Net debt Liabilities to credit institutions 2,081 6,186 Bond loan 43,706 41,645 Provisions for pensions 381 387 Commercial papers 2,916 2,794 Liquid assets –2,134 –1,906 Closing balance of net debt 46,950 49,105 Net debt/Cash EBITDA 4.0 4.6[1] 1) The calculation of Cash EBITDA does not include any pro forma adjustments. ----- ##### Defi nitions Result concepts, key fi gures and alternative indicators Consolidated net revenues Consolidated net revenues include external credit management income (variable collection commissions, fi xed collection fees, debtor fees, guarantee commissions, subscription income, etc.), income from portfolio investments operations (collected amounts less amortisation and revaluations for the period) and other income from fi nancial services (fees and net interest from fi nancing services). Operating earnings (EBIT) Operating earnings consist of net revenues less operating expenses as shown in the income statement. Operating margin The operating margin consists of operating earnings expressed as a percentage of net revenues. Portfolio investments – collected amounts, amortisations and revaluations Portfolio investments consist of portfolios of delinquent consumer debts purchased at prices below the nominal receivable. These are recognised at amortised cost applying the eff ective interest method, based on a collection forecast established at the acquisition date of each portfolio. Net revenues attributable to portfolio investments consist of collected amounts less amortisation for the period and revaluations. The amortisation represents the period’s reduction in the portfolio’s current value, which is attributable to collection taking place as planned. Revaluation is the period’s increase or decrease in the current value of the portfolios attributable to the period’s changes in forecasts of future collection. Revenues, operating earnings and operating margin, excluding revaluations The revaluation of portfolio investments in the period is included in consolidated net revenues and operating earnings. Revaluations are performed in connection with changes in estimates of future collections, and are therefore inherently diffi cult to predict. They have a low predictive value for the Group’s future earnings performance. Consequently, Intrum also reports alternative key fi gures in which revenues, operating earnings and operating margin are calculated excluding revaluations of portfolio investments. Organic growth Organic growth refers to the average increase in net revenues in local currency, adjusted for revaluations of purchased debt portfolios and the eff ects of acquisitions and divestments of Group companies. Organic growth is a measure of the development of the Group’s existing operations that management has the ability to infl uence. Service line earnings Service line earnings relate to the operating earnings of each service line, Credit Management Services (CMS), Portfolio Investments (PI) and Strategic Markets (Greece, Italy, Spain and Brazil), excluding common costs for sales, marketing and administration. Service line margin The service line margin consists of service line earnings expressed as a percentage of net revenues. Return on portfolio investments Return on portfolio investments is the service line earnings for the period, excluding operations in factoring and payment guarantees, recalculated on a full-year basis, as a percentage of the average carrying amount of the balance-sheet item purchased debt. The ratio sets the service line’s earnings in relation to the amount of capital tied up and is included in the Group’s fi nancial targets. During the year, the defi nition of average book value for the full year was adjusted to be based on the average of the quarters instead of the opening and closing book value for the full year. Adjusted operating earnings Adjusted operating earnings (EBIT) is operating earnings excluding revaluations of portfolio investments and other items aff ecting comparability. Net debt Net debt is interest-bearing liabilities and pension provisions less liquid assets and interest-bearing receivables. Cash EBITDA Cash EBITDA is adjusted operating earnings (EBIT) adding back depreciation and amortisations and portfolio amortisations. In addition, the EBIT contribution from joint ventures is replaced by the actual cash contribution from the joint venture Non-recurring items (NRIs) Signifi cant earnings items that are not included in the Group’s normal recurring operations and that are not expected to return on a regular basis. Non-recurring items include restructuring costs, closure costs, reversal of restructuring or closure reservations, cost savings programmes, integration costs, extraordinary projects, divestments, impairment of non-current fi xed assets other than portfolio investments, acquisition and divestment expenses, advisory costs for discontinued acquisition projects, costs for relocation to new offi ce space, termination and recruitment costs for members of Group Management and country managers, as well as external expenses for disputes and unusual agreements. Non-recurring items are specifi ed because they are diffi cult to predict and have low forecast values for the Group’s future earnings trend. Items aff ecting comparability Signifi cant income statement items included in the Group’s regular recurring operations and which may recur in any form, but which distort the comparison between the periods. Estimated remaining collections, ERC Estimated remaining collections are the nominal value of expected future collections on the Group’s portfolio investments. Portfolio investments Investments in portfolios of overdue receivables for the period, with and without collateral, and investments in properties held for sale, acquired together with portfolios of receivables. Currency-adjusted change With regard to trends in revenues and operating earnings, excluding revaluations for each region, the percentage change is stated in comparison with the corresponding year-earlier period, both in terms of the change in the respective fi gures in SEK and in the form of a currency-adjusted change, in which the eff ect of changes in exchange rates has been excluded. The currency-adjusted change is a measure of the development of the Group’s operations that management has the ability to infl uence. Beta Measure of share price changes/fl uctuations relative to the market as a whole, in the form of the OMX Stockholm index. Changes that precisely follow the index produce a beta of 1.0. A beta value below 1.0 means that the changes in the share has been smaller than those in the index. Average number of employees Average number of employees over the year as full-time equivalents. Operating cash fl ow per share Cash fl ow from operating activities divided by the average number of shares over the year. Price/earnings ratio Share price at year-end divided by earnings per share before any dilution. Price/sales ratio Share price at year-end divided by net sales per share. Earnings per share Earnings for the year attributable to Parent Company shareholders, divided by the average number of shares over the year. Dividend/net earnings Dividends as a share of earnings for the year attributable to Parent Company shareholders. See also Note 38 on page 95. ----- ##### Proposed appropriation of earnings The Parent Company’s distributable funds are at the disposal of the Board of Directors as follows: SEK Share premium reserve 17,441,835,284 Retained earnings -5,937,679,426 Net earnings for the year 419,219,769 Total 11,923,375,627 The Board of Director propose that the earnings be distributed as follows[1]: SEK Dividend, 131,541,320 shares x SEK 11.00 1,450,451,016 Balance carried forward 10,472,924,611 Total 11,923,375,627 1) The total amount of the dividend payment and the amount carried forward as distributable retained earnings after the dividend pay-out, will be adjusted based on the amount of treasury shares held by Intrum at the record date for the dividend payment. The Board of Directors’ complete statement motivating the proposed disposition of earnings for the 2021 fi scal year will be presented in a separate document prior to the 2020 Annual General Meeting. It concludes, among other things, that the proposed dividend is in line with the Company’s dividend policy and that the Board, having considered the nature, scope and risks of the Company’s operations, as well as the Company’s and the Group’s consolidation requirements, liquidity and fi nancial position in general, has found no indications that the proposed dividend is unjustifi ed. The Board of Directors and the President certify that the Annual Report has been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards in Sweden and that the consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with the international accounting standards referred to in Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002 on the application of international accounting standards. Stockholm, 26 March 2021 Anders Engdahl President and CEO The annual accounts and consolidated accounts give a true and fair view of the fi nancial position and results of the Parent Company and the Group. The Board of Directors’ Report for the Parent Company and the Group gives a true and fair overview of the operations, fi nancial position and results of the Parent Company and the Group, and describes signifi cant risks and uncertainties that the Parent Company and the companies in the Group face. The annual and consolidated accounts were approved for publication by the Board of Directors and the President on 26 March 2021 and are proposed for approval by the Annual General Meeting on 29 April 2021.

Ernst & Young AB Jesper Nilsson ----- ## Auditor’s report To the general meeting of the shareholders of Intrum AB (publ), corporate identity number 556607-7581 Report on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts Opinions We have audited the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of Intrum AB (publ) for the year 2020. The annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the company are included on pages 51-97 in this document. In our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the fi nancial position of the parent company as of 31 December 2020 and its fi nancial performance and cash fl ow for the year then ended in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act. The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the fi nancial position of the group as of 31 December 2020 and their fi nancial performance and cash fl ow for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU, and the Annual Accounts Act. The statutory administration report is consistent with the other parts of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. We therefore recommend that the general meeting of shareholders adopts the income statement and balance sheet for the parent company and the group. Our opinions in this report on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts are consistent with the content of the additional report that has been submitted to the parent company’s audit committee in accordance with the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 11. Basis for Opinions We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities section. We are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfi lled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. This includes that, based on the best of our knowledge and belief, no prohibited services referred to in the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 5.1 have been provided to the audited company or, where applicable, its parent company or its controlled companies within the EU. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters of the audit are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signifi cance in our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of, and in forming our opinion thereon, the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context. We have fulfi lled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report including of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the fi nancial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying fi nancial statements. Income recognition _Description_ Consolidated net revenues for 2020 amounted to SEK 16,848 M. As is evident from notes 3 and 4 to the annual accounts, net revenues are distributed between the various revenue sources, including collection fees, commissions and fees, as well as amounts collected on portfolio investments less amortisation. The number of transactions in the various fl ows is extensive, which places high demands on the Company’s internal controls and administrative processes. We have therefore assessed the income statement and the related IT systems as a particularly important area in the audit. _How our audit addressed this key audit matter_ In our audit, we examined principles for revenue recognition, processes for signifi cant revenue streams and related IT systems. We have, among other things, tested the Company’s controls, performed an analytical review and evaluated the eff ectiveness of the Company’s controls for IT systems of relevance for income recognition. On a random basis, we have also examined income against agreements and amounts paid in. Processes for programme development, programme changes and access management have been reviewed, as has the monitoring and handling of incidents. We have also reviewed the disclosures in the fi nancial statements regarding income recognition. Valuation of goodwill _Description_ Goodwill is reported in the amount of SEK 31,650 M in the consolidated balance sheet as per 31 December 2020. The Company tests, at least annually and when there is an indication of impairment, that the carrying values do not exceed the assets’ recoverable amounts. The recoverable amounts are determined by calculating the value in use of each cash generating unit, in connection with which estimated future cash fl ows are discounted. The Company’s cash fl ow forecasts are based on historical experience, business plans and other forward-looking assessments. A description of the accounting principles for goodwill is presented in Note 1 and the impairment testing, as well as critical estimates and assumptions are presented in notes 2 and 11. As a consequence of the reported amounts being of material importance to the fi nancial reporting and the assessments and critical assumptions required for the calculation of the value in use, we have assessed valuation of goodwill as an area of particular importance in the audit. _How our audit addressed this key audit matter_ We have assessed the Company’s process for performing impairment testing. We have examined valuation methods and calculations, the reasonableness of the assumptions made and sensitivity analyses for changed assumptions supported by our valuation specialists. Comparisons have been made with historical results and the precision of previous forecasts has been evaluated We have Valuation of Portfolio investments _Description_ Portfolio investments is reported at SEK 27 658 M in the consolidated balance sheet as per 31 December 2020. Reporting follows the eff ective interest method, where the carrying value of each portfolio corresponds to the present value of expected future cash fl ows. The expected cash fl ows are discounted at an eff ective interest rate determined on the acquisition of the respective portfolios. Current cash fl ow projections and book values are monitored over the course of the year based on, among other things, achieved collection results, agreements reached with customers on instalment plans and macroeconomic information. Accounting principles for portfolio investments are presented in note 1, critical estimates and assumptions are presented in note 2, and a description of portfolio investments is given in note 15. The Company’s valuation of portfolio investments is considered to be a particularly important area in the audit due to reported amounts being of signifi cance for the fi nancial reporting and the portfolio valuations require the Company to make estimates, assumptions and judgements. _How our audit addressed this key audit matter_ In our audit, we have, among other things, evaluated the Company’s processes for valuing portfolio investments, related IT systems, the valuation models applied, and the reasonableness of the assumptions made in calculating eff ective interest rates. We have also reviewed the company’s ongoing review of book values. We have also reviewed the disclosures in the fi nancial statements regarding portfolio investments. Other Information than the annual accounts and consolidated accounts This document also contains other information than the annual accounts and consolidated accounts and is found on pages 1-50 and 100-112. The remuneration report for the fi nancial year 2020 also constitutes other information. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for this other information. Our opinion on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts does not cover this other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion regarding this other information. In connection with our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, our responsibility is to read the information identifi ed above and consider whether the information is materially inconsistent with the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. In this procedure we also take into account our knowledge otherwise obtained in the audit and assess whether the information otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we, based on the work performed concerning this information, conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the preparation of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts and that they give a fair presentation in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and, concerning the consolidated accounts in accordance with IFRS as adopted ----- the administration of the company’s aff airs. This includes among other things continuous assessment of the company’s and the group’s fi nancial situation and ensuring that the company’s organization is designed so that the accounting, management of assets and the company’s fi nancial aff airs otherwise are controlled in a reassuring manner. The Managing Director shall manage the ongoing administration according to the Board of Directors’ guidelines and instructions and among other matters take measures that are necessary to fulfi ll the company’s accounting in accordance with law and handle the management of assets in a reassuring manner. Auditor’s responsibility Our objective concerning the audit of the administration, and thereby our opinion about discharge from liability, is to obtain audit evidence to assess with a reasonable degree of assurance whether any member of the Board of Directors or the Managing Director in any material respect: - has undertaken any action or been guilty of any omission which can give rise to liability to the company, or - in any other way has acted in contravention of the Companies Act, the Annual Accounts Act or the Articles of Association. Our objective concerning the audit of the proposed appropriations of the company’s profi t or loss, and thereby our opinion about this, is to assess with reasonable degree of assurance whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect actions or omissions that can give rise to liability to the company, or that the proposed appropriations of the company’s profi t or loss are not in accordance with the Companies Act. As part of an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. The examination of the administration and the proposed appropriations of the company’s profi t or loss is based primarily on the audit of the accounts. Additional audit procedures performed are based on our professional judgment with starting point in risk and materiality. This means that we focus the examination on such actions, areas and relationships that are material for the operations and where deviations and violations would have particular importance for the company’s situation. We examine and test decisions undertaken, support for decisions, actions taken and other circumstances that are relevant to our opinion concerning discharge from liability. As a basis for our opinion on the Board of Directors’ proposed appropriations of the company’s profi t or loss we examined the Board of Directors’ reasoned statement and a selection of supporting evidence in order to be able to assess whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act. Ernst & Young AB, Box 7850, SE-103 99 Stockholm, was appointed auditor of Intrum AB (publ) by the general meeting of the shareholders on the 6 May 2020 and has been the company’s auditor since the 25 April 2012. Stockholm 29 March 2021 Ernst & Young AB Jesper Nilsson sible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of annual accounts and consolidated accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the assessment of the company’s and the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They disclose, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis of accounting is however not applied if the Board of Directors and the Managing Director intends to liquidate the company, to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Audit Committee shall, without prejudice to the Board of Director’s responsibilities and tasks in general, among other things oversee the company’s fi nancial reporting process. Auditor’s responsibility Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to infl uence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these annual accounts and consolidated accounts. As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. - Obtain an understanding of the company’s internal control relevant to our audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the eff ectiveness of the company’s internal control. - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors and the Managing Director. - Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ and the Managing Director’s use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. We also draw a conclusion, based on the audit evidence obtained, as to whether any material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signifi cant doubt on the company’s and the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the annual accounts and consolidated accounts or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion about the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report However future events or conditions may - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, including the disclosures, and whether the annual accounts and consolidated accounts represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. - Obtain suffi cient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the fi nancial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated accounts. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our opinions. We must inform the Board of Directors of, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit. We must also inform of signifi cant audit fi ndings during our audit, including any signifi cant defi ciencies in internal control that we identifi ed. We must also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most signifi cance in the audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, including the most important assessed risks for material misstatement, and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in the auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes disclosure about the matter. Report on other legal and regulatory requirements Opinions In addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, we have also audited the administration of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director of Intrum AB (publ) for the year 2020 and the proposed appropriations of the company’s profi t or loss. We recommend to the general meeting of shareholders that the profi t be appropriated (loss be dealt with) in accordance with the proposal in the statutory administration report and that the members of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director be discharged from liability for the fi nancial year. Basis for opinions We conducted the audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities section. We are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfi lled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director The Board of Directors is responsible for the proposal for appropriations of the company’s profi t or loss. At the proposal of a dividend, this includes an assessment of whether the dividend is justifi able considering the requirements which the company’s and the group’s type of operations, size and risks place on the size of the parent company’s and the group’s equity, consolidation requirements, liquidity and position in general. ----- ###### Audited Financial Statements of Intrum AB (publ) as of and

The address of the Company’s headquarters is Hesselmans Torg 14, Nacka, SE–105 24 Stockholm, Sweden. During 2019, the Company was listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm, Large Cap list. The consolidated accounts were approved for publication by the Company’s Board of Directors on 1 April 2020. The balance sheets and income statements will be presented to the Annual General Meeting on 6 May 2020. The Parent Company’s functional currency is Swedish kronor (SEK), which is also the reporting currency for the Parent Company and for the Group. The financial statements are therefore presented in SEK. All amounts, unless indicated otherwise, are rounded off to the nearest SEK M. The consolidated and annual accounts pertain to 1 January – 31 December for income statement items and 31 December for balance sheet items. Accounting standards applied With regard to the consolidated financial statements, the Annual Report for Intrum AB (publ) has been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The Group applies IFRS as adopted by the European Union (EU). For 2018 and 2019, there are no new accounting standards relevant to Intrum in the IFRS issued by the IASB that have not yet been adopted by the EU. This means that the Group’s application of IFRS as adopted by the EU during the year also corresponds to the application of IFRS as issued by the IASB. Further, recommendation RFR 1 Supplementary accounting rules for groups from the Swedish Financial Reporting Board has been applied. The Parent Company applies the same accounting principles as the Group except in the cases stated in the section “Parent Company accounting principles”. Assumptions Assets and liabilities are recognised at historical cost, with the exception of certain financial assets and liabilities, which are measured at fair value. The preparation of financial reports in accordance with IFRS requires the Board of Directors and Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the accounting principles and the carrying values of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and a number of other factors that under current circumstances seem reasonable. The result of these estimates and assumptions is then used to determine the carrying values of assets and liabilities that otherwise are not clearly indicated by other sources. Actual outcomes may deviate from these estimates and assumptions. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed regularly. Changes in estimates are recognised in the period in which the change is made, provided it has affected only this period, or the period the change was made and future periods if the change affects both current and future periods. Estimates made by the Company that have a significant impact on the financial statements and estimates, which could necessitate significant adjustments in financial statements in subsequent years, are described in more detail in Note 36. The accounting principles described below for the Group have been applied consistently for all periods in the Group’s financial statements, unless otherwise indicated. The Group’s accounting principles have been applied consistently in the consolidation of the Parent Company, subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures. Changes in accounting principles _Accounting standards that entered into force in 2019_ The Group applies IFRS 16 Leases as of 2019. IFRS 16 stipulates that for both financial and operational leases of significance, a right of use asset and a lease liability are to be recognised. The exception is short-term leases and lease agreements for lower-value assets, for which lease fees are expensed on a straight-line basis. The right of use asset is recognised with linear amortisation over the term of the contract or the assessed financial lifetime of the asset, whichever is shorter. The lease liability is recognised including interest expenses in accordance with the effective interest rate method. The introduction of IFRS 16 entails lease liabilities being recognised for lease agreements previously classified as operational leases in accordance with IAS 17. These liabilities are valued at the present value of the future minimum lease payments, discounted at the marginal loan rate. Intrum applied the modified retroactive method, meaning that the effect of introducing IFRS 16 was recognised directly against the opening balance without the comparison figures being recalculated. The principal effects on Intrum’s accounting were that the Group’s total assets increased by SEK 709 M, calculated as per the beginning of 2019, with both an asset and a liability being reported for leases in effect (and where the amount is updated annually), and with operating earnings improving over the first year by SEK 43 M annually through the implicit interest expense in the leases being reported in net financial items rather than in operating earnings. Leases of low value (assets that, in new condition, have a value of less than approximately SEK 50,000) – primarily comprising IT and office equipment – are not included in the leasing debt but continues to be expensed on a straight-line bases over the lease term. Accordingly, the amended accounting relates mainly to rented office premises and cars. Intrum applies IFRIC 23 — Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments, from 1 January 2019. IFRIC 23 requires that a reservation be made, based on a probability assessment, for all tax risks where it is probable that the tax authorities, in the event of a full review, would disagree with the Company’s assessment. In conjunction with the introduction of IFRIC 23, Intrum has increased its provisions for potential tax disputes attributable to intra-Group transactions. The effect is an increase of SEK 155 M in the Group’s income tax liabilities, which is reported directly against the opening balance without the comparison figures being translated. Other changes to IFRS are not expected to have any material effect on the consolidated accounts. Classification issues Fixed assets and long-term liabilities in the Parent Company and the Group consist of amounts that are expected to be recovered or paid more than twelve months after the balance sheet date. Current assets and current liabilities in the Parent Company and the Group consist of amounts that are expected to be recovered or paid within twelve months of the balance sheet date. Consolidation _In subsidiaries_ The Group applies IFRS 3 Business combinations and IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements. The consolidated accounts include the annual accounts of all subsidiaries, i.e., companies in which the Parent Company, directly or indirectly, holds more than 50 percent of the votes or otherwise can exercise control over operations. A controlling interest is achieved when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from, its commitment to the Company and is able to affect returns by means of its decisive influence. An influence arises when the Group has existing rights enabling it to control the relevant operations, that is, the operations that significantly affect the Company’s performance. The consolidated accounts are prepared according to the acquisition method, which means that the acquisition of a subsidiary is treated as a transaction where the Group indirectly acquires the subsidiary’s assets and takes over its liabilities and contingent liabilities. The Group’s equity therefore includes only the portion of the subsidiary’s equity added since acquisition. The Group’s cost is determined through an acquisition analysis in connection with the acquisition. The analysis determines the cost of the shares or operations as well as the fair value of acquired, identifiable assets and assumed liabilities and contingent liabilities. The cost of the subsidiary’s shares or operations consists of the fair value of the compensation on the transfer date and transaction expenses directly attributable to the acquisition. The cost includes conditional purchase considerations recognised as liabilities at fair value per the acquisition date. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. In acquisitions where the cost exceeds the net value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities and contingent liabilities, the difference is reported as goodwill. When the difference is negative, it is recognised directly through profit or loss. Non-controlling interests arise in cases where the acquisition does not relate to the entire subsidiary. There are two options for recognising non-controlling interests. The two options are to recognise the percentage of non-controlling interests that makes up proportional net assets, or to recognise non-controlling interests at fair value, which means that non-controlling interests form a percentage of goodwill. The method used for recognising non-controlling interests is made on a case by case basis. The financial reports of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated accounts from the acquisition date until control ceases. ----- Intra-Group receivables and liabilities, revenue and expenses, and unrealised gains and losses that arise from transactions within the Group are eliminated in their entirety in the consolidated accounts. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associated companies and joint ventures are eliminated to a degree corresponding to the Group’s ownership of those companies. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, to the extent there is an indication of impairment. Associated companies and joint ventures The Group applies IAS 28 Investments in associates and joint ventures, and IFRS 11 Joint arrangements. Associated companies are companies that are not subsidiaries but where the Parent Company, directly or indirectly, has at least 20 percent of the votes or otherwise exercises significant influence without having control over the partly owned company. Participations in associated companies and joint ventures are recognised in the consolidated accounts according to the equity method, which means that the holding in the company is recognised at cost and subsequently adjusted to the Group’s share of the change in the associated company’s net assets. The value of the shares includes goodwill from the acquisition. The consolidated income statement includes the Group’s participation in the company’s earnings less goodwill impairment. The amount is reported under Participations in the earnings of associates and joint ventures. Dividends received from the company are not recognised in the income statement and instead reduce the carrying value of the investment. Any difference between the cost of an acquisition and the owner’s share of the net fair value of the associated company’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised in accordance with IFRS 3. The equity method is applied from the date a significant influence arises until the time it ceases or the associated company becomes a subsidiary. If the Group’s share of reported losses in the company exceeds the carrying value of its participations, the value of those participations is reduced to nil. Losses can also be offset against the Group’s unsecured receivables from the company if they constitute part of the net investment. Further losses are not recognised provided the Group has not issued guarantees to cover them. _Joint ventures_ The Group applies IFRS 11 Joint arrangements. Joint arrangements pertain to companies in which Intrum and other part-owners manage operations jointly in accordance with a shareholder agreement. Joint arrangements classified as joint ventures are reported in the consolidated accounts in accordance with the equity method. Joint ventures are companies in which the Group, through collaborative agreements, shares a controlling interest with one or more parties, such that the Group is entitled to net assets rather than having a direct entitlement to assets and responsibility for liabilities. Jointly owned companies are recognised at cost and subsequently adjusted for the Group’s share of the change in the company’s net assets. The consolidated income statement includes the Group’s share of earnings, and this is reported under Participations in the earnings of associates and joint ventures. Dividends received from joint ventures are not recognised in the income statement and instead reduce the carrying value of the investment. The equity method is applied from the date on which joint control is gained until the date that it ceases or transitions to the sole influence of Intrum. Shared operations, usually conducted in a company format, are joint arrangements in which Intrum and one or more partners are entitled to all of the financial benefits related to the assets of the operations. Shared operations are reported according to the profit split method, meaning that each party to a joint venture reports its share of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Foreign currency The Group applies IAS 21 Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. Transactions in foreign currency Group companies prepare their accounts in the local functional currency in the country where they have their operations. Transactions in a currency other than the local currency are recognised at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction day. When such transactions are offset or settled, the exchange rate may deviate from the one that applied on the transaction day, in which case a (realised) exchange rate difference arises. Moreover, monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are translated at the exchange rates on each balance sheet date, due to which an (unrealised) exchange rate difference arises. Both realised and unrealised exchange rate differences of this type are recognised in the income statement – in the operating result if, for example, they refer to accounts receivable or accounts payable, or in net financial items if they refer to financial investments and borrowing in foreign currency. To avoid exchange rate differences, receivables and liabilities in foreign currency are sometimes hedged through forward exchange contracts. The Group’s holding of forward exchange contracts is marked to market on each balance sheet date, and changes in value are recognised through profit or loss. _Translation of the financial statements of foreign operations_ Assets and liabilities in foreign operations, including goodwill and other Group surplus and deficit values, are translated from the functional currency to the Group’s reporting currency, Swedish kronor, at the exchange rate on balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated at the average rate, which serves as an approximation of the rate that applied on each transaction date. Translation differences arise in the translation of subsidiary accounts in part because the balance sheet date rate changes each period and in part because the average rate deviates from balance sheet date rate. Translation differences are recognised directly in total comprehensive income as the year’s change in the translation reserve. Long-term receivables and liabilities between the Parent Company and subsidiaries can be seen as an extension or reduction of the net investment in each company. If this is the case, translation differences are recognised under other comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements. When foreign operations are sold, accumulated translation differences attributable to those operations are realised. The Group has hedged certain cash flows in a foreign currency by entering into a series of forward exchange contracts. The effects of market valuation of the forward exchange contracts are initially reported in other comprehensive income, but are recognised in operating profit in pace with the reporting of the planned underlying cash flows. Financial assets and liabilities The Group applies IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. A financial instrument is any form of agreement giving rise to a financial asset in a company and a financial liability or equity instrument in a counterparty. Financial instruments recognised in the balance sheet include, on the asset side, cash and bank balances, accounts receivable and other equity instruments, loans receivable, portfolio investments and derivatives. Client funds are recognised on a separate line in the balance sheet and therefore are not included in the Group’s reported liquid assets. Included among liabilities and equity are accounts payable, client funds payable, debt and equity instruments in issue, loan liabilities and derivatives. On initial recognition, financial assets (except accounts receivable with no significant financing component) and financial liabilities are valued at fair value plus (in the case of financial instruments not measured at fair value via the income statement) transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition or issue. Accounts receivable with no significant financing component are valued at the transaction price. On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as valued at amortised cost, fair value via other comprehensive income or at fair value via the income statement. Financial assets are not reclassified after initial recognition, unless the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets, in which case all of the financial assets concerned are reclassified from the first day of the reporting period commencing after the change in business model. A financial asset or financial liability is recognised in the balance sheet when the Company becomes party to the instrument’s contractual terms. Receivables are recognised when the Company has performed and there is a contractual obligation on the counterparty to pay, even if an invoice has not yet been received. Accounts receivable are recognised in the balance sheet when an invoice has been sent. Liabilities are recognised when the counterparty has performed and there is a contractual obligation to pay, even if an invoice has not yet been received. Trade accounts payable are recognised when an invoice is received. A financial asset is removed from the balance sheet when the rights in the agreement are realised, expire or the Company loses control over them. A financial liability is removed from the balance sheet when the obligation in the agreement has been discharged or otherwise extinguished. The fair value of listed financial assets corresponds to their listed market price on the balance sheet date. The fair value of unlisted financial assets is determined by using valuation techniques, e.g., recently conducted transactions, the price of similar instruments and discounted cash flows. For forward exchange contracts and currency interest rate swaps, fair value is determined based on listed prices. The fair value of forward exchange contracts and currency interest rate swaps is calculated by discounting the difference between the contracted forward rate and the forward rate that can ----- be secured on the balance sheet date for the remaining contract period. The current value is obtained by discounting applying the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. For further information, see Note 34. _Portfolio investments_ Portfolio investments consist of portfolios of delinquent receivables purchased at prices significantly below the nominal receivable. Portfolio investments usually refer to receivables from private individuals and are often unsecured receivables. They are reported in accordance with the rules for acquired impaired (“credit-impaired”) receivables in IFRS 9, that is, at amortised cost applying the effective interest method and an effective interest rate reflecting the degree to which the receivable is impaired. The portfolios are attributable to the third stage of credit risk in accordance with the classification in IFRS 9. In the income statement, income from portfolio investments is recognised, in accordance with the effective interest rate method, as the collected amount less amortisation. The collection is often performed by the same personnel who handle collections and debt surveillance on behalf of external clients within the Credit Management service line. The cost of collection is debited internally at market price and expensed in the income statement for the Portfolio Investments service line as a cost of services sold. Reporting follows the effective interest method, where the carrying value of each portfolio corresponds to the present value of all projected future cash flows discounted by an initial effective interest rate determined on the date the portfolio was acquired, based on the relation between cost and the projected future cash flows on the acquisition date. Changes in the carrying value of the portfolios are comprised of amortisation for the period and are recognised in earnings as a deduction item in the calculation of income in accordance with the effective interest method. In connection with the purchase of each portfolio of receivables, a projection is made of the portfolio’s cash flows. Cash flows include the loan amount, reminder fees, collection fees and late interest that, based on a probability assessment, are expected to be received from end customers, less forecast collection costs. With this forecast and the acquisition price including transaction costs as a basis, each portfolio is assigned an initial effective interest rate that is then used to discount cash flows through the life of the portfolio. Current cash flow projections are monitored over the course of the year and updated based on, among other things, achieved collection results, agreements reached with end-customers on instalment plans and macroeconomic information, including forecasts of economic development and unemployment in each country. Cash flow projections are made at the portfolio level, since each portfolio of receivables consists of a small number of homogeneous amounts. On the basis of the updated cash flow projections and initial effective interest rate, a new carrying value for the portfolio is calculated in the closing accounts. The accounting model assumes each portfolio to be relatively homogeneous and comprising a large number of receivables for smaller amounts. Portfolios comprising individual larger receivables, generally receivables with underlying collateral in the form of properties, are valued on acquisition and at the level of the receivables in ongoing reporting over the lifecycle of the portfolio and not at the portfolio level. The Group applies internal application rules which mean that the initial effective interest rate can be adjusted in certain cases without a change in the carrying value of the portfolio for minor projection adjustments within a predetermined interval. Changes over time in the book value can be divided into an anticipated time and interest rate component (amortisation) and a component related to changes in estimates of future cash flows (revaluation). The effects of changes in cash flow forecasts, including changes in the anticipated financial lifetime of the portfolio, are referred to as revaluations and treated symmetrically, i.e., both increases and decreases in forecast flows affect the portfolios’ book value and, as a result, earnings. This means that certain portfolios may be valued at an amount higher than their cost. Although selling portfolios of purchased debt is not included in the business model, when such sales do occur as an exception, the resulting sales price received for the portfolio is reported in the same way as if it had been recovered from the end-customers. The entire remaining carrying values of the portfolios are recognised as amortisation. _Long-term receivables and other receivables_ Long-term receivables and other receivables are those that arise when the Company provides money without the intent to trade its claim. If the anticipated maturity is longer than one year they constitute long-term receivables, and if it is shorter they are other receivables. These receivables are recognised at amortised cost. _Accounts receivable_ Accounts receivable are recognised at the amount expected to be received after deducting impaired receivables, which are determined individually or according to statistical models based on historical experience in each country. Provisions are made for doubtful accounts receivable as the receivables arise, for expected losses, and are, if necessary, adjusted over the term of the claim. The anticipated maturity of accounts receivable is short, so they are carried at amortised cost without discounting. _Legal outlays_ The Group incurs outlays for court fees, legal representation, enforcement authorities, etc., which can be charged to and collected from end-customers. In certain cases Intrum has agreements with its clients where any expenses that cannot be collected from end-customers are instead refunded by the clients. The amount that is expected to be recovered from a solvent counterparty is recognised as an asset in the balance sheet on the line Other receivables. The anticipated maturity of these receivable is short, so they are carried at amortised cost without discounting. _Client funds_ Client funds, which are reported as assets and liabilities in the balance sheet, represent cash received on collection of a specific debt on behalf of a client and payable to the client within a specified period. Client funds are liquid funds with a restricted disposition right. The same amount is reported as a liability. _Cash and cash equivalents_ Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, as well as immediately available balances with banks and similar institutions. Short-term investments consist of investments with an insignificant risk of fluctuating in value, which can easily be converted to cash and have a maturity of not more than three months from acquisition. _Liabilities_ The Group applies IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. A financial liability is any form of agreement involving a commitment to deliver liquid funds or other financial assets to a counterparty, or that can be resolved by providing an equity instrument. Liabilities are initially recognised at the amount received following deduction of transaction costs. Subsequent to acquisition, loans are carried at amortised cost according to the effective rate method. Long-term liabilities have an anticipated remaining maturity of more than one year, while shortterm liabilities have a maturity of less than one year. The Group’s long-term loans generally have short fixed interest periods, which means that the nominal loan amount plus accrued interest is a good approximation of the liability calculated according to the effective rate model. _Accounts payable_ Accounts payable are valued at amortised cost. However, accounts payable have a short anticipated maturity and are carried without being discounting to a nominal amount. _Derivative instruments_ Derivatives consist of forward exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and currency interest rate swaps used to reduce interest and exchange rate risks attributable to assets and liabilities in foreign currency. Derivatives are also contractual terms embedded in other agreements. Embedded derivatives are recognised separately if they are not closely related to the host agreement. Forward exchange contracts are classified as financial assets or liabilities recognised at fair value via the income statement (held for trade) and assessed at fair value without deductions for transaction expenses that may arise on sale or similar. Hedge accounting is not needed for forward exchange contracts because the hedged item and the hedging instrument are carried at the price on the balance sheet date with changes in value recognised in the income statement as exchange rate differences. Changes in the value of operations-related receivables and liabilities are recognised in operating earnings, while changes in the value of financial receivables and liabilities are recognised in net financial items. Currency interest rate swaps are valued at fair value and reported in the balance sheet together with hedge accounting via Other comprehensive income. Currency interest rate swaps may be signed in connection with the Group issuing bonds in one currency that need to be exchanged to another currency to hedge net investments in foreign operations where the loan currency has been used in the operations. ----- _Hedge accounting with regard to exchange rate risk in the net investment in foreign subsidiaries_ Investments in foreign subsidiaries (net assets including goodwill) are to some extent hedged through loans in foreign currency or forward exchange contracts that are translated on the closing date to the exchange rate then in effect. Translation differences for the period on financial instruments used to hedge a net investment in a Group company are recognised in the degree the hedge is effective in total comprehensive income, while cumulative changes are recognised in equity (translation reserve). As a result, translation differences that arise when Group companies are consolidated are neutralised. Property holdings The Group applies IAS 2 Inventories. In connection with acquisitions of portfolio investments and in connection with the recovery of collateral for acquired receivables, Intrum may become owners of property holdings or other physical goods. They have been acquired for the purpose of being divested within the Group’s ongoing operations, and are therefore classified as inventories. These are reported in the balance sheet at cost or net realisable value, whichever is lower. When goods from these inventories are sold, the sales price received is recognised as income and the amount recognised as an inventory asset is reported among expenses for goods and services sold in the same period. Intangible fixed assets _Goodwill_ Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of an acquisition and the fair value of the acquired assets, assumed liabilities and contingent liabilities. If the Group’s cost of the acquired shares in a subsidiary exceeds the market value of the subsidiary’s net assets according to the acquisition analysis, the difference is recognised as Group goodwill. The goodwill that can arise through business combinations implemented through other than a purchase of shares is recognised in the same way. For business combinations where the cost is less than the net value of acquired assets and assumed and contingent liabilities, the difference is recognised directly through profit or loss. Goodwill is recognised at cost less accumulated impairment. The fair value of goodwill is determined annually for each cash-generating unit in relation to the unit’s performance and anticipated future cash flow. If deemed necessary, goodwill is written down on the basis of this evaluation. Intrum’s operations in each geographical region (Northern Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, Western and Southern Europe, as well as the Iberian Peninsula and Latin America) are, in this context, considered to be the Group’s cash-generating units. Goodwill arising from the acquisition of a company with a functional currency other than SEK is recognised as an asset in the functional currency and translated in the accounts at the balance sheet date rate. _Capitalised expenditure for IT development_ The Group applies IAS 38 Intangible Assets. Expenditures for IT development and maintenance are generally expensed as incurred. Expenditures for software development that can be attributed to identifiable assets under the Group’s control and with anticipated future economic benefits are capitalised and recognised as intangible assets. These capitalised costs include staff costs for the development team and other direct and indirect costs. Borrowing costs are included in the cost of qualified fixed assets. Additional expenditures for previously developed software, etc. are recognised as an asset in the balance sheet if they increase the future economic benefits of the specific asset to which they are attributable, e.g., by improving or extending a computer programme’s functionality beyond its original use and estimated useful life. IT development costs that are recognised as intangible assets are amortised using the straight-line method over their useful lives (3–5 years). Useful life is reassessed annually. The asset is recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Costs associated with the maintenance of existing computer software are expensed as incurred. _Client relationships_ Client relationships that are recognised as fixed assets relate to fair value revaluations recognised upon acquisition in accordance with IFRS 3. They are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life (5–10 years). Useful life is reassessed annually. The asset is recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. _Other intangible fixed assets_ Other intangible fixed assets relate to other acquired rights are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life (3–5 years). Useful life is reassessed annually. The asset is recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Tangible fixed assets The Group applies IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 40 Investment Property. Tangible fixed assets are recognised at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes the purchase price and costs directly attributable to putting the asset into place and condition to be utilised in the way intended. Examples of directly attributable costs are delivery and handling, installation, consulting services and legal services. Depreciation is booked on a straight-line basis over the asset’s anticipated useful life (3–5 years). Useful life is reassessed annually. Operational properties are properties that have been acquired to be leased to others or used within the Group’s operations rather than being sold. They are reported in accordance with the cost method, applying depreciation over the estimated useful life of the buildings. Additional expenses are capitalised only to the extent that they increase value in relation to performance on the date on which the property was acquired. No depreciation is applied for land. The carrying value of a tangible fixed asset is excluded from the balance sheet when the asset is sold or disposed of or when no economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal of the asset. The gain or loss that arises on the sale or disposal of an asset is comprised of the difference between the sales price and the asset’s carrying value less direct costs to sell. Gains and losses are recognised as other operating earnings. In connection with each closing date, a determination is made of each asset’s residual value and useful life. Tangible fixed assets are recognised as an asset in the balance sheet if it is likely that the future economic benefits will accrue to the Company and the cost of the asset can be reliably estimated. Leasing The Group applies IFRS 16 Leases. IFRS 16 stipulates that for leases of significance, a right of use asset and a lease liability are to be recognised. The exception is short-term leases and lease agreements for lower-value assets, for which lease fees are expensed on a straight-line basis. The right of use asset is recognised with linear amortisation over the term of the contract. The lease liability is recognised including interest expenses in accordance with the effective interest rate method. These liabilities are valued at the present value of the future minimum lease payments, discounted at the marginal loan rate. Taxes The Group applies IAS 12 Income Taxes. Income taxes consist of current tax and deferred tax. Income taxes are recognised in the income statement unless the underlying transaction is recognised directly in other total comprehensive income and in shareholders’ equity, in which case the related tax effect is recognised in other total comprehensive income and in shareholders’ equity. Current tax is tax that is to be paid or received during the year in question applying the tax rates applicable on the balance sheet date; which includes adjustment of current tax attributable to previous periods. Deferred tax is calculated according to the balance sheet method based on temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their value for tax purposes. The following temporary differences are not taken into account: temporary differences that arise in the initial reporting of goodwill, the initial reporting of assets and liabilities in a transaction other than a business combination and which, at the time of the transaction, do not affect either the recognised or taxable result, or temporary differences attributable to participations in subsidiaries and associated companies that are not expected to be reversed within the foreseeable future. The valuation of deferred tax is based on how the carrying values of assets or liabilities are expected to be realised or settled. Deferred tax is calculated by applying the tax rates and tax rules that have been set or essentially are set as of the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets from deductible temporary differences and tax-loss carryforwards are only recognised if it is likely they will be utilised within the foreseeable future. The value of deferred tax assets is reduced when it is no longer considered likely they can be utilised. Shareholders’ equity Share repurchases and transaction expenses are recognised directly against equity. Dividends are recognised as a liability after they are approved by the Annual General Meeting. Provisions The Group applies IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets. ----- A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or informal obligation owing to an event that has occurred and it is likely that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. The carrying amount for the provision is based on an assessment of the most likely outcome, and can be calculated by weighing the various possible outcomes and multiplying this by their estimated probability. Where it is important when in time payment will be made, provisions are estimated by discounting the forecast future cash flow at a pre-tax interest rate that reflects current market estimates of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks associated with the liability. A provision for restructuring is recognised when a detailed, formal restructuring plan has been established and the restructuring has either begun or been publicly announced. No provision is made for future operating expenses. A provision for termination costs is recognised only if the persons in question have known or presumed to have expected to be terminated by the balance sheet date. A provision is recognised for a loss-making contract when anticipated benefits that the Group expects to receive from a contract are less than the unavoidable costs to fulfil the obligations as set out in the contract. A provision for dilapidation agreements on leased premises is recognised if there is a contractual obligation to the landlord to restore the premises to a certain condition when the lease expires. Unidentified receipts and excess payments The Group receives large volumes of payments from end-customers for itself and its clients. There are instances where the sender’s reference information is missing or incorrect, which makes it difficult to allocate the payment to the right case. There are also situations where payments are received on closed cases. In such instances a reasonable search and attempt is made to contact the payment sender but, failing this, the payment is recognised as income after a certain interval. A provision is recognised in the balance sheet corresponding to the anticipated repayments of incorrectly received payments on a probability analysis. Contingent liabilities A contingent liability is recognised when there is a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by one or more uncertain future events or when there is an obligation that is not recognised as a liability or provision because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required. Impairment The Group applies IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. The carrying value of the Group’s assets, with certain exceptions, is tested on each balance sheet date for any indication of impairment. IAS 36 is applied in the impairment testing of all assets except financial assets, which are valued in accordance with IAS 9, investment assets for pension liabilities, which are valued in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits, and tax assets, which are valued in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes. If there is any indication of impairment, the asset’s recoverable value is estimated. For goodwill and other intangible assets with an indeterminate useful life and intangible assets not yet brought into use, recoverable values are calculated annually. If essentially independent cash flows cannot be isolated for individual assets, the assets are grouped at the lowest level where essentially independent cash flows can be identified, i.e., a cash-generating unit. Intrum’s operations in each geographical region are considered to be the Group’s cash-generating units in this regard. Impairment is recognised when the carrying value of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable value. Impairment is recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses attributable to a cash-generating unit are mainly allocated to goodwill, after which they are divided proportionately among other assets in the unit. The recoverable amount of cash-generating units is the higher of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Value in use is measured by discounting future cash flows using a discounting factor that takes into account the risk-free rate of interest and the risk associated with the specific asset. Impairment of goodwill is not reversed. Impairment of other assets is reversed if a change has been made in the assumptions that served as the basis for determining the recoverable amount. Impairment is reversed only to the extent the carrying value of the assets following the reversal does not exceed the carrying value that the asset would have had if the impairment had not been recognised Employee benefits The Group applies IAS 19 Employee Benefits. _Pension obligations_ The Group’s pension obligations are, for the most part, secured through official pension arrangements or insurance solutions. Pension obligations vary between countries on the basis of legislation and different pension systems. See also Note 21 for a further description. Defined contribution pension plans are plans where the Company’s obligation is limited to the fees it has committed to pay. The size of the employee’s pension depends in part on the fees the Company pays to an insurance company and in part on the return generated and actuarial factors. Consequently, it is the employee who assumes the investment risk and actuarial risk. The Company’s obligations for defined contribution pension plans are expensed through the income statement as they are vested by employees who render services on behalf of the Company. For defined benefit pension plans, the pension obligation does not cease until the agreed pensions have been paid. The Group’s net obligation for defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating future compensation the employees has earned in current and previous periods; this compensation is discounted to its present value. The discount rate is the interest rate as per the balance sheet date on high-quality corporate bonds, including covered bonds, with a maturity that, if possible, corresponds to the Group’s pension obligations. The calculation is performed by an actuary using the so-called Projected Unit Credit Method. The fair value of Intrum’s share of any investment assets as of the balance sheet date is calculated as well. Actuarial gains and losses may arise in the determination of the present value of the obligation and the fair value of investment assets. They arise either because the actual outcome deviates from previous assumptions or the assumptions change. All changes in value associated with such changes in assumptions are recognised in other comprehensive income. The balance sheet value of pensions and similar obligations is therefore equivalent to the present value on the balance sheet date less the fair value of assets under management. Pension costs for service in the current period are reported in the operating earnings, while the calculated interest expense on the pension liability and the interest income from assets under management are reported in net financial items. Pension obligations in Sweden that are met through pension insurance premiums to Alecta in the so-called ITP 2 plan are reported as defined contribution pension solutions. Borrowing costs The Group applies IAS 23 Borrowing Costs and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. Costs to secure bank financing are amortised across the term of the loan as financial expenses in the consolidated income statement by applying the effective interest method. The amount is recognised in the balance sheet as a deduction to the loan liability. The Group capitalises borrowing costs in the cost of qualifying assets, that is, fixed assets for substantial amounts with long periods of completion. No such investments have yet commenced. Revenue recognition The Group applies IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Intrum’s principal income derives from sales of collection services and from investments in portfolios of overdue receivables. Income from the collection services is reported in accordance with IFRS 15 and consists of collection fees, commissions, debtors’ fees and subscription income. Income from investments in portfolios of overdue receivables is reported in accordance with IFRS 9 and consists of income from the portfolios, calculated according to the effective interest method, as well as positive and negative revaluations. Revenue, consisting of commissions and collection fees, is recognised on collection of the claim. Subscription revenue is recognised proportionately over the term of the underlying service contracts, which is usually one year. Revenue from other services is reported when the service has been performed, at a particular point in time that is. In addition to income from collection services and investments in portfolios of overdue receivables, Intrum has certain other income, the most important of which is income from property sales and income from property services. In addition, Intrum has certain smaller sources of income from, for example, payment guarantees, credit information sales, customer account management, consulting services, factoring operations and VAT recovery services. Income from property sales refer mainly to sales of properties acquired together with portfolios of overdue receivables and properties pledged as collateral accruing to Intrum on the settlement of the claim. Income from property services is generated in a single country, where Intrum has companies that sell services to property owners, such as tenant administration, property valuations, key management and relocation of tenants. ----- Income from property sales and from property services are reported separately from other income in Note 2, as they are of greater importance in terms of their amounts than the smaller items in other income, and, where they are considered different from one another and from Intrum’s other income with regard to their terms, nature and risk. These are not usually reported separately in interim reports, presentations to investors or internal reports to the CEO, however. To a certain extent, Intrum owns properties that are to be sold within the ordinary course of business. The properties are usually acquired together with portfolios of overdue receivables, by taking possession of pledged assets or through acquisition at executive auction called for to liquidate pledged assets where Intrum is the creditor for the underlying receivable. The properties are reported as inventory assets applying the valuation rules in IAS 2. Sales of properties constituting inventory assets are reported gross, that is, the sales amount received is recognised as income in the income statement, while the reported value of the property is reported as cost of goods sold. Income from property sales is reported when the control passes to the buyer when the buyer gains access to the property. Financial income and expenses Financial income and expenses consist of interest income on bank balances and receivables and interest-bearing securities, bank fees, interest expenses on loans, dividend income, exchange rate differences, realised and unrealised gains on financial investments, and derivatives used in financial operations. Payment guarantees Intrum offers some of the Group’s clients the opportunity, against payment, to obtain a guarantee from Intrum regarding the clients’ receivables from their customers. The guarantee entails an undertaking by Intrum to acquire the receivable from the creditor at its nominal value, or a certain part thereof, once it has fallen overdue for payment by a certain number of days. The income, in the form of a guarantee fee, is recognised when the guarantees are issued, while a liability is recognised in the balance sheet for expected losses related to those guarantees. If the debtor fails to make payment, Intrum acquires the claim. The disbursement is then recognised as portfolio investments, less the liability recognised when the guarantee was issued. Cash flow statement The Group applies IAS 7 Cash Flow Statements. The cash flow statement includes changes in the balance of liquid assets. The Group’s liquid assets consist of cash and bank balances. Cash flow is divided into cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash flow from investing activities includes only actual disbursements for investments during the year. Disbursements for the purchase of portfolios of overdue receivables are reported under cash flow from investing activities, while the collection and repayment of such portfolios are reported under cash flow from operating activities. Foreign subsidiaries’ transactions are translated in the cash flow statement at the average exchange rate for the period. Acquired and divested subsidiaries are recognised as cash flow from investing activities, net, after deducting liquid assets in the acquired or divested company. Earnings per share The Group applies IAS 33 Earnings per Share. Earnings per share consist of net earnings for the year (attributable to the Parent Company’s shareholders) divided by a weighted average number of outstanding shares during the year. In this context, treasury holdings of repurchased shares are not included in outstanding shares. With regard to treasury shares that may be reissued in the future to fulfil commitments under the incentive programme for company management, no dilution effect is calculated until the vesting requirements of the incentive programme have been met. Segments The Group applies IFRS 8 Operating Segments. An operating segment is a part of the Group from which it can generate income and incur expenses and for which separate financial information is available. that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, i.e. the CEO in deciding how to assess performance and allocate resources to the operating segment. Intrum’s operating segments are the geographical regions of Northern Europe (Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Norway and Sweden), Central and Eastern Europe (Greece, Poland, Romania, Switzerland, Slova kia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary and Austria), Western and Southern Europe (Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK), as well as the Iberian Peninsula and Latin America (Spain, Portugal and Brazil). Central and joint expenses are spread across the geographical regions in proportion to their purchasing power parity-adjusted revenues. The break-down by geographical region is also used for internal monitoring in the Group. As of 2020, new operating segments will be applied: Credit Management Services (CMS), Portfolio Investments (PI) and Strategic Markets (Greece, Italy and Spain). Among other things, Note 2 details net revenue and operating earnings by geographic region. However, interest income, interest expenses, assets and liabilities are not reported by segment. This is not considered relevant because the distribution of financial items and parts of the balance sheet is dependent on Group structure and financing, which are not affected by the actual performance of the regions. Nor are actual reported interest income, interest expenses, assets and liabilities by segment included in any internal reporting to the CEO. Parent Company’s accounting principles The Parent Company has prepared the Annual Report according to the Annual Accounts Act (1995:1554) and recommendation RFR 2 Accounting for Legal Entities from the Swedish Financial Reporting Board. RFR 2 means that the Parent Company, in the annual report for the legal entity, must apply all EU-approved IFRS and statements as far as possible within the framework of the Annual Accounts Act and taking into account the connection between reporting and taxation. The recommendation specifies exemptions and additions relative to IFRS. As of 2019, Intrum has made a new interpretation of the rules in RFR 2 Accounting legal entities, entailing the Parent Company’s exchange rate differences attributable to the hedging of the Group’s exchange rate risk in foreign operations no longer being reported under Other comprehensive income but under Net financial items in the Parent Company’s income statement. Comparison figures for the preceding year were recalculated in the same way. The amended interpretation with regard to the Parent Company’s accounting has no impact on the consolidated financial statements. _Differences between the Group’s and Parent Company’s accounting principles_ The differences between the Group’s and Parent Company’s accounting principles are indicated below. The accounting principles for the Parent Company as stated below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the Parent Company’s financial statements. _Subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures_ Shares in subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures are recognised by the Parent Company at cost, including transaction costs less any impairment. Only dividends received are recognised as income. Credit risks in the Parent Company’s receivables from subsidiaries have been considered, showing no significant need for impairment. _Group contributions and shareholders’ contributions for legal entities_ The Company reports Group contributions and shareholders’ contributions in accordance with statement RFR 2 of the Swedish Financial Reporting Board. Group contributions received are recognised as dividends and Group contributions paid are recognised as shareholders’ contributions. Shareholders’ contributions are recognised directly in the shareholders’ equity of the recipient and capitalised in the shares and participating interests of the contributor, to the extent impairment is not required. _Other_ The presentation format for the Parent Company’s income statement and balance sheet follows the rules in the Annual Accounts Act, which deviate marginally from the consolidated presentation format in accordance with IFRS. The accounting rules for leasing in accordance with IFRS 16 that are applied in the consolidated accounts are also applied in the Parent Company’s accounts. Intrum has also made a new interpretation of the rules in RFR 2 Accounting legal entities, entailing the Parent Company’s exchange rate differences attributable to the hedging of the Group’s exchange rate risk in foreign operations no longer being reported under Other comprehensive income but under Net financial items in the Parent Company’s income statement. Comparison figures for the preceding year were recalculated in the same way. The amended interpretation with regard to the Parent Company’s accounting has no impact on the consolidated financial statements. ----- ###### Note 2 Information by geographical region and service line Information by geographic region and service line Group SEK M 2019 2018 Net revenues by geographical region from external Northern Europe 4,125 3,980 Central & Eastern Europe 4,862 3,790 Western & Southern Europe 3,519 2,564 Iberian Peninsula & Latin America 3,479 3,109 Total 15,985 13,442 Income from customers Northern Europe 2,683 2,650 Central & Eastern Europe 1,564 1,016 Western & Southern Europe 2,552 1,461 Iberian Peninsula & Latin America 2,569 2,113 Total 9,368 7,240 Income from portfolio investments in accordance with the effective interest method Northern Europe 1,428 1,330 Central & Eastern Europe 3,302 2,774 Western & Southern Europe 977 1,103 Iberian Peninsula & Latin America 910 995 Total 6,617 6,202 Total 15,985 13,442 Net revenues from external clients by country Spain 2,212 2,689 Norway 1,575 1,587 Italy 1,473 578 Hungary 1,434 1,197 Finland 1,061 1,026 Germany 940 857 France 940 1,019 Sweden 925 882 Other countries 5,425 3,606 Total 15,985 13,442 Intra-Group revenues by geographical region Northern Europe 360 336 Central & Eastern Europe 804 737 Western & Southern Europe 409 372 Iberian Peninsula & Latin America 312 267 Elimination –1,885 –1,711 Total 0 0 Operating earnings by geographical region Northern Europe 1,206 1,294 Central & Eastern Europe 1,965 1,377 Western & Southern Europe 1,464 228 Iberian Peninsula & Latin America –2,575 1,079 Total operating earnings 2,060 3,978 Net financial items –1,921 –1,364 Profit before tax 139 2,615 Assets by country Norway 9,742 9,359 Spain 9,275 10,382 Italy 5,894 5,909 Germany 3,877 3,788 Greece 3,764 51 France 1,537 1,490 Finland 1,259 1,213 Other countries 5,990 5,484 Total 41,338 37,674 Group SEK M 2019 2018 Investments in tangible and intangible fixed assets Northern Europe 79 78 Central & Eastern Europe 72 65 Western & Southern Europe 36 74 Iberian Peninsula & Latin America 164 22 Group-wide/eliminations 176 56 Total 527 296 Amortisation/depreciation, impairment including goodwill Northern Europe –228 –93 Central & Eastern Europe –222 –97 Western & Southern Europe –360 –94 Iberian Peninsula & Latin America –3,354 –520 Group-wide/eliminations –121 –96 Total –4,285 –900 Goodwill impairment Iberian Peninsula & Latin America –2,700 Total –2,700 – Not included in cash flow Northern Europe 69 –27 Central & Eastern Europe 106 –32 Western & Southern Europe –1,215 –122 Iberian Peninsula & Latin America 62 –206 Group-wide/eliminations –80 36 Total –1,058 –351 Participations in associated companies Northern Europe 0 Central & Eastern Europe 0 Western & Southern Europe 1,248 106 Iberian Peninsula & Latin America –69 Group-wide/eliminations 0 Total 1,179 106 Net revenues from external clients by service line Credit Management 9,368 7,240 Financial Services 6,617 6,202 Total 15,985 13,442 Net revenues by service line Credit Management 11,450 9,480 Financial Services 7,069 6,394 Elimination of inter-service line revenue –2,534 –2,432 Total 15,985 13,442 Operating earnings by service line Credit Management –415 2,433 Financial Services 4,961 3,600 Central expenses –2,486 –2,055 Total 2,060 3,978 No individual customer is responsible for generating more than 4 percent of total consolidated revenue.

The break-down by geographical region is also used for internal monitoring in the Group. Intra-Group sales between the regions are made on commercial terms. Internal transactions between the business areas Financial Services and ----- Credit Management Services relate to payment on commercial terms for work carried out within Credit Management regarding handling and collection of the Group’s purchased debt. Payment is made in the form of a commission that is recognised as a cost within purchased debt, but which is eliminated in the Consolidated Income Statement. Interest income and expenses are not reported by segment. This is not considered relevant because the distribution of financial items is dependent on Group structure and financing and is not affected by the actual performance of the regions.

The Group has operations in more than 20 countries in Europe, with various tax rates. The current tax expense for the year relates mainly to income taxes in Finland, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Germany and Hungary. The Group’s Swedish companies paid no income tax for the relevant year as they were able to utilise tax-loss carryforwards from historic losses, as well as from the loss for the year attributable to interest expenses and exchange rate losses. Intrum AB is seated in Sweden where the nominal corporate tax rate is 21.4 percent. The following reconciliation explains the difference between the Group’s actual tax cost and the expected tax cost taking the Swedish corporate tax rate into account: Group 2019 2018 Reconciliation of effective tax rate SEK M % SEK M % Profit before tax 139 2,615 Income tax calculated at –29.7 21.4 –575 22.0 standard rate in Sweden, 21.4 percent Effect of different tax rates in –115 82.8 121 –4.6 other countries Tax effect of tax-exempt income –561 404.5 –48 1.8 and non-deductible expenses Unrecognised tax assets pertaining to tax-loss carryforwards Utilised previously unrecognised tax assets pertaining to tax-loss carryforwards –70 50.3 –82 3.1 375 –270.6 14 –0.5 Group 2019 2018 Asset/ Income/ Asset/ Income/ SEK M liability expense liability expense Portfolio investments –1,538 –1,509 Intangible assets –288 –558 Tax-loss carryforwards 1,193 935 Provisions for pensions 49 17 Other –54 6 Total –638 176 –1,109 –112 Deferred tax assets 1,300 620 Deferred tax liabilities –1,938 –1,729 Total –638 176 –1,109 –112 The deferred tax assets and income tax liabilities are expected to be due for payment in over one year. Deferred tax assets are reported in the balance sheet, when it is expected to be possible to offset the loss carryforwards against taxable profits within the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reported net if they relate to the same tax authority or are planned to be utilised simultaneously. Intrum has reported net income in a foreign subsidiary in accordance with the so-called CFC taxation of earnings in foreign subsidiaries with low taxed income in the Swedish income tax returns. Income recognition has been based on accounting in accordance with Swiss law and a deferred tax liability has been recognised, attributable to temporary differences in the accounting period, which also affected the income statement . The income recognition will be adjusted in accordance with Swedish accounting rules, entailing a reduction in deferred tax liabilities for portfolio investments, which will partly be offset by loss carryforwards and an increased current tax liability. The Group has tax-loss carryforwards that can be utilised against future taxable surpluses totalling SEK 5.952 M (6.293). Deferred tax assets related to loss carryforwards amounted to SEK 1,193 M at 31 December 2019 and include SEK 854 M in Sweden, SEK 163 M in Norway, SEK 68 M in Spain, SEK 38 M in the Netherlands, SEK 36 M in Italy, SEK 18 M in the UK and SEK 15 M in Austria. As a consequence of the costs for the head office expenses and financing costs, the Parent Company has for several years incurred a tax deficit, even when taking in to account the Group contributions received from the profitable companies conducting business in Sweden. In accordance with CFC taxation and investments in profit participating notes in foreign subsidiaries liable for taxation in Sweden, the assessment is that the loss carryforwards can be utilised. Loss carryforwards for which no deferred tax assets are reported relate primarily to the UK with SEK 461 M, Denmark with SEK 44 M, Sweden with SEK 44 M and Italy with SEK 21 M. Tax expenses reported in other comprehensive income during the year amounted to SEK 174 M (79), of which SEK 175 M (81) pertained to currency hedging and SEK –5 M (–2) pertained to revaluations of pension provisions. The tax effect of implementing the new accounting principle/IFRIC 23 was SEK –154 M and is reported directly against shareholders’ equity. Parent Company 2019 2018 Reconciliation of Parent Company tax rate SEK M % SEK M % Loss after financial items –783 1,666 Income tax calculated at standard rate in Sweden, 21.4 percent 167 21.4 –367 22.0 Tax effect of tax-exempt income –72 –9.2 176 –10.5 and non-deductible expenses Adjustments to previous years –24 17.3 –29 1.1 and other Total tax on net earnings for the –424 305.7 –599 22.9 year Non-deductible costs are mainly attributable to goodwill impairment in Iberian Peninsula & Latin America. Unrecognised tax assets regarding tax-loss carryforwards relate to the negative tax effect during the year attributable to losses in countries where no deferred tax asset is recognised because it is not probable that enough taxable surplus will arise within the foreseeable future. Utilised previously unrecognised tax assets pertaining to tax-loss carryforwards relate to the positive tax effect over the year arising through the utilisation of tax-loss carryforwards never previously recognised as deferred tax assets. When differences arise between the tax value and carrying value of assets and liabilities, a deferred tax asset or tax liability is recognised. Such temporary differences mainly arise for portfolio investments, provisions for pensions and intangible assets. Deferred tax assets include the value of tax-loss carryforwards in the instances where they are likely to be utilised to offset taxable surpluses within the foreseeable future. Total tax on net earnings for the 96 12.2 –191 11.4 year Non-taxable income and non-deductible expenses in the Parent Company consist primarily of dividends from subsidiaries, as well as gains on disposals of shares. At the end of the year, the Parent Company had accumulated loss carryforwards of SEK 487 M (68). To the extent that it is expected to be possible to utilise them against future taxable surpluses, deferred tax assets are reported for these loss carryforwards in the amount of SEK 104 M (8).

The recoverable amount is determined through an estimation of its value in use. For each cash-generating unit, management has compiled a projection of annual future cash flows based on historical experience and the Company’s own plans and estimates for the future. The calculation is generally based on a detailed forecast for the years 2020–2022 and thereafter an annual increase of 1 percent. Exceptions are for Iberian Peninsula & Latin America where the assumption for the period after 2022 is an everlasting growth in cash flows that are essentially unchanged. The cash flows have been discounted to present value applying the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, which is estimated at 6.0 percent (6.2) per year before tax, corresponding to 4.2 percent (4.8) per year after tax. The recoverable amount has been compared for each unit with the Group’s net book value of the unit’s assets and liabilities. Impairment testing is based on a number of assumptions, where the outcome is judged to be most sensitive to some of those assumptions in particular: For 2021, annual revenue growth of 4 percent (4) is assumed, and for 2022, 4 percent (1), with each SEK 1,000 in increased revenue being assumed to result in an increase in working capital of SEK 250 (250), that is, an “incremental increase in earnings” of 25 percent (25). For the period after 2022, perpetual growth in cash flow of 1 percent (1) annually is assumed. Most of the assumptions were applied for all four geographical regions. The same discount rates were also applied, since no significant long-term difference can be identified between the regions’ growth potential or risk. With these assumptions, it was necessary to impair goodwill attributable to the Iberian Peninsula and Latin America region by approximately SEK 2.7 billion as a consequence of challenges in Spain and lower earnings levels compared to previous periods with other market conditions. There is no need for impairment for the other three regions. Sensitivity analysis A sensitivity analysis has been performed, in which cash flows have been discounted at 6 percent interest after tax. With this assumption, it was necessary to impair goodwill attributable to the Iberian Peninsula and Latin America region by approximately SEK 3 billion, in addition to the aforementioned approximately SEK 2.7 billion, and Western and Southern Europe approximately SEK 1.8 billion.

The VAT portion of the acquired receivable can be recovered from the tax authorities if it is not collected from the end-customer and is therefore recognised as a separate receivable. The portion that is expected to be recovered within 12 months is recognised as current. In the Netherlands, bailiffs are private companies and expenses for collection cases paid to them can sometimes be recovered from the bailiffs if their collection measures fail. When it emerges that Intrum is entitled to request that the amount be returned from the enforcement authorities, the amount is moved from Outlays on behalf of clients, to To recover from enforcement authorities. In the third quarter of 2019, Intrum reclassified a receivable as done in previious year to the acquisition cost for the ownership share in the joint venture and thus at a surplus value in the underlying assets. ----- ###### Note 18 Prepaid expenses and accrued income Group Parent Company SEK M 2019 2018 2019 2018 Prepaid rent 20 14 - Prepaid insurance premiums 4 4 1 2 Prepaid expenses for purchased 2 58 - debt Accrued income 984 480 - Derivative assets (forward 204 229 204 229 exchange contracts) Other 130 105 43 40 Total 1,344 890 248 272 ###### Note 19 Liquid assets Group Parent Company SEK M 2019 2018 2019 2018 Cash and bank balances 1,811 1,315 220 251 Restricted bank accounts 95 33 0 0 Total 1,906 1,348 220 251 ###### Note 20 Equity Share capital According to the Articles of Association of Intrum AB (publ), the Company’s share capital will amount to not less than SEK 1,300,000 and not more than SEK 5,200,000.

The statutory reserve is restricted equity and may not be reduced through distributions of earnings. _Share premium reserve_ When shares are issued at a premium, the amount exceeding their quota value is transferred to the share premium reserve. Provisions to the share premium reserve as of 2006 are non-restricted equity. _Fair value reserve_ Refers to unrealised exchange rate gains or losses on external loans in foreign currency, which are intended to hedge the Group’s translation exposure attributable to net assets in foreign subsidiaries. The fair value reserve is non-restricted equity. _Earnings brought forward_ Refer to retained earnings from the previous year less the dividend paid and share repurchases. Retained earnings are non-restricted equity. _Capital structure_ The Company’s definition of capital corresponds to shareholders’ equity including holdings without a controlling interest, which at year-end totalled SEK 24,893 M (25,672). The measure of the Company’s capital structure used for control purposes is consolidated net debt in relation to pro forma rolling 12-month-adjusted cash EBITDA, which at year-end amounted to 4.3 (4.3). This ratio is calculated by placing current consolidated net debt at the end of the year in relation to pro forma cash EBITDA, including operations being phased out and including a calculated cash EBITDA throughout the period for larger units acquired during the year, and excluding non-recurring items (NRIs). Net debt is defined as the sum of interest-bearing liabilities and pension provisions less liquid funds and interest-bearing receivables. The Board of Directors has established financial targets for the Group, in which net debt divided by pro forma rolling 12-month-adjusted cash EBITDA, as stated above, shall be between 2.5 and 3.5 in the long term ###### Note 21 Pensions Employees in Intrum’s companies are covered by various pension benefits, some of which are defined benefit plans and others as defined contribution plans. The Group applies IAS 19 Employee Benefits, which contains, among other things, uniform regulations on the actuarial calculation of provisions for pensions in defined benefit plans. Group employees in Switzerland, and certain employees in Germany, are covered by pension plans funded through assets under the management of insurance companies and are reported as defined benefit pension plans. Other employees in Germany and employees in Norway and Italy are covered by unfunded defined benefit pension plans that can be paid out as a one-time sum or as monthly payments following retirement. In France, the Company makes provisions for one-time payments made to employees on retirement, and these provisions are also reported according to the rules for defined benefit pension plans. In Belgium and Sweden, there are pension plans, funded through insurance, which theoretically should have been reported as defined benefit plans, but which are recognised as defined contribution plans since the Company lacks sufficient data to report them as defined benefit plans. See also below regarding the ITP 2 plan. Among other things, IAS 19 requires pension costs for service in the current period to be reported in the operating earnings, while the calculated interest expense on the pension liability and the interest income from assets under management are reported in net financial items. Actuarial revaluations are recognised in other comprehensive income. Provisions for pensions reported in the balance sheet can be analysed as follows: Group SEK M 2019 2018 Present value of fully or partly funded obligations 555 321 Fair value of plan assets -266 –253 Deficit in the plan 289 68 Present value of unfunded obligations 98 195 Total provisions for pensions 387 263 Changes in net obligation: Group SEK M 2019 2018 Opening balances 263 175 Expenses for employment in current year 21 15 Interest expense 3 5 Pensions paid -33 –19 Pension provisions in acquired operations 88 86 Revaluations 40 –8 Exchange rate differences 5 9 Closing balance 387 263 ----- Reconciliation of fair value of assets under management: Group SEK M 2019 2018 Opening balance 253 243 Fees paid 43 41 Compensation paid -44 –43 Interest revenue 2 2 Assets under management in acquired operations 0 0 Revaluations -7 –7 Exchange rate differences 18 17 Closing balance 266 253 The pension cost recognised in the income statement can be specified as follows: Group SEK M 2019 2018 Expenses for employment in current period 21 15 Net interest income/expense 3 5 Total pension expense in net earnings for the year 24 20 Costs for employment in the current period are reported in operating earnings. Net interest income/expense is reported under net financial items. Revaluations of the pension liability are included in other comprehensive income in the amount of SEK 8 M (negative 18) before tax. In calculating Provisions for pensions, the following assumptions are used: Group % 2019 2018 Discount rate 0.85-2.50 0.85–2.50 Assumed rate of increase in compensation 1.0-2.5 1.0–2.5 Assumed return on assets under management 1.0-2.0 1.0–2.0 Assumed pension increases 0.4-2.0 0.4–2.0 Future adjustment to social security base 2.0-4.2 2.0–4.2 The Group also finances a number of defined contribution plans, Consolidated expenses for these amounted to SEK 146 M (146). Funded defined benefit pension plans For Group employees in Switzerland, commitments exist in the form of obligatory service pension plans funded through insurance policies in the Swiss Life Collective BVG Foundation and in Transparenta BVG Foundation. The funded commitments currently amount to SEK 335 M (307), and the fair value of the assets under management is SEK 240 M (237). Consequently, the net pension liability is SEK 94 M (70). The pension commitment is funded through insurance contracts. During the year Intrum paid SEK 41 M (42) to the plan, while disbursements to retirees amounted to SEK 56 M (43). For Group employees in Norway, mandatory occupational pensions commitments exist that were previously secured through a funded defined benefit pension solution, although these were replaced in 2019 by an unfunded defined benefit solution and a defined contribution solution. ITP 2 plan The commitments for retirement and family pensions for the Group’s Swedish employees are secured through insurance with Alecta according to the so-called ITP 1 and ITP 2 plans. ITP 1 includes employees born in 1979 or later, while ITP 2 covers employees born in 1978 or earlier. ITP 1 is a defined contribution plan. On the other hand, according to a statement from the Swedish Financial Reporting Board, UFR 10, the ITP 2 plan is a multi-employer defined benefit plan. Alecta’s customers have not had access to such information for the fiscal year that would make allow them to report their proportional share of plan assets, liabilities and costs, preventing it from being possible to report the plan as a defined benefit plan. Nor is there a contractual agreement how surpluses and deficits in the plan are to be distributed among plan participants. The ITP 2 plan secured through insurance with Alecta is therefore reported by Intrum as if it were a defined contribution plan. The premium is individually calculated, depending on salary, previously vested pension and anticipated remaining term of employment. At year-end Alecta’s surplus in the form of the collective funding ratio was 142 percent (154). The collective funding ratio consists of the market value of Alecta’s assets as a percentage of the insurance obligations calculated according to Alecta’s actuarial assumptions, which do not conform to IAS 19. Under the provisions of the ITP 2 plan, measures must be taken if the funding ratio falls below 125 percent (for example, in connection with an increase in the price of the subscription) or exceed 155 percent (for example, in connection with a premium reduction). ###### Note 22 Other provisions Group SEK M 2019 2018 Opening balances 154 152 Amounts utilised during the year –99 –134 Unutilised amounts reversed during the year -65 -18 New provisions for the year 146 33 Provisions in acquired operations 29 114 Provisions in divested operations 0 1 Translation differences 3 6 Closing balances 168 154 Group SEK M 2019 2018 Of which, long-term provisions Expenses for returning leased office premises to their 0 2 original condition Personnel expenses 3 2 Rent and additional costs 16 1 Of which, short-term provisions Expenses for returning leased office premises to their 1 0 original condition Expenses for termination of personnel and other 91 0 restructuring expenses Additional purchase consideration for shares 0 138 Consulting (legal, tax and compliance) 2 11 Other 55 0 Total 168 154 Current provisions are expected to be settled within 12 months from of the balance sheet date.

In February 2019, the banking group was expanded to six and the limit to EUR 1,375 M. The loan framework of EUR 1,375 M can be utilised for borrowing in a number of different currencies. As of 31 December 2019, the loan framework had been utilised for loans in Swedish kronor totalling SEK 6,186 M (6,534), in euro totalling EUR 435 M (295) and in Norwegian kronor totalling NOK 1,550 M (3,000). The unutilised portion of the facilities amounted to SEK 8,178 M (4,241). The loan carries a variable interest rate based on the interbank rate in each currency, with a margin. All operational and financial covenants were fully met in 2019. In December 2019 a new agreement regarding a new syndicated loan facility of EUR 1,800 M was signed with a bank consortium of 14 banks. The facility has a duration of five plus one years and came into effect on 15 January 2020. In connection with this, the previous facility, agreed in June 2017, was annulled. The new loan facility contains operations-related and financial covenants, including limits on financial indicators. In addition, the new credit agreement includes covenants that may restrict, condition or prohibit the Group from incurring additional debt, making acquisitions, disposing of assets, making capital and finance lease expenditures, allowing assets to be encumbered, changing the scope of the Group’s business and entering into a merger agreement. During 2017, Intrum AB issued public bonds divided into four tranches of a total EUR 2,700 M and SEK 3,000 M. In 2018, Intrum issued a public bond for SEK 1,000 M. In 2019, Intrum issued an MTN bond of SEK 2,000 M, which was later increased by SEK 900 M. In November, Intrum issued another bond of ----- SEK 1,100 M, upon which the MTN programme was fully utilised. In addition, Intrum issued two bonds of EUR 800 M and EUR 850 M, respectively, the liquidity was used to repay two bonds with variable interest rates (EUR 300 M and SEK 3,000 M), and to reduce a fixed-rate bond by EUR 750 M, all of the earlier bonds had been issued in 2017 and were due to mature in 2022. In December 2019, a bond of EUR 75 M was issued with a maturity of five years and three months. Consequently, Intrum has outstanding bond loans for a total SEK 41,645 M (34,254). In 2019, Intrum also issued a commercial paper that, at the end of the year, amounted to SEK 2,794 M (2,123).

Pledged collateral also includes shares in subsidiaries within the Group pledged as collateral for the Parent Company’s revolving credit facility. The ----- reported value of pledged collateral in the table above refers to the consolidated value of the subsidiaries’ net assets. Payment guarantees The Group offers services whereby clients, against payment, obtain a guarantee from Intrum regarding the clients’ receivables from their customers. This entails a risk being incurred that Intrum must compensate the customer for the guaranteed amount in the event that the invoices are not paid on time. In those cases where the guarantee comes into play, Intrum assumes the client’s claim against its customer and takes over the continued handling of the case within the Portfolio Investments area of operations. At the end of the year, the total amount guaranteed was SEK 92 M (120). Intrum’s risk in this business is managed through strict credit limits and analyses of the borrower’s credit status. As of year-end Intrum had allocated SEK 1 M (1) in the balance sheet to cover payments that may arise due to the guarantee. Other In Spain, a number of disputes are in progress against two former executives, attributable to their termination in June 2015. The disputes concern whether the dismissals were unlawful, the former executives’ entitlement to different bonuses and the entitlement to compensation for one of the former execu ###### Note 26 Average number of employees tives for a competition commitment in his employment contract. Intrum has won all disputes in the lower court, with the disputes over illegal dismissal having gained legal force and can no longer being possible to appeal. The remaining disputes are currently being addressed by the higher court. Intrum refutes all of these claims. In Poland, a dispute is in progress related to the acquisition of Casus Finanse S.A. in 2015. The dispute concerns the entitlement of the sellers, the former management of Casus Finanse SA, to an additional purchase consideration and remuneration for continued employment under the share transfer agreement. The former management of Casus Finanse SA was dismissed in December 2016, and Intrum’s position is that no entitlement to an additional purchase consideration nor remuneration for continued employment applies. The dispute has been referred to the arbitration panel, which in December 2019 settled the dispute substantially in Intrum’s favour. Although there is a theoretical possibility for the counterparties to appeal against the arbitration panel’s ruling, the risk of a successful appeal is considered small. The possible effect on the Group’s earnings of the above disputes is not assessed to be significant, and Intrum has made provisions for the disputes in accordance with the anticipated outcome. The Group is otherwise involved in disputes in the normal course of business. In the opinion of the Board, none of these disputes are expected to give rise to any significant cost.

For information on compensation to the Group’s senior executives, see Note 28. ###### Note 28 Terms and conditions of employment for senior executives Guidelines on compensation for senior executives The 2019 Annual General Meeting adopted guidelines for remuneration to senior executives, the CEO and members of Group Management. The proposal has been prepared by the Board and its Remuneration Committee. _Salary and remuneration philosophy_ Intrum is dependent on its employees to achieve ambitious objectives in a challenging environment. The salary and remuneration philosophy seeks to ensure our employees are rewarded for their valuable contributions to the Company’s earnings. We also strive to be able to recruit, develop and retain high-performance employees in a competitive international environment. At the same time, we try to ensure that our employees are offered salaries in line with the market. Remuneration levels should reflect duties, responsibility and performance, and should be competitive compared with similar companies in similar sectors in the same geographic area. To ensure that appropriate behaviours are encouraged, and that efforts are focused in the appropriate areas, remuneration levels need to be related to the objectives closely associated with the Group’s business strategy and its core values. The total remuneration is based on four principal components: fixed salary, variable salary, long-term incentive programmes and pension benefits. Other benefits, such as a company car, may be offered as well. _Fixed salary component_ Fixed salary is set based on three perspectives: The complexity and responsibility of the post, individual performance and local market conditions. _Variable salary component_ Intrum’s variable salary component (VSP) serves to encourage short-term performance. It is set for one year at a time. The metrics are set individually for each member of Group Management to reflect the Group’s business strategy and priorities. The metrics reflect business targets or other generation of value for the Company. Short-term variable salary also entails the Company’s expenses varying depending on the Group’s financial development. Short-term variable salary is capped at 50 percent of fixed annual salary for the CEO and at between 35 and 50 percent for other members of Group Management. However, the Chief Risk Officer does not receive a variable salary component. _Long-term incentives_ Our long-term variable salary programme (LTIP) brings Group Management’s long-term interests and perspectives are brought onto an equal footing with those of shareholders, while commitment to the Company is also reinforced. This rewards long-term generation of value over a three-year period, allowing Group Management to participate in the Company’s financial success. Performance targets set by the Board of Directors in terms of the Group’s earnings per share (EPS) is generally applied as a metric because this is considered a good indicator of the Group’s long-term success. As with the variable salary component, an effect of the programme’s design is that the salary cost varies alongside the Group’s financial performance. The long-term incentive programme is proposed to be offered to Group management through the allocation of Performance Shares. The maximum allocation is 150 percent of fixed annual salary for the CEO, CFO and CIO and between 35 and 50 percent of fixed annual salary for other members of Group Management. The outcome of the long-term incentive programme is not pensionable. _Pension benefits, etc._ Retirement pension, disability and health insurance and similar benefits are to be designed to reflect the practices and requirements in the senior executives’ home countries. _Expenses for variable salary components and long-term incentive programmes_ For 2019, the expenses are expected to amount to at most SEK 19 M for the variable salary component and at most SEK 35 M for the 2019 long-term incentive programme, excluding social security contributions. The estimate does not take into account any changes in the composition of Group Management during the year. _Guidelines for individual share ownership_ It is proposed that the guidelines for individual share ownership, applied since 2015, be discontinued due to the share-based incentive programme established in 2018. _Other_ In the event of termination by Intrum, severance pay (if applicable) shall not exceed 12 months’ fixed salary. The Board of Directors shall have the right to depart from these remuneration guidelines if there is particular justification for doing so in individual cases. Role of the Remuneration Committee The Board of Directors has a Remuneration Committee whose task is to address the Group’s remuneration issues on behalf of shareholders and the Board. The Remuneration Committee is responsible for preparing the Group’s remuneration guidelines, which include general principles for how salaries and other remunerations are determined, as well as addressing remuneration issues concerning the CEO and Group Management. The Remuneration Committee comprises two Board members. Since the 2019 Annual General Meeting, the Remuneration Committee has consisted of Per E. Larsson (Chairman) and Magnus Yngen. The CEO and the Company’s Chief Human Resources Officer are co-opted to the Committee’s meetings, though not when their own remuneration is discussed. Terms of employment and remuneration of the CEO During 2019, Mikael Ericson, President and CEO, received remuneration in accordance with the Group’s principles as detailed above. In 2019, his fixed monthly salary was SEK 510,000, which was two percent more than in 2018. In addition to his fixed salary, he had the opportunity to receive 50 percent of his annual salary within the framework of the variable salary component and 50 percent of his annual salary within the framework of the 2017 long-term remuneration programme. In 2019, he was offered long-term incentives with an initial allocation of 150 percent of his fixed annual salary. In addition to his salary, the Company paid pension contributions corresponding to 35 percent of his fixed annual salary. The pension policy is a defined contribution plan and the retirement age is 65 years. He also had a company car in accordance with the Group’s car policy, as well as subsidised meals under the same terms as other Group employees in Sweden. Terms of employment and remuneration for other members of Group Management During 2019, other members of Group Management also had benefit levels in accordance with the Group’s principles as detailed described above. This includes fixed annual salary and the opportunity to receive 0–50 percent of annual salary within the framework of the variable salary component and, for former members of Intrum Justitia’s Group Management, 20–50 percent within the framework of the 2017 long-term remuneration programme. In 2019, they were offered long-term incentives with an initial allocation of 35–150 percent of their fixed annual salary. Pension benefits vary from country to country. In several cases, they are included in monthly salaries. Pension policies are defined contribution plans, and the retirement age is generally 65. Members of Group Management have company cars, in accordance with the Group’s car policy. Smaller benefits also occur according to local practice, such as subsidised meals and travel. In March 2017, certain senior executives, excluding the President and CEO, were offered an additional bonus, amounting to two or three months’ salary, linked to the merger between Intrum Justitia and Lindorff. Since the predetermined terms have been met, the exceptional bonus was paid out in March 2018. The variable remuneration for 2018 reported below includes the exceptional bonus, which was vested during the period 22 March 2017 to 31 March 2018. ----- The notice of termination for members of Group Management Team varies from three to twelve months, regardless of whether termination is initiated by the employee or the Company. Remuneration for the year Other senior executives in the table are defined as members of Group Management (see pages 50-51) other than the CEO.

According to the new accounting model, all contracts containing leases are to be recognised on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. If leases meet two criteria, 1) they are current leases (shorter than one year) and 2) they pertain to ”low-value assets”, such as personal computers, laptops, tablets, telephones, office equipment or other items where the purchase price is typically below USD 5,000 (or EUR 4,300), they are not covered by IFRS 16 and are therefore recognised as ongoing expenses as prior to application of IFRS 16. Leased items covered by IFRS 16 within Intrum are office premises, motor vehicles, ITC equipment and other leasing. The Company has implemented the leasing standard applying the simplified method (modified retroactive approach) and the transitional effects of IFRS 16 are reported as retained earnings as of 1 January 2019 without recalculating the comparative figures. The foremost effect on the consolidated financial statements derives from accounting for office premises. Prior to implementation of IFRS 16, Intrum’s leases were classified as operational and financial leasing. As of 2019, all of Intrum’s leases are instead reported as non-current assets and financial liabilities in the statement of financial position. Rather than reporting the leasing fee as an operating expense, Intrum reports depreciation and interest expenses under Total comprehensive income for the year. The right-of-use assets are depreciated over the term of the lease. The lease liability represents the present value of future lease payments. The change in right-of-use assets and lease liabilities since implementation is summarised below.

They are valued based on a valuation technique that uses observable market data and thus falls under Level 2 in the valuation hierarchy according to IFRS 13. Financial assets include the balance sheet items: purchased debt, other long-term receivables, accounts receivable, client funds, other current receivables, accrued income, derivatives with positive value, cash and cash equivalents and, for the Parent Company, intra-Group receivables. The total recognised value of consolidated financial assets amounted to SEK 36,039 M (30,109) on the balance sheet date. Financial assets amounted to SEK 35,835 M (29,507) and financial assets recognised at fair value via the income statement amounted to SEK 204 M (602). The total recognised value of the Parent Company’s financial assets amounted to SEK 37,604 M (35,909) on the balance sheet date. Financial assets amounted to SEK 37,400 M (35,880) and financial assets recognised at fair value via the income statement amounted to SEK 204 M (229). Financial liabilities include the balance sheet items: non-current and current liabilities to credit institutions, bond loans, commercial papers, client funds payable, accounts payable, advances from clients, other current liabilities, accrued expenses for the Parent Company, intra-Group liabilities. The total recognised value of consolidated financial assets amounted to SEK 56,647 M (47,469) on the balance sheet date. Financial liabilities recognised at amortised cost amounted to SEK 56,291 M (47,440) and financial liabilities recognised at fair value amounted to SEK 356 M (29). The total recognised value of the Parent Company’s financial liabilities amounted to SEK 51,702 M (50,573) on the balance sheet date. Financial liabilities recognised at amortised cost amounted to SEK 51,346 M (50,544) and financial liabilities recognised at fair value amounted to SEK 666 M (29). _Portfolio investments_ Portfolio investments consist of purchased debt reported at amortised cost according applying an effective interest rate model with an effective interest rate reflecting the risk of defaulted payment. Considering the purchased receivables are assessed to be in default they are classified to the third stage of credit risk as defined in IFRS 9. The Group determines the carrying value by calculating the present value of estimated future cash flows at the receivables’ original effective interest rate. Adjustments are recognised in the income statement. With this valuation method, the carrying value is the best estimate of the fair value of debt portfolios, in the Company’s opinion. On the balance sheet date, the carrying value of purchased debt amounted to SEK 28,508 M (24,830). An account of purchased debt by year acquired is provided in Note 33. _Accounts receivable_ Accounts receivable are recognised at amortised cost with no discount being applied since the remaining maturity is judged to be short. Accounts receivable amounted to SEK 1,860 M (719) on the balance sheet date. _Other receivables_ Other receivables have short maturities. Receivables in foreign currency are translated in the accounts at balance sheet date rates. Consequently, carrying value corresponds to fair value. Other receivables, including accrued income, amounted to SEK 3,764 M (3,211) on the balance sheet date. The item includes forward exchange contracts for SEK 204 M (229), recognised at fair value in the income statement. The remaining SEK 3,561 M (2,982) is valued at amortised cost. For the Parent Company, other receivables, including receivables from Group companies, amounted to SEK 36,825 M (35,857). The item includes forward exchange contracts for SEK 204 M (229), recognised at fair value in the income statement. The remaining SEK 36,622 M (35,628) is valued at amortised cost. _Cash and cash equivalents_ Liquid assets mainly consist of bank balances. Liquid assets in foreign currency mainly consist of bank balances. Liquid assets in foreign currency are translated in the accounts at balance sheet date rates. Consequently, carrying value corresponds to fair value. On the balance sheet date, cash and cash equivalents amounted to SEK 1,906 M (1,348). For the Parent Company, the corresponding amount was SEK 220 M (251) on the balance sheet date. _Liabilities to credit institutions_ The Parent Company’s and the Group’s loan liabilities carry market rate interest with short fixed interest terms. Liabilities in foreign currency are translated in the accounts at balance sheet date rates. Consequently, carrying value corresponds to fair value. On the balance sheet date, consolidated liabilities to credit institutions amounted to SEK 6,186 M (6,831) and for the Parent Company, they amounted to SEK 6,186 M (6,545). _Bond loans_ The Parent Company and the Group had bond loans outstanding for a value of SEK 41,644 M (34,254) on the balance sheet date. The bond loans are recognised at amortised cost. The fair value of the bonds, in accordance with observable market data, is SEK 42,479 M (31,606) and classified as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy according to IFRS 13 _Commercial papers_ The Parent Company and the Group had commercial papers outstanding for a value of SEK 2,794 M (2,123) on the balance sheet date. _Accounts payable_ Accounts payable have short maturities. Liabilities in foreign currency are translated in the accounts at balance sheet date rates. Consequently, carrying value corresponds to fair value. Consolidated accounts payable amounted to SEK 512 M (488). For the Parent Company, the equivalent amount was SEK 72 M (33). _Other liabilities_ The Parent Company’s and the Group’s other liabilities have short maturities. Liabilities in foreign currency are translated in the accounts at balance sheet date rates. Consequently, carrying value corresponds to fair value. Other liabilities, including accrued expenses amounted to SEK 5,588 M (3,773) on the balance sheet date. The item includes derivatives valued at SEK 356 M (29), recognised at fair value in the income statement (held for trade). Other liabilities, excluding derivatives amounted to SEK 5,233 M (3,744). For the Parent Company, other liabilities amounted to SEK 1,361 M (7,618) on the balance sheet date and included liabilities to Group companies and accrued expenses. Derivatives are recognised at fair value in the income statement (held for trade) and amounted to SEK 356 M (29). Other liabilities, excluding derivatives amounted to SEK 1,005 M (7,589). _Offset of financial instruments_ Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value comprise derivatives. Financial assets and liabilities are not offset in the balance sheet. However, there are legally binding agreements that allow offsetting should one of the counterparties for the Group’s derivatives suspend their payments. At the end of the year, Intrum had financial assets totalling SEK 29 M (29) that could be offset against debts should the counterparties suspend their payments. ###### Note 33 Financial risks and financial policies Principles of financing and financial risk management The financial risks that arise in Intrum operations are limited. Thanks to a strong cash flow, combined with little need for investment and operating capital, external capital needs in the Group’s Credit Management operations are relatively low. The purchased debt operations have a greater need for capital, particularly during a growth phase. Intrum’s financing and financial risks are managed within the Group in accordance with the treasury policy established by the Board of Directors. The treasury policy contains rules for managing financial activities, delegating responsibility, measuring and identifying financial risks and limiting these risks. Internal and external financial operations are concentrated in Group Treasury in Stockholm and Oslo, which ensures economies of scale when pricing financial transactions. Because Group Treasury can take advantage of temporary surpluses and deficits in the Group’s various countries of operation, the Group’s total interest expense can be minimised. Market risk Market risk consists of risks related to changes in exchange rates and interest rate levels. _Exchange rate risk_ Exchange rate risk is the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates will nega ----- tively affect the Group’s income statement, balance sheet and/or cash flows. The most important currencies for the Intrum Group, other than the Swedish krona (SEK), are the euro (EUR), the Swiss franc (CHF), the Hungarian forint (HUF) and the Norwegian krone (NOK). The following exchange rates have been used to translate transactions in foreign currency in the financial accounts: Average Average Currency 31 Dec 2019 31 Dec 2018 2019 2018 CHF 9.62 9.11 9.52 8.88 EUR 10.45 10.26 10.59 10.26 HUF 0.0316 0.0319 0.0326 0.0322 NOK 1.06 1.03 1.07 1.07 Exchange rate risk can be divided into transaction exposure and translation exposure. Transaction exposure consists of net operating and financial receipts and disbursements in different currencies. Translation exposure consists of the effects from the translation of the financial reports of foreign subsidiaries and associated companies to SEK. _Transaction exposure_ In each country, all income and most operating expenses are denominated in local currencies, and thus currency fluctuations have only a limited impact on the Company’s operating earnings in local currency. National operations seldom have receivables and liabilities in foreign currency. Income and expenses in national currency are thereby hedged in a natural way, which limits transaction exposure. The currency exposure that arises within the operating activities is limited to the extent it pertains to international collection operations. The subsidiaries’ projected flow exposure is not hedged at present. All major known currency flows are hedged on a continuous basis in the Group and the Parent Company through forward exchange contracts. _Translation exposure_ Intrum operates in some 25 countries. The results and financial position of subsidiaries are reported in the relevant foreign currencies and later translated into SEK for inclusion in the consolidated financial statements. Consequently, fluctuations in the SEK exchange rate affect consolidated income and earnings, as well as equity and other items in the financial statements. The Group’s revenues are distributed by currency as follows: SEK M 2019 2018 SEK 936 882 EUR 9,766 7,791 CHF 804 802 HUF 1,434 1,197 NOK 1,575 1,587 Other currencies 1,470 1,183 Total 15,985 13,442 An appreciation of the Swedish krona of 10 percentage points on average in 2019 against EUR would thus, all else being equal, have affected revenues negatively by SEK 977 M, against CHF by SEK 80 M, against HUF by SEK 143 M and against NOK by SEK 158 M. In terms of net assets by currency, shareholders’ equity in the Group, including non-controlling interests, is distributed as follows: SEK M 2019 2018 SEK 21,303 7,497 EUR 17,470 32,811 – less EUR hedged through foreign currency loans -27,151 -27,654 + EUR hedged through derivatives 8,817 5,817 CHF 530 1,581 – less CHF hedged through foreign currency loans -110 -31 – less CHF hedged through derivatives 0 -957 DKK -3 707 – less DKK hedged through derivatives -70 -438 HUF 2,460 2,494 – less HUF hedged through foreign currency loans 0 -516 – less HUF hedged through derivatives -1,896 -1,050 NOK 4,185 13,036 – less NOK hedged through foreign currency loans -3,760 -5,135 – less NOK hedged through derivatives 0 -4,221 Other currencies 3,118 1,732 Total 24,893 25,672 All else being equal, an appreciation in the Swedish krona of 42 percentage points as per 31 December 2019 against EUR would have affected shareholders’ equity in the Group positively by SEK 86 M, negatively against CHF by SEK -42 M, positively against DKK by SEK 7 M, negatively against HUF by SEK -56 M and negatively against NOK by SEK -42 M. Regarding the currency risk attributable to currency interest rate swaps, see the description below under Interest rate risks. The Group hedges part of its translation exposure by means of currency hedging measures, consisting of external loans in foreign currency and derivative instruments. Over the year, goodwill was excluded as a hedged balance sheet item, contributing to a change year-on-year in the table above. There is an economic relationship between the hedged balance sheet items and the hedging instruments, in which the efficiency of the hedge is tested and adjusted monthly. The effects of the translation exposure and hedging measures have opposite values (negative/positive) and are reported under Other comprehensive income. The hedging instruments amounted to SEK –41,645 (–34,185) at year-end. No inefficiencies were reported during the year regarding hedges of net investments in foreign operations. _Interest rate risks_ Interest rate risks relate primarily to the Group’s interest-bearing net debt, which amounted to SEK 49,105 M (42,122) on 31 December 2019. The loan rate is tied to the market rate. . Intrum has a strong cash flow which gives the Group the option of repaying loans or investing in portfolios. The Group’s loans have a fixed interest term – currently about 46 months (30) for the entire loan portfolio. A 1-percent increase in market interest rates during the year would have adversely affected net financial items by approximately SEK 397 M. A 5-percent increase would have adversely affected net financial items by SEK 1,986 M. To establish an appropriate matching of currencies in the balance sheet and thus manage the currency risk between assets and liabilities, the Company uses currency interest rate swaps in which the Parent Company swaps liabilities in SEK and receives EUR at the same rate on both the start and maturity dates. In this way, the Company can maintain the desired level of hedging of shareholders’ equity per currency while also maintaining an interest rate exposure in the same currency. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk of a loss or higher-than-expected costs to ensure the Group’s ability to fulfil its short and long-term payment obligations to outside parties. The Group’s long-term financing risk is limited by confirmed loan facilities. The Group’s objective is that at least 35 percent of total committed loans have a remaining maturity of at least three years and that not more than 35 percent of the total have a remaining maturity of less than 12 months. In December 2019 a new agreement regarding a new syndicated loan facility of EUR 1,800 M was signed with a bank consortium of 14 banks. The facility has a duration of five plus one years and came into effect on 15 January 2020. In connection with this, the previous facility, agreed in June 2017, was annulled. The new loan facility contains operations-related and financial covenants, including limits on financial indicators. In addition, the new credit agreement includes covenants that may restrict, condition or prohibit the Group from incurring additional debt, making acquisitions, disposing of assets, making capital and finance lease expenditures, allowing assets to be encumbered, changing the scope of the Group’s business and entering into a merger agreement. During 2017, Intrum AB issued public bonds divided into four tranches of a total EUR 2,700 M and SEK 3,000 M. In 2018, Intrum issued a public bond for SEK 1,000 M. In 2019, Intrum issued an MTN bond of SEK 2,000 M, which was later increased by SEK 900 M. In November, Intrum issued another bond of SEK 1,100 M, upon which the MTN programme was fully utilised. In addition, Intrum issued two bonds of EUR 800 M and EUR 850 M, respectively, the liquidity was used to repay two bonds with variable interest rates (EUR 300 M and SEK 3,000 M), and to reduce a fixed-rate bond by EUR 750 M, all of the earlier bonds had been issued in 2017 and were due to mature in 2022. In December 2019, a bond of EUR 75 M was issued with a maturity of five years and three months. Consequently, Intrum has outstanding bond loans for a total SEK 41,644 M (34,254). In 2019, Intrum also issued a commercial paper that, at the end of the year, amounted to SEK 2,794 M (2,123). The Group’s aim is that the liquidity reserve, which consists of cash, bank balances and short-term liquid investments should amount to at least SEK 100 M more than the unutilised portion of committed lines of credit. The Group has deposited its liquid assets with established financial institutions where the risk of loss is considered remote. The Group’s finance function prepares regular liquidity forecasts with the purpose of optimising the balance between loans and liquid funds so that the net interest expense is minimised without, for that matter, incurring difficulties in meeting external commitments. ----- The table below provides an analysis of the financial liabilities of the Group and the Parent Company broken down according to the amount of time remaining until the contractual maturity date. The amounts given in the table are the contractual, undiscounted cash flows. The amounts falling due within 12 months agree with the reported amounts since the discount effect is negligible.

Financial assets that potentially subject the Group to credit risk include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, portfolio investments, outlays on behalf of clients, derivatives and guarantees. For financial assets owned by Intrum, no collateral or other credit reinforcements have been received, with the exception of a certain portion of the Group’s portfolio investments. The maximum credit exposure for each class of financial assets corresponds to the carrying amount. _Cash and cash equivalents_ The Group’s cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of bank balances and other short-term financial assets with a remaining maturity of less than three months. The Group has deposited its liquid assets with established banks where the risk of loss is considered remote. _Accounts receivable_ The Group’s accounts receivable from clients and debtors in various industries, and are not concentrated in a specific geographical region. The Group’s largest client accounts for less than two percent of revenues. Most accounts receivable outstanding are with customers previously known to the Group and whose creditworthiness is good. For an analysis of accounts receivable by age, see Note 16. Of the total carrying value on the balance sheet date, 25 percent represents portfolio acquisitions in 2019, 20 percent acquisitions in 2018, 18 percent acquisitions in 2017 and 10 percent acquisitions in 2016. The remaining 27 percent relates to receivables acquired in or before 2015, which have therefore been past due for more than four years. In the case of a large share of the oldest receivables, Intrum has reached agreement with the debtors on payment plans. _Portfolio investments_ As part of its portfolio investment operations, Intrum acquires portfolios of consumer receivables and tries to collect them. Unlike its conventional collection operations where Intrum works on behalf of clients in return for commissions and fees, in this case it assumes all the rights and risks associated with the receivables. The portfolios are purchased at prices significantly below their nominal value, and Intrum retains the entire amount it collects, including interest and fees. The acquired receivables are overdue and in many cases are from debtors who are having payment problems. It is obvious, therefore, that the entire nominal amount of the receivable will not be recovered. On the other hand, the receivables are acquired at prices significantly below their nominal value. The risk in this business is that Intrum, at the time of acquisition, overestimates its ability to collect the amounts or underestimates the costs of collection. The maximum theoretical risk is of course that the entire carrying value of SEK 28,508 M (24,830) would become worthless and have to be written off. To minimise the risks in this business, prudence is exercised in purchase decisions. The focus is on small and medium-sized portfolios with relatively low average amounts, to help spread risks. The average nominal value per case is approximately SEK 19,895. Portfolios are normally acquired from customers with whom the Group has had a long-term relationship. The acquisitions have generally consisted of unsecured debt, requiring relatively less capital and significantly simplifying administration compared with collateralised receivables. Since 2016, however, Intrum has also begun to acquire portfolios with underlying collateral, usually in the form of property mortgages. Intrum places high yield requirements on the portfolios it acquires. Before every acquisition, a careful assessment is made based on a projection of future cash flows (collected amount) from the portfolio. In these calculations Intrum benefits from its extensive experience in debt collection and from the Group’s scoring methods. Intrum therefore believes that it has the expertise required to evaluate these types of receivables. To enable acquisitions of larger portfolios at attractive risk levels, Intrum has, on occasion, partnered with other companies such as Piraeus Bank and Ibercaja Banco to share the capital investment and return. The currency risk is attributable to the translation of the balance sheet item Portfolio investments is limited due to currency hedging using loans in the same currency as the assets, and currency forwards. A considerable proportion of the acquisitions take place through forward flow agreements – that is, Intrum may have previously agreed with a company to acquire all of that company’s accounts receivable at a certain percentage of their nominal value once they are overdue by a certain number of days. In most of these agreements, however, Intrum has the opportunity to decline to acquire the receivables if, for example, their quality decreases. Risks are diversified by acquiring receivables from clients in different sectors and different countries. The Group’s purchased debt portfolios include debtors in 24 countries. The Group’s total carrying amount for purchased debt is distributed as follows: Receivables by country Receivables by industry Spain, 15% (12) Norway, 13% (13) UK, 10% (7) Germany, 10% (11) Sweden, 7% (8) France, 6% (8) Other countries, 39% (41) Telecom companies, 5% (6) Bank sector, 63% (63) Credit card receivables, 11% (10) Other financial operations, 15% (14) Other segments, 6% (7) ----- _Outlays on behalf of clients_ As an element in its operations, the Group incurs outlays for court fees, legal representation, enforcement authorities, etc., which can be charged to and collected from debtors. In many cases Intrum has agreements with its clients whereby any expenses that cannot be collected from debtors are instead refunded by the client. The amount that is expected to be recovered from a solvent counterparty is recognised as an asset in the balance sheet on the line Other receivables. _Derivative contracts_ The Parent Company and the Group hold forward exchange contracts to a limited extent. The credit risk in the Group’s forward exchange contracts is because the counterparty generally is a large bank or financial institution that is not expected to become insolvent. On the balance sheet date, assets regarding forward exchange contracts were valued at SEK 204 M (229), and liabilities at SEK 356 M (29). See Note 33 regarding the possibility of offsetting receivables and liabilities for derivative contracts. The contracts have short maturities, typically one or more months. All outstanding forward exchange contracts are restated at fair value in the accounts, with adjustments recognised in the income statement. The purpose of these forward exchange contracts has been to minimise exchange rate differences in the Parent Company attributable to receivables and liabilities in foreign currency. Outstanding forward exchange contracts at year end in the Parent Company and in the Group comprise the following currencies: Currency Local currency, buy Hedged amount, sell CHF 68,500,000 0 CZK 675,000,000 0 DKK 116,000,000 -50,000,000 EUR 1,583,200,000 -30,500,000 GBP 7,000,000 -157,000,000 HUF 25,420,000,000 -500,000,000 NOK 250,000,000 -330,000,000 PLN 6,000,000 -188,000,000 RON 19,000,000 0 SEK 1,591,165,680 -19,132,747,088 The Parent Company and the Group also hold currency interest rate swaps that were signed in connection with the Parent Company’s issue of bonds in SEK. To achieve suitable currency matching between assets and liabilities, liabilities in SEK were exchanged to EUR at the same rate on the starting date and the date of maturity. _Payment guarantees_ The Group offers services whereby clients, against payment, obtain a guarantee from Intrum regarding the clients’ receivables from their customers. This entails a risk being incurred that Intrum must compensate the customer for the guaranteed amount in the event that the invoices are not paid on time. In those cases where the guarantee comes into play, Intrum assumes the client’s claim against its customer and takes over the continued handling of the case within the Portfolio Investments area of operations. At the end of the year, the total amount guaranteed was SEK 92 M (120). Intrum’s risk in this business is managed through strict credit limits and analyses of the borrower’s credit status. At the end of the year Intrum had allocated SEK 1 M (1) in the balance sheet to cover payments that may arise due to the guarantee. ###### Note 34 Acquisitions of operations In the cash flow statement, SEK 5,135 M (8,587) is reported as acquisitions of subsidiaries and joint ventures. In 2019, Intrum agreed with Piraeus bank to acquire 80% of the bank’s platform for management of overdue receivables for a cash payment of SEK 3,187 M and a possible deferred purchase price, which Intrum at the time of acquisition valued at SEK 310 M. In the second quarter, Intrum acquired 80 percent of the shares in the Spanish company Solvia Servicios Inmobiliaros for an amount of SEK 1,937 M. Intrum gained a controlling influence over the acquired company on 24 April 2019. For 2018, the amount relates to the acquisition of 51 percent of the shares in Intrum Italy Spa for an amount of SEK 1,883 M, the acquisition of 100 percent of the shares in Northwind Investment Holding Sl for an amount of SEK 1,787 M, the acquisition of Iplatform Consultoria e Participacoes SA for an amount of SEK 15 M, and the acquisition of profit participating notes in Ithaca Investment DAC for an amount of SEK 4,902 M (recognised as participations in a joint venture). Acquisition _Solvia_ During the quarter, Intrum acquired Solvia Servicios Inmobiliaros (Solvia) from Banco Sabadell. The acquisition entails Intrum acquiring 80 percent of the shares in Solvia while Banco Sabadell retains 20 percent. Solvia is one of Spain’s leading suppliers of real estate management services.

The transaction was completed in the fourth quarter, and the acquired business has been consolidated from the date on which Intrum gained a controlling influence, 1 October 2019. The operations have been separated from the bank and consolidated by Intrum in separate legal entities, in which Intrum has acquired 80 percent of the shares.

Management has discussed with the Audit Committee the Group’s critical accounting principles and estimates as well as the application of these. Estimates and assumptions are continuously assessed on the basis of historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events ----- considered reasonable under prevailing conditions. Actual outcomes may vary from the assessments made. The areas in which estimates and assumptions could entail significant risk of adjustment in the recognised amounts for assets and liabilities in future fiscal years are primarily the following: Impairment testing of goodwill As indicated in Note 10, an impairment test of goodwill was done prior to the preparation of the annual accounts. The geographical regions are judged to achieve a sufficient degree of integration that they form combined cash generating units. Recoverable amounts for cash generating units have been established by calculating their value in use. The assumptions and assessments made with regard to expected cash flows and discount rates in the form of weighted average cost of capital, as well as a sensitivity analysis are detailed in Note 10. Projections of future cash flows are based on the best possible assessments of future income and operating expenses. Portfolio investments As indicated in Note 14, the recognition of portfolio investments in overdue receivables is based on the Company’s own projection of future cash flows from the acquired portfolios. Although the Company has historically had good projection accuracy with regard to cash flows, future deviations cannot be ruled out. The Group applies internal rules and a formalised decision-making process in the adjustment of previously established cash flow projections. These entail, among other things, that cash flow projections are only in exceptional cases adjusted in the first year of ownership of a portfolio. Furthermore, an amendment of the cash flow projection normally requires an agreement between local management in the country in question and the Group’s risk department. All changes in cash flow projections are ultimately decided on by a central revaluation committee. Sales of portfolio investments The Group has occasionally sold certain portfolios of purchased debt. Divestments of portfolios are not included in the business model for this asset category. Intrum has assessed the transactions and concluded that a sale of purchased debt should be recognised in the same way as if an amount equivalent to the selling price had been collected as part of normal operations. For Intrum’s accounting, it does not matter if the same amount is received through collection from debtors or by sale to an external party. The entire sale price for the portfolios sold has been reported as the amount collected on purchased debt, and the entire carrying value remaining prior to the sale has been reported as amortisation of purchased debt. Useful lifetimes of intangible and tangible fixed assets Group Management establishes assessed useful lifetimes and thus consistent amortisation and depreciation for the Group’s intangible and tangible fixed assets. These estimates are based on historical knowledge of equivalent assets’ useful lives. Useful life and estimated residual values are tested on each balance sheet date and adjusted when necessary. Recognised values for each balance sheet date for intangible and tangible fixed assets, see Notes 10 and 11. Assessment of deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets for tax-loss carryforwards or other future tax deductions are recognised to the extent it is deemed likely that the deduction can be made against future taxable surpluses. Carrying amounts for deferred tax assets on each balance sheet date are provided in Note 8. Accounting of Polish investment funds The Group has operated in Poland since 2006 through investment funds designed for the purchasing and holding of portfolio investments. From the Group’s perspective, the funds function in practice as a subsidiary. Against this backdrop, Intrum has resolved to consolidate the investment funds as a subsidiary in the consolidated financial statements. Joint venture As stated in Note 13, in 2018, the Intrum Group invested in profit participating notes issued by the Irish company Ithaca Investment DAC. Through its holding in the profit participating notes and the wording of the agreement, Intrum holds a position closely corresponding to that of a shareholder in the company, and the consolidated accounts therefore treat the profit participating notes as though they were an equity instrument issued by Ithaca Investment DAC. Although Intrum’s holding corresponds to 80 percent of the profit participating notes issued shareholder loans, through an agreement with another investor holding 20 percent of the profit participating notes, the two parties share a controlling influence, and Intrum therefore reports the investment according to the rules for joint ventures. Provisions for restructuring As shown in Notes 3, 22 and 24, Intrum made provisions for future expenses in 2019, mainly for restructuring. These provisions have been made in accordance with the rules in IAS 37 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets. Among other things, these rules entail provisions only being made when Intrum has an existing liability or obligation as a result of events that have occurred. For restructuring, this only applies when a formal detailed plan has been drawn up and communicated to those concerned in sufficient detail that they have known or can be expected to have anticipated, by the balance sheet date, the termination of their employment. Also under other circumstances, provisions are made and costs expensed only when Intrum has an existing liability in the form of a legal or informal obligation to pay, by the balance sheet date, for goods or services received. Acquisitions In 2019, Intrum entered into agreements on acquisitions, in particular the acquisition of Solvia in Spain and the companies acquired through the partnership with Piraeus Bank in Greece. The acquisitions and acquisition analyses are detailed in Note 35. The acquisitions were large and complex, and the acquisition analyses may be adjusted in upcoming quarters. ###### Note 36 Related parties In addition to associated companies and joint ventures, related parties include the Board of Directors and senior executives, according to Note 28, as well as close family members to these executives and other companies over which they can exert a significant influence. All transactions with related parties are conducted on market terms and at arm’s length. In 2019, Intrum purchased services from LBHF Joint Ventures Ltd for SEK 6.2 M, from Sothernwood Consulting for SEK 0.6 M and from CSA services for SEK 0.4 M. Three individuals, including the country manager for the UK, Edward Nott, are members of the Board of LBHF Joint Venture. In 2019, Intrum purchased services from Telecredit IFN SA for SEK 1.0 M. Catalin Feneleom Neagu is a shareholder in the company. In 2019, his involvement in Telecredit IFN was discontinued. In 2019, Intrum purchased services from Telecredit IFN SA for SEK 1.0 M. Catalin Feneleom Neagu is a shareholder in the company. In 2019, his involvement in Telecredit IFN was discontinued. ”Although the Parent Company has close relationship to its subsidiaries, see Note 12, it has no transactions with other related parties. Over the year, the Parent Company received SEK 380 M (214) in income from sales of services to Group subsidiaries, and incurred SEK 107 M (75) in expenses attributable to services purchased from subsidiaries.” ###### Note 37 Reconciliation of key figures SEK M 2019 2018 Items affecting comparability in revenues Positive revaluations of portfolio investments 920 795 Negative revaluations of portfolio investments -892 -707 Impact from early termination of BPO contract 177 223 Total items affecting comparability in revenues 205 311 Items affecting comparability in operating income Positive revaluations of portfolio investments 920 795 Negative revaluations of portfolio investments -892 -707 Integration costs Lindorff -224 -352 Transaction costs for M&A -274 -224 Impact from early termination of BPO contract 147 178 Impairment write-down of goodwill -2,700 0 Efficiency Program -656 0 Other reccurring items -469 -212 Total items affecting comparability in operating -4,148 -522 income Items affecting comparability by income statement line Revenues from clients 177 223 Positive revaluations of portfolio investments 920 795 Negative revaluations of portfolio investments -892 -707 Cost of sales -819 -60 Sales, marketing and administration costs -834 -773 Impairment write-down of goodwill -2,700 0 Total items affecting comparability in operating income -4,148 -522 ----- SEK M 2019 2018 Adjusted revenue Revenues 15,985 13,442 Items affecting comparability -205 -311 Adjusted revenue 15,780 13,131 EBIT Adjusted Operating income (EBIT) 2,060 3,978 Items affecting comparability 4,148 522 Total EBIT Adjusted 6,208 4,500 Portfolio income excluding revaluations Portfolio income 4,877 3,464 Revaluations -28 -88 Portfolio income excluding revaluations 4,849 3,376 Average carrying value Average carrying value receivables 26,669 22,990 Average carrying value joint ventures 5,643 2,373 Average carrying value real estate 1,534 145 Total average carrying value 33,845 25,508 Return including revaluations 15 14 Return excluding revaluations 15 13 Cash EBITDA EBIT 2,060 3,978 Deprecation 1,246 900 Amortization on portfolios 4,183 3,942 Cash EBITDA 7,489 8,820 Net Debt Liabilities to credit institutions 6,186 6,830 Bond loans 41,644 34,254 Provisions for pensions 387 263 Commercial paper 2,794 2,123 Cash and cash equivalents -1,906 -1,348 Net Debt at end of period 49,105 42,122 Return on portfolio investments Return on portfolio investments is the service line earnings for the period, excluding operations in factoring and payment guarantees, recalculated on a full-year basis, as a percentage of the average carrying amount of the balance-sheet item purchased debt. The ratio sets the service line’s earnings in relation to the amount of capital tied up and is included in the Group’s financial targets. During the year, the definition of average book value for the full year was adjusted to be based on the average of the quarters instead of the opening and closing book value for the full year. EBITDA Operating earnings before depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) are operating earnings after reversal of depreciation of fixed assets except portfolio investments. Cash EBITDA Cash EBITDA is operating earnings after depreciation on fixed assets as well as amortisation and revaluations of portfolio investments are added back. Items affecting comparability Significant earnings items that are not included in the Group’s normal recurring operations and that are not expected to return on a regular basis. These include revaluations of portfolio investments, restructuring costs, closure costs, reversal of restructuring or closure reservations, cost savings programs, integration costs, ex¬traordinary projects, divestments, impairment of non-current fixed assets other than portfolio investments, acquisition and divestment expens¬es, advisory costs for discontinued acquisition projects, costs for relocation to new office space, termination nd recruitment costs for members of Group Management and country managers, as well as external expenses for disputes and unu¬sual agreements. Items affecting comparability are specified because they are difficult to predict and have low forecast values for the Group’s future earnings trend. Adjusted operating earnings (EBIT) Adjusted operating earnings (EBIT) are operating earnings excluding revaluations of portfolio investments and items affecting comparability. ###### Note 38 Discontinued operations In connection with the merger between Intrum Justitia and Lindorff that was implemented on the 27th of June 2017, Intrum undertook to the European Commission to divest Intrum Justitia’s Norwegian subsidiaries, as well as Lindorff’s Swedish, Finnish, Danish and Estonian subsidiaries. In November 2017, Intrum agreed to divest these subsidiaries to a company in the Lowell Group, and the transaction was finalised in March 2018, in connection with which Intrum received the purchase consideration of SEK 7,511 M. In the income statement, the subsidiaries being divested in accordance with the above have been reported in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-cur­rent Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations as discontinued operations, with the comparative figures for previous years being recalculated. Earnings from discontinued operations are stated below: Group SEK M 2019 2018 Net revenues - 415 Operating expenses - –335 Operating earnings (EBIT) - 80 Net financial items - –7 Profit before tax - 73 Taxes - –5 Earnings from discontinued operations - 68 Loss on disposal including accumulated translation - -141 differences Total earnings from discontinued operations - -73 The loss on disposal includes transaction costs of SEK 126 M. The above income statements include Intrum Justitia’s Norwegian subsidiaries up until the 31st of March 2018, as well as Lindorff’s Swedish, Finnish, Danish and Estonian subsidiaries up until the 31st of March 2018. ###### Not 39 Events after the reporting year Buyback program On 13 March 2020 the Board of Directors of Intrum AB (publ) resolved to initiate a share buyback program with the purpose to reduce Intrum’s share capital through cancellation of the shares that are repurchased. Through the program, Intrum will return further funds to shareholders and it is the Board of Directors’ assessment that this will give the company a more optimal capital structure. The maximum number of shares that can be repurchased is 12,554,132. Impact of Covid-19 on Intrum’s business On 25 March 2020 Intrum informed that the effects of Covid-19 vary from market to market. To date, countries in southern Europe have been hardest hit by the ongoing virus outbreak, which has affected all aspects of society. Intrum’s Strategic Markets business line is experiencing delays in cash flows due to general restrictions brought in across countries and reduced activity in legal systems in particular. The secured assets relating to the cash flows however remain. In other European markets however, the effect on Intrum’s activities has been relatively limited. Global events related to the spread of Covid-19 are expected to have negative impacts on the company’s productivity and results for a period of time. Our preliminary assessment is that reported earnings will be affected to a greater extent than cash EBITDA, but it is currently too early to quantify the financial effects. Intrum has decided to reduce the rate of investment and increase the yield requirements on new portfolio investments while also to a very limited extent review M&A projects. Reduced M&A activity and lower investment in portfolio activities frees up a greater degree of cash flow in the business. As a result of the impact of Covid-19 on Intrum’s business, updated financial targets will be communicated at the capital markets day, which is planned to be held in the coming autumn. ----- #### Proposed appropriation of earnings The Parent Company’s distributable funds are at the disposal of the Board of Directors as follows: SEK Share premium reserve 17,441,835,284 Retained earnings -2,612,982,535 Net earnings for the year -687,077,416 Total 14,141,775,334 The Board of Directors’ complete statement motivating the proposed disposition of earnings for the 2019 fiscal year will be presented in a separate document prior to the 2020 Annual General Meeting. It concludes, among other things, that the proposed dividend is in line with the Company’s dividend policy and that the Board, having considered the nature, scope and risks of the Company’s operations, as well as the Company’s and the Group’s consolidation requirements, liquidity and financial position in general, has found no indications that the proposed dividend is unjustified. The Board of Directors and the President certify that the Annual Report has been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards in Sweden and that the consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with the international accounting standards referred to in Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002 on the application of international accounting standards. The Board of Director propose that the earnings be distributed as follows[1]: SEK Dividend, 131,541,320 shares x SEK 11.00 1,440,354,520 Balance carried forward 12,701,420,814 Total 14,141,775,334 1) The total amount of the dividend payment and the amount carried forward as distributable retained earnings after the dividend pay-out, will be adjusted based on the amount of treasury shares held by Intrum at the record date for the dividend payment. The annual accounts and consolidated accounts give a true and fair view of the financial position and results of the Parent Company and the Group. The Board of Directors’ Report for the Parent Company and the Group gives a true and fair overview of the operations, financial position and results of the Parent Company and the Group, and describes significant risks and uncertainties that the Parent Company and the companies in the Group face. The annual and consolidated accounts were approved for publication by the Board of Directors and the President on 1 April 2020 and are proposed for approval by the Annual General Meeting on 6 May 2020.

Ernst & Young AB Jesper Nilsson Authorised Public Accountant ----- # Audit report To the general meeting of the shareholders of Intrum AB (publ), corporate identity number 556607-7581 ###### Report on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts Opinions We have audited the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of Intrum AB (publ) for the year 2019. The annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the company are included on pages 53-99 in this document. In our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the parent company as of 31 December 2019 and its financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act. The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the group as of 31 December 2019 and their financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU, and the Annual Accounts Act. The statutory administration report is consistent with the other parts of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. We therefore recommend that the general meeting of shareholders adopts the income statement and balance sheet for the parent company and the group. Our opinions in this report on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts are consistent with the content of the additional report that has been submitted to the parent company’s audit committee in accordance with the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 11. Basis for Opinions We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities section. We are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. This includes that, based on the best of our knowledge and belief, no prohibited services referred to in the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 5.1 have been provided to the audited company or, where applicable, its parent company or its controlled companies within the EU. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters of the audit are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of, and in forming our opinion thereon, the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context. We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying financial statements. Income recognition _Description_ Consolidated net revenues for 2019 amounted to SEK 15,985 M. As is evident from Notes 2 and 3 to the annual accounts, net revenues are distributed between the various revenue sources, including collection fees, commissions and fees, as well as amounts collected on portfolio investments less amortisation. The number of transactions in the various flows is extensive, which places high demands on the Company’s internal controls and administrative processes. We have therefore assessed the income statement and the related IT systems as a particularly important area in the audit. _How our audit addressed this key audit matter_ In our audit, we examined principles for revenue recognition, processes for significant revenue streams and related IT systems. We have, among other things, tested the Company’s controls, performed an analytical review and evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s controls for IT systems of relevance for income recognition. On a random basis, we have also examined income against agreements and amounts paid in. Processes for programme development, programme changes and access management have been reviewed, as has the monitoring and handling of incidents. We have also reviewed the disclosures in the financial statements regarding income recognition. Goodwill _Description_ Goodwill is reported in the amount of SEK 33,358 M in the consolidated balance sheet as per 31 December 2019. Over the fiscal year, goodwill increased by SEK 303 M as a consequence of acquisitions during the year and currency effect, however reduced by recognised impairment losses. The Company tests, at least annually and when there is an indication of impairment, that the carrying values do not exceed the assets’ recoverable amounts. The recoverable amounts are determined by calculating the value in use of each cash generating unit, in connection with which estimated future cash flows are discounted. The Company’s cash flow forecasts are based on historical experience, business plans and other forward-looking assessments. The impairment test for 2019 resulted in an impairment of SEK 2,700 M in the Iberian Peninsula and Latin America region. A description of the accounting principles for goodwill is presented in Note 1 and the impairment testing, as well as critical estimates and assumptions are presented in Notes 10 and 35. As a consequence of the reported amounts being of material importance to the financial reporting and the assessments and critical assumptions required for the calculation of the value in use, we have assessed goodwill accounting as an area of particular importance in the audit. _How our audit addressed this key audit matter_ We have assessed the Company’s process for performing impairment testing. We have examined valuation methods and calculations, the reasonableness of the assumptions made and sensitivity analyses for changed assumptions supported by our valuation specialists. Comparisons have been made with historical results, and other companies in the same sector. The precision of previous forecasts has been evaluated. We have also reviewed the disclosures in the financial statements regarding goodwill. Portfolio investments _Description_ Portfolio investments is reported at SEK 28 508 M in the consolidated balance sheet as per 31 December 2019. Reporting follows the effective interest method, where the carrying value of each portfolio corresponds to the present value of expected future cash flows. The expected cash flows are discounted at an effective interest rate determined on the acquisition of the respective portfolios. Current cash flow projections and book values ----- are monitored over the course of the year based on, among other things, achieved collection results, agreements reached with customers on instalment plans and macroeconomic information. Accounting principles for portfolio investments are presented in Note 1, critical estimates and assumptions are presented in Note 35, and a description of portfolio investments is given in Note 14. The Company’s accounting of portfolio investments is considered to be a particularly important area in the audit due to reported amounts being of significance for the financial reporting and the portfolio valuations require the Company to make estimates, assumptions and judgements. _How our audit addressed this key audit matter_ In our audit, we have, among other things, evaluated the Company’s processes for valuing portfolio investments, related IT systems, the valuation models applied, and the reasonableness of the assumptions made in calculating effective interest rates. We have also reviewed the company’s ongoing review of book values. We have also reviewed the disclosures in the financial statements regarding portfolio investments. Other Information than the annual accounts and consolidated accounts This document also contains other information than the annual accounts and consolidated accounts and is found on pages 1-52 and 103-114. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for this other information. Our opinion on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts does not cover this other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion regarding this other information. In connection with our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, our responsibility is to read the information identified above and consider whether the information is materially inconsistent with the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. In this procedure we also take into account our knowledge otherwise obtained in the audit and assess whether the information otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we, based on the work performed concerning this information, conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the preparation of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts and that they give a fair presentation in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and, concerning the consolidated accounts, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of annual accounts and consolidated accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the assessment of the company’s and the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They disclose, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis of accounting is however not applied if the Board of Directors and the Managing Director intends to liquidate the company, to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Audit Committee shall, without prejudice to the Board of Director’s responsibilities and tasks in general, among other things oversee the company’s financial reporting process. Auditor’s responsibility Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these annual accounts and consolidated accounts. As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. - Obtain an understanding of the company’s internal control relevant to our audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control. - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors and the Managing Director. - Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ and the Managing Director’s use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. We also draw a conclusion, based on the audit evidence obtained, as to whether any material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s and the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the annual accounts and consolidated accounts or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion about the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause a company and a group to cease to continue as a going concern. - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, including the disclosures, and whether the annual accounts and consolidated accounts represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. - Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated accounts. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our opinions. We must inform the Board of Directors of, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit. We must also inform of significant audit findings during our audit, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identified. We must also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, including the most important assessed risks for material misstatement, and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in the auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes disclosure about the matter. ----- ###### Report on other legal and regulatory requirements Opinions In addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, we have also audited the administration of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director of Intrum AB (publ) for the year 2019 and the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss. We recommend to the general meeting of shareholders that the profit be appropriated (loss be dealt with) in accordance with the proposal in the statutory administration report and that the members of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director be discharged from liability for the financial year. Basis for opinions We conducted the audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities section. We are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director The Board of Directors is responsible for the proposal for appropriations of the company’s profit or loss. At the proposal of a dividend, this includes an assessment of whether the dividend is justifiable considering the requirements which the company’s and the group’s type of operations, size and risks place on the size of the parent company’s and the group’s equity, consolidation requirements, liquidity and position in general. The Board of Directors is responsible for the company’s organization and the administration of the company’s affairs. This includes among other things continuous assessment of the company’s and the group’s financial situation and ensuring that the company’s organization is designed so that the accounting, management of assets and the company’s financial affairs otherwise are controlled in a reassuring manner. The Managing Director shall manage the ongoing administration according to the Board of Directors’ guidelines and instructions and among other matters take measures that are necessary to fulfill the company’s accounting in accordance with law and handle the management of assets in a reassuring manner. Auditor’s responsibility Our objective concerning the audit of the administration, and thereby our opinion about discharge from liability, is to obtain audit evidence to assess with a reasonable degree of assurance whether any member of the Board of Directors or the Managing Director in any material respect: - has undertaken any action or been guilty of any omission which can give rise to liability to the company, or - in any other way has acted in contravention of the Companies Act, the Annual Accounts Act or the Articles of Association. Our objective concerning the audit of the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss, and thereby our opinion about this, is to assess with reasonable degree of assurance whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect actions or omissions that can give rise to liability to the company, or that the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss are not in accordance with the Companies Act. As part of an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. The examination of the administration and the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss is based primarily on the audit of the accounts. Additional audit procedures performed are based on our professional judgment with starting point in risk and materiality. This means that we focus the examination on such actions, areas and relationships that are material for the operations and where deviations and violations would have particular importance for the company’s situation. We examine and test decisions undertaken, support for decisions, actions taken and other circumstances that are relevant to our opinion concerning discharge from liability. As a basis for our opinion on the Board of Directors’ proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss we examined the Board of Directors’ reasoned statement and a selection of supporting evidence in order to be able to assess whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act.
