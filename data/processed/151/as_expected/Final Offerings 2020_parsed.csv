The expression “Prospectus Regulation” means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended), and includes any relevant implementing measure in each member state (“EEA Member State”) of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) or the United Kingdom. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer within the EEA or the United Kingdom of the Notes should only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for us or the Initial Purchasers to produce a prospectus for such offer. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do authorize, the making of any offer of Notes through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial Purchasers, which constitute the final placement of the Notes contemplated in this Offering Memorandum. The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA or the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a “qualified investor” as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 iii ----- (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or the United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or the United Kingdom may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. For the purposes of this section, the expression an “offer of Notes to the public” in relation to any Notes in any EEA Member State or the United Kingdom means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe the Notes, as the same may be varied in that EEA Member State or the United Kingdom by any measure implementing the Prospectus Regulation in that EEA Member State or the United Kingdom. Professional investors and ECPs (as defined below) only target market: Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of each of Morgan Stanley & Co International Plc, J.P. Morgan Securities plc, DNB Bank ASA, Nordea Bank Abp, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (publ) and Swedbank AB (publ) as Joint Bookrunners of the Notes (each a “Manufacturer”), the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties (“ECPs”) and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to ECPs and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the Manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, and without prejudice to our obligations in accordance with MiFID II, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the Manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (including comparative information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017), the Issuer’s operating segments were comprised of four geographical regions in which its clients were located: (i) Northern Europe (including Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Norway and Sweden), (ii) Central and Eastern Europe (including Greece, Poland, Romania, Switzerland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary and Austria), (iii) Western and Southern Europe (including Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom) and (iv) Iberian Peninsula and Latin America (including Spain, Portugal and Brazil). Central and common expenses were spread across the geographical regions in proportion to their purchasing power parity-adjusted revenues. In addition, the Issuer also reported certain results by service offering, which were divided into two service lines: (i) the Credit Management Services service line, which focused on late payments and collection, collection services, credit information services and payment services and real estate services (“RES”) for Intrum-owned or third-party portfolios; and (ii) the Portfolio Investments service line, which focused on the acquisition of portfolios of overdue receivables at less than their nominal value, after which Intrum collected the receivables on its own behalf, and our “real",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

In the Financial Statements, references to Cash EBITDA are to Adjusted Cash EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA, as applicable. _Factors impacting comparability IFRS 5_ In November 2017, in connection with the Divestment, the Issuer agreed to divest certain subsidiaries to a company in the Lowell Group. The Divestment completed on March 20, 2018. In the income statement for the year ended December 31, 2018 (including comparative information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017), the subsidiaries being divested in accordance with the above have been reported as discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. In the balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 included as comparative information in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2018, subsidiaries being divested are reported as assets and liabilities held for sale. For further information, see note 39 in the Issuer’s audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. _IFRS 9_ With effect from January 1, 2018, in accordance with the rules for loans and receivables under IFRS 9, which replaced IAS 39 (or, for any annual periods prior to January 1, 2018, according to IAS 39), portfolio investments are recognized at amortized cost according to the effective interest rate model. The new rules for portfolio investments require that we continue to report these according to an EIR model, with minor adjustments in application. The primary change is that, in accordance with IFRS 9, acquired credit-impaired receivables can be reported at a higher recognized value than cost if our estimates of future cash flows change, which differs from our application of the corresponding rules under IAS 39. _IFRS 15 and IFRS 16_ We adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers from January 1, 2018 and IFRS 16 Leases from January 1, 2019.

These measures are not measures of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS, and they may not accurately reflect our performance, liquidity or our ability to incur or service debt. EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted Cash EBITDA, Pro _Forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA and EBITDA Margin are used by management as indicators of our operating_ performance. - “EBIT” means profit and loss for the period before taxes and net financial items. - “EBITDA” means EBIT before amortization and depreciation of non-financial assets. - “Cash EBITDA” means EBITDA before amortization and revaluation of portfolio investments. - “Adjusted Cash EBITDA” means Cash EBITDA adjusted for (a) earnings from joint ventures and cash flow from joint ventures in order to replace the EBITDA contribution from joint ventures with the actual cash contribution from joint ventures, (b) goodwill impairment, and (c) certain items affecting comparability. See “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data—Other _Financial Information and Operating Data.”_ - “Pro Forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA” means Adjusted Cash EBITDA adjusted for the pro forma effect of significant acquisitions made during the period under review. xii ----- - “EBITDA Margin” represents EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. For a reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted Cash EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA to profit and loss for the period and/or cash flow from operating activities as presented in the Financial Statements see “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data.” Non-recurring items include certain costs and other items that management views as not expected to return on a regular basis however there can be no assurance that certain of these items will not recur in any given subsequent period. The non-IFRS financial measures presented herein are not recognized measures of financial performance under IFRS, but measures used by management to monitor the underlying performance of our business and operations. In particular, the non-IFRS financial measures should not be viewed as substitutes for revenue, other income, operating earnings, profit/(loss) for the period, cash flows from operating activities at period end or other income statement or cash flow items computed in accordance with IFRS. The non-IFRS financial measures do not necessarily indicate whether cash flow will be sufficient or available to meet our cash requirements and may not be indicative of our historical operating results, nor are such measures meant to be predictive of our future results. EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted Cash EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA and EBITDA Margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for, an analysis of our results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are: - they do not reflect cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; - they do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on debt; and - although depreciation, amortization and impairment are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will generally need to be replaced in the future and EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted Cash EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA and EBITDA Margin do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements. We have presented these non-IFRS measures in this Offering Memorandum because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of our performance and believe that they are widely used by investors comparing performance between companies. As not all companies compute these or other non-IFRS financial measures in the same way, the manner in which our management has chosen to compute the non-IFRS financial measures presented herein may not be comparable with similarly defined terms used by other companies. This Offering Memorandum contains certain synergy and operational efficiency improvement results, among others, relating to cost reductions and other benefits (including those that have been realized in connection with the Merger) as well as costs related to implementing such measures. Such estimates are based on a number of assumptions made in reliance on the information available to us and management’s judgments based on such information. The assumptions used in estimating the synergies, operational efficiency improvements and related costs are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the synergy benefit and operational efficiency improvement estimates. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to our industry and _business—Acquisitions or carve-out transactions may prove unsuccessful or strain or divert our resources and we may not be able to manage our growth effectively” and “Risk Factors—Risks related to our industry and business—Anticipated synergies from the Merger or operational efficiency improvements from continued efficiency improvements programs may not materialize.”_ The non-IFRS measures presented in this Offering Memorandum should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with IFRS and have not been prepared in accordance with SEC requirements, IFRS or the generally accepted accounting principles in use in any other jurisdiction.

151,Final Offerings 2020.md,7,FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,7.7,Key operating metrics,7.7.1,,"In this Offering Memorandum, we present various key operating metrics. We believe that these metrics are helpful in understanding our performance from period to period and facilitate comparison with our peers. These metrics are not measures of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS. The key operating metrics included in this Offering Memorandum are defined as follows: - **Average collection of forecasts:** average collection of forecasts is the gross collections on portfolio investments divided by the latest active forecast, on a rolling twelve-month basis. - **Collection cost ratio:** collection cost ratio, in relation to debt purchasing, is the cost to collect relative to gross collections. - **Effective Interest Rate (“EIR”):** under IFRS, EIR is the effective interest rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial xiv ----- liability. This means that the EIR is set based on the ERC (as defined below) at the date of purchase and the portfolio’s purchase price. - **Estimated Remaining Collections** (“ERC”): ERC is the nominal value of estimated remaining collections on portfolio investments plus estimated remaining collections from contributions from each of the portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables purchased through co-investor agreements in proportion to our relative ownership interest in each such portfolio. ERC is calculated as of a point in time, assuming no additional purchases are made thereafter. These expectations are based on historical and current portfolio collection performance data and trends and assumptions about future debt collection rates. There can be no assurances that such collections will be achieved within the specified time periods, or at all. ERC is a measure that is also often used by other companies in the credit management industry. However, it may be calculated differently by other companies. ERC is presented because it represents an estimate of the anticipated future cash collections on our portfolio investments at any point in time, which is an important supplemental measure used by our management to assess our performance and underscores the cash generation capacity of the assets backing our business. We use ERC as the business case forecast horizon when purchasing portfolios. We also use it for accounting purposes and because it is used under the instruments or agreements governing our indebtedness to monitor our performance when the lenders are providing funding of portfolio purchases. In this Offering Memorandum we present ERC over an 180 month period. However, for the purpose of the covenants under the Indenture, the Existing Notes Indentures, the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, ERC will be measured over an 84 month period. See “Description of the Notes” and “Description of Other Indebtedness.” - **Gross cash-on-cash multiple:** gross cash-on-cash multiple is the actual gross collections to date, plus the ERC as of the same date, divided by the total amount paid for the portfolio at the date of purchase. - **Gross collections on portfolio investments:** gross collections on portfolio investments are the total principal, interest, collection fees and legal fees received on portfolios that we own or, in the case of debt purchased through co-investment agreements, a share of the aggregate gross collections on portfolio investments equal to our relative ownership interest in such portfolio investments. - **Portfolio investments:** portfolio investments consist of portfolios of delinquent consumer debts, loans, overdue trade receivables (“OTR”) and other receivables purchased at prices below the nominal receivable. As used in this Offering Memorandum, “portfolio investments” and “loans and other overdue receivables” may be used interchangeably, as the context requires. - **Portfolio investments book value:** portfolio investments book value is the amount recognized in the balance sheet from portfolio investments. The book value of each portfolio corresponds to the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted by the applicable EIR. Portfolio investments book value represents the aggregate book value of portfolios of purchased loans and receivables as of the dates presented. With respect to co-investment portfolios that we do not exercise control over, only the proportionate share of the portfolio corresponding to our investment is recorded on the balance sheet. - **Return on portfolio investments:** return on portfolio investments is the earnings on the portfolio investments component of the business for the period, excluding factoring and payment guarantees, recalculated on a full-year basis, as a percentage of the average carrying amount of the balance-sheet item Portfolio Investments.

The words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “estimate,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “aim” or “might” and similar expressions or the negatives of these expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Other forward-looking statements can be identified in the context in which the statements are made. Forward-looking statements occur in a number of places in this Offering Memorandum, including, among others, in the sections entitled “Summary,” “Risk Factors,” “Management Discussion and _Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Industry Overview” and “Business” and include,_ among other things, statements relating to: - our strategy, outlook and growth prospects; - our operational and financial targets and dividend policy; - our liquidity, capital resources and capital expenditure; - our planned investments, acquisitions and/or divestments; - the expectations as to future growth in demand for our products and services; - the expected growth and other anticipated benefits, including any revenue or cost synergies or other operational efficiency programs; - our increased focus on certain business areas and movement into new business areas, such as secured loans and receivables and real estate servicing; - the impact of regulations on us and our operations; - the impact of changes in tax regulations that we are subject to; - the competitive environment in which we operate; and - the outcome of legal proceedings.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Important risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause these differences include, but are not limited to: - changes in the economic conditions or trends in the markets in which we operate, including as a result of pandemics such as the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic or other global economic and social disruptions; - inability to compete with businesses that may offer more attractive prices or have greater financing resources; - reliance on clients in the financial services industry and risk of material failures in banking systems; - inability to collect payments on receivables owned or managed by us, including through litigation or insolvency proceedings, and our customers’ inability to fulfil their payment obligations towards us, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; - errors in our collection process or other operational matters, such as failure of third parties as part of the supply chain to provide certain services; vii ----- - inability to purchase portfolios at sufficient levels, appropriate prices or of sufficient quality due to a lack of supply or lack of funding, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and unwillingness of clients to outsource their credit management services to us; - failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and codes of practice or changes to the regulatory environment in which we operate; - failure of our statistical models and data analysis tools to accurately assess pricing terms and project remaining cash flows from our portfolios; - deterioration in the value of our existing portfolios and inability to address underlying concerns; - inability to replace terminated or expired forward flow agreements or renew existing or future debt collection contracts; - negative attention relating to the credit management industry in general, or to us in particular; - inability to manage our international operations and expansion plans, achieve our strategic goals or identify and anticipate future risks; - failure to integrate acquired businesses, dispose of businesses and realize planned synergy or operational efficiency improvements benefits, within anticipated timeframes or at all, from past or future acquisitions (including, without limitation, our continued operational efficiency improvements program); - inability to manage financial, legal, operational and/or compliance risks associated with our current or future joint ventures, business alliances or consortia; - reliance on our senior management team and trained employees; - inability to maintain, manage, integrate and develop our IT or data analysis systems or anticipate, manage or adopt technological advances within our industry; - failure to maintain IT security or protect our data analysis system; - failure to adequately protect our clients’ sensitive data; - negative impact of litigations, investigations and other proceedings; - the effect of recent or future tax changes in jurisdictions in which we operate or are otherwise tax resident, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; - inability to recoup our costs of investment upon the sale of our portfolio investments; - inability to access capital and credit markets to raise additional capital to fund our operations and service our debt, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; - our substantial leverage and debt service obligations and ability to effectively operate our business within the restrictions imposed by the terms of our existing or future indebtedness; and - additional factors that could cause our actual results or performance to differ materially, include, but are not limited to, those discussed under “Risk Factors.” These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Offering Memorandum.

Such estimates are based on a number of assumptions viii ----- made in reliance on the information available to us and management’s judgments based on such information. The assumptions used in estimating synergies, operational efficiency improvements and related costs are inherently uncertain and are subject to a variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any synergy benefit or operational efficiency improvements estimates.

Unless otherwise indicated, such information is based on our analysis of multiple sources. Such information has been accurately reproduced and, as far as we are aware from such information, no facts have been omitted which would render the information provided inaccurate or misleading. However, certain information may be based upon data, forecasts, and information obtained prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and does not take into account, nor make any revisions, to assess the impact that this event may have on the current or future trends and any assumptions about the future outlook in this environment are made at the reader’s own risk. Industry publications or reports generally state that the information they contain has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed. We have not independently verified and cannot give any assurance as to the accuracy of market data contained in this Offering Memorandum that were extracted or derived from these industry publications or reports. Market data and statistics are inherently predictive and subject to uncertainty and not necessarily reflective of actual market conditions. Such statistics are based on market research, which itself is based on sampling and subjective judgments by both the researchers and the respondents, including judgments about what types of products and transactions should be included in the relevant market. This Offering Memorandum also contains estimates of market data and information derived therefrom that cannot be gathered from publications by market research institutions or any other independent sources. Such information is prepared by us based on third-party sources and our own internal estimates, including studies of the market that we have commissioned. In many cases there is no publicly available information on such market data, for example from industry associations, public authorities or other organizations and institutions. We believe that our estimates of market data and information derived therefrom are helpful in order to give investors a better understanding of the industry in which we operate as well as our position within the industry. Although we believe that our internal market observations are reliable, our own estimates are not reviewed or verified by any external sources. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding the industry or similar data presented herein, such data involves risks and uncertainties and is subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed under the headings “Presentation of Financial and Other Information” and “Risk Factors” in this Offering Memorandum. Statements regarding the Company’s position as the leading credit management company in Europe and the largest pan-European credit management company are based on reported information among European peer companies for a number of metrics (such as revenue, EBITDA and portfolio investments book value). However, in certain instances such metrics may be calculated differently by our competitors and therefore may not be directly comparable. Statements regarding European bank non-performing loan (“NPL”) stock are based on European Banking Authority (“EBA”) data. This figure (i) does not include NPLs held by non-bank entities and therefore does not include large volumes of NPLs sold over the years to credit funds or debt purchasers such as ourselves and (ii) includes NPLs relating to the large corporate segment, which we compete in on an opportunistic basis, as well as corporate debt (“B2B”) to SMEs, both of which are not part of our Core Addressable Market. Our Core Addressable Market comprises all consumer debt originated by financial institutions whereas our Addressable Market comprises all debt originated by financial institutions. As a result, the stock of the NPLs in our Core Addressable Market is significantly smaller than our Addressable Market. See “Industry Overview— _Overview of the European credit management services and debt purchasing industry—Market segments.”_ Certain reports and publications from which we have obtained industry and market data that are used in this Offering Memorandum, including reports prepared by the EBA and Deloitte, were published before the COVID-19 pandemic and therefore do not reflect any impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on any specific market or globally. xvii -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

As described below, our three segments allow us to offer a full range of services covering a client’s entire CMS value chain, with each segment also working complementarily to drive business and improve data and expertise in other segments. Prior to January 1, 2020, we operated our business with two service lines, our Credit Management Services service line and our Portfolio Investments service line, and with a focus on four geographic regions. Our financial information for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 is presented on the basis of two service lines and four geographic regions. Our financial information for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 (and in this Offering Memorandum, certain financial information for the year ended December 31, 2019 and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020), and going forward our financial information will be, presented in line with our current three segment organization. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, our revenue was SEK 15,668 million (€1,470 million equivalent) and Pro Forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA was SEK 11,246 million (€1,055 million equivalent). See “Summary _Historical Consolidated _Financial and Other Data.”_ - **_Credit Management Services segment. Through our Credit Management Services segment, we employ tailored debt collection strategies and solutions to maximize cash flow streams from loans and other overdue receivables for clients who have decided to outsource their debt collection function, other than in the countries included in our Strategic Markets segment. In addition to, and generally in combination with, collection services, we provide capabilities in alternative solutions and offer clients a wide range of value-added services prior to loans and receivables becoming overdue. Our value-added service offering includes credit information and analysis on individuals and companies to help our clients assess their potential customers’ payment capacity, data extraction and modelling, selection and scoring of potential customers, our RES offering and a full suite of services relating to accounts receivable, including invoicing, reminders and account ledger services. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, our Credit Management Services segment generated revenue of SEK 4,559 million (€428 million equivalent), excluding revenue generated from portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables that we own. 1 ----- - **_Strategic Markets segment. As of January 1, 2020, we simplified our organizational structure, transitioning away from two service lines that focused on four geographic regions and establishing Strategic Markets as our third segment alongside our Credit Management Services segment and Portfolio Investments segment. The establishment of the Strategic Markets segment reflects our strategic growth in recent years. Our Strategic Markets segment focuses on providing CMS in our Brazilian, Greek, Italian and Spanish operations, with the Greek, Italian and Spanish markets in particular being large and important markets in which we have similar operations based on partnerships with major financial institutions, including our Piraeus Partnership in Greece and our Intesa Partnership in Italy. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, our Strategic Markets segment generated revenue of SEK 4,819 million (€452 million equivalent), excluding revenue generated from portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables that we own. - **_Portfolio Investments segment. Through our Portfolio Investments segment, we offer a range of portfolio investment financial services, including our REO offering. Our portfolio investment financial services focuses on the purchase portfolios of secured and unsecured loans and other overdue receivables from our clients for a portion of their nominal value, which we generally then service using our in-house debt collection function. Upon purchase of defaulted receivables, we put in place long-term debt collection measures aimed at helping customers become debt-free as we work together to reduce their debt. In line with our core values, which are based on an empathetic and ethical approach to helping indebted customers become debt free in a respectful manner, we interact with every customer to craft solutions on the basis of their individual circumstances, for example through instalment plans that take account of each consumer’s payment capacity. As part of our Portfolio Investments segment, we also provide factoring, payment guarantees and e-commerce services. Our Portfolio Investments segment also houses our REO offering (including our REO offering in Brazil, Greece, Italy and Spain), which includes, either in the course of recovery activities for secured loans (or, infrequently, in relation to unsecured loans with personal guarantees) or as a standalone investment strategy, directly or indirectly and independently or alongside co-investors, holding title to real estate that we expect to eventually resell. We arrange for the sale of such real estate using internal and external resources and networks. Our real estate exposure within our Portfolio Investment segment is concentrated in Italy, Hungary, Portugal and Spain. Properties are either wholly owned or held by joint ventures in which we participate along with our co-investors. Our properties, including both wholly owned properties and properties held by joint ventures in which we participate along with our co-investors, total to approximately 5,816 properties. The book value of real estate assets in our consolidated balance sheet together with our joint ventures' book value related to properties as of June 30, 2020 was SEK 765 million. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, we generated revenue of SEK 6,297 million (€591 million equivalent) from our Portfolio Investments segment. As of June 30, 2020, the ERC of our portfolios of loans and overdue receivables was SEK 64,674 million (€6,162 million equivalent). We believe that the combination of our debt collection services, portfolio investments expertise and strategic financial institution partnerships has been and will continue to be key to our success. Our complete range of services helps attract and retain clients and increases the breadth and depth of collectible data, in turn supporting the creation of tailored collection strategies and development of analytical capabilities to more accurately price portfolios. Operating across Europe with an integrated and balanced business model also gives us investment optionality as we can allocate resources across our platform and jurisdictions to pursue the opportunities that we find most attractive. Our breadth of service and geographic diversification also increases our resilience to economic disruptions (such as that caused by the COVID-19 pandemic). The diversified nature of our business allows us to effectively mitigate some of the resulting negative impact.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521
151,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Our Strengths,9.4.1,Europe’s leading credit management company,"_The largest credit management company in Europe_ We are the largest full-service European credit management company by revenue, Cash EBITDA and ERC. We are significantly larger than the second largest such credit management company in Europe. For the twelve 2 ----- months ended June 30, 2020, our Pro Forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA was SEK 11,246 million (€1,055 million equivalent). We believe our size gives us several benefits. In particular, our broad and in-depth experience favorably impacts our ability to develop optimal collection strategies and competitively price portfolios in our portfolio investment activities, which we believe has a positive impact on our revenue and efficiency. Additionally, our size allows us to better absorb fixed costs, compared to smaller companies, including those related to regulatory and legal compliance and information technology (“IT”), which further benefits our margins. We also believe that our scale, leading positions, full scope of services across the entire CMS value chain and our broad geographic footprint allow us to provide an increasingly attractive value proposition for our largest clients, who provide us with increasing sources of opportunities across Europe and enable us to efficiently allocate capital to opportunities with the best risk/reward profiles. _Market leading position in several European countries_ We are present in 24 European countries, which is more than any of our European competitors. Based on our internal estimates, we believe we hold a leading position in the majority of those countries. We believe our broad geographic footprint combined with strong local market positions is a competitive advantage which continues to enhance our ability to serve our existing clients with a complete value proposition across diverse markets and the entire CMS value chain and also to expand client relationships. _Leading position in the European financial institutions segment_ Based on our internal estimates, we believe that we hold one of the leading positions among credit management providers with respect to financial institutions clients in Europe. We believe that the financial institutions segment in Europe continues to represent one of the most attractive segments of the credit management market. Financial institutions are the largest originator of debt and, based on data from the EBA, European bank NPL stock amounted to approximately SEK 7 trillion (€0.6 trillion equivalent) as of December 31, 2019. The financial institutions segment also offers attractive economics with long durations and high earnings visibility. We have a long track record of collecting on NPLs and have built long-term relationships with European financial institutions. During the three years ended December 31, 2019, we acquired NPLs with a total collectible value on portfolio investments of SEK 441,895 million (€42,298 million equivalent) from European financial institutions. For the year ended December 31, 2019, 80% of revenue in our Portfolio Investments segment was generated by portfolios acquired from financial institutions. In addition, we have a strong track record in entering into strategic partnerships with financial institutions, including long-term servicing contracts and often the carve-out of operational servicing platforms. _Leading position in the European trade segment for credit management services and portfolio investments_ Based on our internal estimates, we believe that we hold a leading position among credit management providers in providing servicing and acquisition of overdue trade receivables (“OTR”) to non-financial services companies in Europe. The OTR segment complements the financial institutions segment as it offers a relatively stable and high volume of stock with short duration. In many of the markets in which we operate, we believe OTR flow will remain relatively consistent with historic high levels, driven by a structural shift towards a higher proportion of pay-later payment options, including invoice payments, installment payment plans and checkout payment plans, which are pay-later plans provided by Klarna, a Swedish online financial service provider which handles customer payments, and financing options, and increased outsourcing of CMS operations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521
151,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Our Strengths,9.4.2,Europe’s most diversified credit management company,"_Complete value proposition_ In addition to having the widest European geographic footprint, we believe that we have the European market’s broadest value proposition across the CMS value chain, including financial services, enabling us to operate as a “one-stop shop” for our clients. Our predominant activities are in the CMS and portfolio investments spheres. Additionally, within our Credit Management Services segment and Strategic Markets segment, we offer clients attractive value-added services before loans and receivables become overdue, including information, invoice and payment services, which are an important source of origination for our Credit Management Services segment, Strategic Markets segment and Portfolio Investments segment and for our data collection. Our broad product and value proposition is complemented by our ability to offer flexible solutions to our clients, including by leveraging our market-leading capabilities in the carving-out of financial institutions’ in-house collection units, co-investment structures and the provision of RES. 3 ----- _Ability to acquire and service several types of loans_ Historically, we have focused on unsecured consumer debt originated by financial institutions and OTRs originated by the non-financial sector. In recent years, we have also increased our activities in the secured consumer debt market segment, including through key acquisitions such as the June 2016 acquisition of 85% of Aktua Soluciones Financieras Holdings, S.L. and its subsidiaries (“Aktua”), one of the leading credit management companies in the secured NPL segment in Spain, with Banco Santander (“Santander”) holding the remaining 15%, which strengthened our RES capabilities in the Spanish market, in particular with regard to servicing Intrumor third-party owned real estate, the purchase of a real estate portfolio from Ibercaja in December 2018, which we hold with a co-investor, which bolstered our REO capabilities in the Spanish market and our acquisition in April 2019, of 80% of Solvia, which offers real estate management services in the Spanish market and which further built out our RES capabilities. We now work with secured assets in 12 countries, further demonstrating our capabilities across diverse types of loans.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521
151,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Our Strengths,9.4.3,"Integrated client offering spanning the Credit Management Services, Strategic Markets and Portfolio Investments segments","_Data analytics_ Our broad value proposition allows us to collect data from across the CMS value chain and extract data synergies to continuously strengthen our data analytics capabilities. We believe data analytics and business intelligence are key to driving optimized collection strategies and accurately and competitively pricing the portfolios for which we bid. We estimate that we have collected depersonalized data on over 285 million claims from across our three segments. We also estimate that we have a data warehouse consisting of over 7.3 billion events, such as payments and actions taken, associated with the claims on which we have collected depersonalized data. _Operational synergies_ The combined scale we achieve through the breadth of our value proposition as well as our pan-European footprint provides us with economies of skill and scale. Given the scalable nature of our business model, operational synergies are important drivers of increased operational efficiency. We have successfully recognized significant cost synergies associated with the Merger. In the year ended December 31, 2019, the process of realizing the synergies from the Merger was completed with these amounting to SEK 680 million (€65 million equivalent), exceeding the SEK 560 million (€59 million equivalent) expected at the time of the Merger. See “—Our _Strategy—Continue to drive profitability through operational excellence and realization of operational synergies.” Financial complementarity_ With our integrated and balanced business model we can solve for our clients’ needs and offer a value proposition across the CMS value chain. Additionally, we benefit from the financial complementarity between our Credit Management Services segment and Strategic Markets segment, on one hand, and our Portfolio Investments segment, on the other hand, whereby capital light revenues from the Credit Management Services segment (SEK 4,559 million (€428 million equivalent) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020) and Strategic Markets segment (SEK 4,819 million (€452 million equivalent) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020) generate cash which can be deployed in our Portfolio Investments segment for portfolio investments and deleveraging.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521
151,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Our Strengths,9.4.4,Diversified origination platform,"_Pan-European presence, multi-sector and transaction structure capabilities_ Our pan-European presence, with operations in 24 European countries, enables us to efficiently allocate capital to opportunities with the best risk/reward profiles. We have capabilities with respect to financial institutions as well as across multiple trade sectors, including utilities, telecommunications and retail, which allows flexible capital deployment for portfolio investments and enhance our ability to identify and take advantage of trends in various sectors across our segments. Furthermore, we benefit from our significant successful experience in executing co-investments which provides us with the resources to swiftly capitalize on market opportunities, allowing us to acquire larger and more mixed portfolios. Additionally our centrally organized Alternative Asset Group (“AAG”), which focuses on secured and sizeable B2B transactions, gives us the capacity and capability to address large, complex and sensitive transactions, as well as centrally coordinate and attract co-investors and secure additional sources of funding, as demonstrated by our Intesa Partnership and the 4 ----- acquisition of Ibercaja’s REO portfolio, which we hold with a co-investor. In addition to these transactions generating revenues, these transactions also act as growth accelerators by generating subsequent contracts to service the acquired portfolios, while requiring a lower level of upfront capital investment. Our extensive pan-European presence also allows us to provide CMS services to, and increase our share of wallet with, clients who have cross-border and cross-service activities. _Long-term relationships with our CMS clients_ We have an impressive track record of maintaining long-term relationships with our largest clients and we have also historically achieved high levels of repeat purchases from existing customers, which we believe evidences the strength of our product and value proposition. Of our 10 largest clients in the Credit Management Services segment, 5 have had a relationship with us lasting more than 10 years, of which 4 have had a relationship of more than 15 years and the relationship with our largest client in this segment extends beyond 25 years. _Large number of repeat and small purchases_ For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, we purchased SEK 1,449 million (€136 million equivalent) of loans and other overdue receivables under forward flow contracts, providing visibility on new business origination. Additionally, over the same period, we made SEK 595 million (€56 million equivalent) of smaller purchases of portfolios of less than SEK 20 million (€2 million equivalent) in size. As of June 30, 2020, our average portfolio investment claim size was SEK 20,218 (€1,929 equivalent). _CMS enables a competitive tendering process benefitting the portfolio investment part of our business_ When bidding for portfolios from existing clients in our Credit Management Services segment and Strategic Markets segment, we are able to leverage our existing business relationship, we can accurately and competitively price portfolios that we find attractive and offer an attractive value proposition to clients that is informed by our knowledge of, and provision of other services to, the specific client and portfolio. _Significant supply of NPLs in the market_ Based on data from the EBA, European bank NPL stock amounted to approximately SEK 7 trillion (€0.6 trillion equivalent) as of December 31, 2019, representing more than 1.5 times the 2007 levels. We expect continued regular and pro-active sales by banks as they manage a broad range of new rules and regulations such as, for example, Basel IV, IFRS 9 and ECB calendar provisioning. As a result, we anticipate an increase in debt sales as a proportion of NPL stock. Ultimately, the evolution of NPL stock depends on the macroeconomic situations of the countries in question. For example, in a favorable macroeconomic environment, NPL generation is more muted, as evidenced by NPL levels over the last few years. Following a downturn, such as is currently being experienced on a global level in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we would generally expect an increase in the generation of new NPLs. For further discussion of key NPL supply drivers, see “Industry Overview—Key _Drivers of the Credit Management Industry.” For further discussion of COVID-19, see “—Recent Developments— COVID-19” and “Risk Factors—Risks related to our industry and business—The COVID-19 pandemic, or other similar outbreaks, may adversely affect our business and exacerbate other risks discussed in this “Risk Factors” section.”_",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

We have historically undertaken a range of initiatives aimed at improving our collection and margins and that we believe will continue to improve the performance of our business. These include, among other things: - _standardization: consolidating infrastructure among subsidiaries, aligning operational processes and reducing the number of physical collection sites and IT and virtual collection systems; - _data management:_ centralizing data pools and implementing data cleansing techniques and analytical tools to support enhanced decision-making; - _digitalization and automation: investing in self-service consumer and client portals and software to facilitate timely and transparent communication and proactive management of credit management services; and 5 ----- - _shared services:_ consolidating and near-shoring shared services and continuing to evaluate expansion to additional service centers, with our shared service centre more than doubling in size since year-end 2017.

Through the breadth and depth of our experience across the CMS value chain, we have access to comprehensive databases of purchased and serviced debt to which we apply our data analysis capabilities in order to take a centralized approach to forecasting and pricing. Our centralized forecasting and pricing is further supported by specialist local input, ensuring that the pricing of each portfolio benefits from a strong cross-organizational evaluation. Our data capabilities also facilitate more efficient debt collection strategies through data analytics and cross-learning. In addition, our three-tiered risk management approach helps ensure that our sophisticated pricing information is used in an investment decision-making context that is grounded in compliance and the maintenance of strong internal controls. Our focus on risk management and compliance is incorporated into our structure at the local level, which is our first line of defense, and up through both the internal and independent external risk control and auditing functions that are carried out at our executive and Board levels. All of our portfolio acquisitions are subject to a standardized process involving independent review by our risk function, which reports to our Chief Risk Officer, and our investment authority, which reports to our Chief Investment Officer (both the Chief Risk Officer and Chief Investment Officer, together with other relevant stakeholders, are part of our Risk and Investment Committee), with the largest transactions requiring approval by our Board of Directors. We believe that our focus on pricing discipline and risk management has historically enabled us to consistently outperform our forecasted collections. From January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2020, on a quarterly basis, we collected 103 – 115% of our cash flow forecasts. Additionally, we believe our diverse business model allows us to remain comparatively resilient in the face of a global economic crisis (such as the one caused by the COVID-19 pandemic).",N/A,as_expected,2020,521
151,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Our Strengths,9.4.7,Resilient financial performance with strong cash generation,"_Track record of stable EBITDA growth_ We have a track record of delivering EBITDA growth and maintaining a stable and high EBITDA margin. In the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we reported Adjusted Cash EBITDA of SEK 10,655 million, SEK 9,236 million and SEK 6,339 million, respectively. In the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, our Adjusted Cash EBITDA increased to SEK 11,013 million compared to SEK 9,632 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019. In the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we maintained an EBITDA margin of 21%, 36% and 34%, respectively. The decrease in EBITDA margin during the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily a result of a revaluation of the portfolio. In the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, our EBITDA margin decreased to 15% compared to 40% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, with the decrease largely driven by the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially mitigated by our efficiency improvement program and other cost savings initiatives and the resiliency of our platform. See “Recent Developments—COVID-19.”_ We believe our results of operations will continue to be positively impacted by our resilient business model, operating leverage and ongoing cost savings initiatives. _Stable cash flows and a unique dataset from the capital light Credit Management Services and Strategic Markets segments_ Our Credit Management Services segment, which requires relatively limited investment, generates stable cash flows and is supported by long-term client relationships. As of June 30, 2020, our Credit Management Services segment managed third-party debt with a combined total collectible value on third-party debt of SEK 205,345 million (€19,593 million equivalent). 6 ----- Furthermore, our Strategic Markets segment benefits from long-term servicing contracts in Greece, Italy and Spain related to carve-out transactions with financial institutions. As of June 30, 2020, our Strategic Markets segment managed third-party debt with a combined total collectible value on third-party debt of SEK 913,144 million (€87,129 million equivalent). We also benefit from system integration with clients associated with the provision of our services, making it unattractive from the client perspective to switch credit management companies. Overall, we tend to experience strong client loyalty and limited attrition. _Significant cash flows embedded in investment portfolios_ As of June 30, 2020, our estimated remaining collections (“ERC”) was SEK 64,674 million (€6,162 million equivalent). We have made significant portfolio investments over the past three years. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we acquired portfolios for SEK 7,324 million, SEK 11,854 million and SEK 7,223 million, respectively. We expect these investments to generate significant cash flows over the coming years. We have a long track record of outperforming our initial collection forecasts during the initial forecast period up to 15 years as well as a track record of extending collection periods beyond 15 years. _Strong cash generation with efficient conversion of profit into cash flow_ For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, we spent SEK 665 million and SEK 499 million, respectively (€62 million and €48 million equivalent, respectively), representing 6% and 4%, respectively, of our _Pro Forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA on capital expenditures other than capital expenditures related to portfolio_ investments and M&A activities. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, our total portfolio investments were SEK 7,528 million and SEK 10,809 million, respectively (€707 million and €1,035 million equivalent, respectively).

We aim to continue to build scale, lead in all markets where we operate, create value for clients, and achieve operational excellence in everything we do.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521
151,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Our Strategy,9.5.2,Continue to operate an integrated business model providing a complete value proposition,"We believe that we continue to be well-positioned for growth and continue to offer complete credit management solutions for our clients across asset classes and sectors based on our integrated and balanced business model. Key features of our growth strategy include: 7 ----- - _Full client offering providing integrated CMS and financial services solutions. We offer our clients both CMS and financial services solutions, providing them with the full scope of services across the CMS value chain. We believe that our complete value proposition, geographic footprint and scale are highly attractive to existing and potential clients. For example, our Intesa Partnership included entering into a long-term servicing contract and, through a joint venture, the acquisition of an NPL portfolio. Our Piraeus Partnership also included a long-term servicing contract and the acquisition of a leading independent service platform. See “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial _Condition and Result of Operations—Significant factors affecting results of operations—Acquisitions, geographic expansion and divestments.” These transactions demonstrate the breadth of our capabilities_ and the attractiveness of our value proposition to our clients. Furthermore, we see opportunities to increase our share of wallet with existing CMS clients by providing services to them throughout their geographic footprint and service needs. Additionally, our Credit Management Services and Strategic Markets segments provide us with deep insight into the portfolios of our clients and enables us to competitively price portfolios. - _Continued focus on acquisitions of unsecured NPL and expansion of consumer (“B2C”) debt, _secured debt and real estate services. Unsecured consumer NPL sales volumes have remained high_ as banks increasingly prefer to sell their debt to trusted debt collection agencies in order to clean up their balance sheets and focus on their core business. We expect a continued high level of NPL sales, given factors such as the growth in consumer lending and European Central Banks (“ECB”) regulation of NPLs. We expect to continue to deploy capital within the unsecured NPL space in order to gain scale in markets where we are not a leader and, to a lesser extent, to opportunistically enter new business areas. We expect to continue to partner with banks on bilaterally agreed large, complex and sensitive transactions, of which our Intesa Partnership and Piraeus Partnership are two recent examples. Additionally, secured NPL transactions have increased in recent years and represent a large portion of the NPL market. In December 2018, we completed the acquisition of 6,400 properties in Spain from Ibercaja, which we hold with a co-investor, bolstering our REO offering and presence in the secured NPL space, and, in April 2019, we completed the acquisition of Solvia, which offers real estate management services in the Spanish market, from Banco Sabadell, which further built out our ability to service Intrum- or third-party-owned secured NPLs. See “Management Discussion and _Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations—Significant factors affecting results of operations—Acquisitions, geographic expansion and divestments” and “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations—Description of key consolidated income statement line items—Participations in joint ventures.” We expect to continue to strengthen our_ capabilities with regard to the secured NPL markets and RES through greenfield operations and, where relevant, opportunistic acquisitions. We see growth potential from leveraging and exporting the capabilities we have developed with regard to secured markets and RES across many of the geographies in which we operate. - _Co-investments. In our Portfolio Investments segment, we see a pipeline in terms of the number and the size of investment opportunities available, which may outpace our on-balance sheet investment appetite. We consider flexible capital deployment initiatives, such as co-investment structures, which provide us with the ability to acquire larger, mixed portfolios by sharing risk with co-investment partners. Co-investments also increase the breadth of our origination platform by leveraging the network of our co-investment partners. These transactions, in addition to generating revenues from portfolio investments, also act as growth accelerators of third-party debt collection while requiring a lower level of upfront capital investment. - _Geographic expansion. We have a strong track record of expansion into new business areas and expanding our presence within existing markets. We have established operations in 25 countries, including through partnerships and strategic transactions such as carve-outs and bolt-on acquisitions. Our Intesa Partnership established us as a leading player in late payments in Italy, one of Europe’s most attractive markets, and with our Piraeus Partnership we have created the first independent leading credit management platform in Greece. Based on EBA data, our geographic footprint covers 98% of European NPLs, as of December 31, 2019. We continuously assess market conditions, including changes in connection with COVID-19, to ensure we invest prudently and have decided to temporarily reduce our rate of investment and increase the yield requirements on new portfolio investments in order to increase cash flow in the business. Going forward, we will continue to proactively evaluate opportunities to gain market share in existing markets where we currently do not 8 ----- hold leading positions and, to a lesser extent, opportunistically enter new business areas, for example through carve-outs and targeted acquisitions. When entering new business areas, our strategy is typically based on a cautious first entry: we start small and increase our investments as our insight and experience in a particular market increases. Moreover, we often strengthen our local knowledge and databases through business acquisitions and/or carve-out transactions (as we have previously done in the United Kingdom, Spain, Poland, Italy and Greece). For example, one method we employ to enter a new market involves acquiring a company with existing debt servicing capabilities and data, operating the company to develop further knowledge and data capabilities and then leveraging this data and market knowledge to price and purchase debt in the newly entered market. Our investment and pricing strategy is characterized by strict pricing discipline and institutional investment processes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521
151,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Our Strategy,9.5.3,Continue to drive profitability through operational excellence and the realization of operational synergies,"We have a long history of commitment to operational excellence and the realization of operational synergies, each of which have enabled us to maintain our track record of high margins in an industry that has experienced significant price pressure in recent years. In the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we maintained an EBITDA margin of 21%, 36% and 34%, respectively. We continue to implement several initiatives to further drive efficiency and increase our profitability going forward, including: - _Operational integration and portfolio management. We have identified four key operational levers which we continue to execute on: (i) utilization of shared services and scale opportunities, (ii) focus on IT effectiveness and efficiency, (iii) best-in-class sourcing and procurement and (iv) continuing to deploy best practices across our operations to maximize synergy opportunities. We seek to leverage scale and skills advantages and experience in data management, analytics, technology and digitalization to drive collection performance across our segments, seek better pricing and decrease costs and continue to see strong value potential in focusing on active portfolio management. - _Focus on pricing discipline, risk management and compliance. As a result of strict pricing discipline, institutionalized investment processes and operational improvements, from January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2020, on a quarterly basis, we have collected 103 – 115% of our cash flow forecasts. We intend to continue demonstrating a high level of underwriting discipline in order to maintain forecasting accuracy and to ensure that we only acquire portfolios that meet our investment return criteria. In addition, we seek to maintain our competitive advantage through continued early adoption of regulation and best-in-class compliance and risk management procedures. Our resilience throughout the COVID-19 crisis has demonstrated our agility and ability to respond to a rapidly changing hostile economic environment. Going forward this agility has the potential to positively impact our future cost structures. - _Realize operational synergies. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we completed the realization of Merger-related synergies, with realized synergies amounting to SEK 680 million (€65 million equivalent), exceeding the SEK 560 million (€59 million equivalent) expected at the time of the Merger. Realized cost savings related to optimization of operations centers, consolidation of administrative and support functions, harmonization of IT systems and application development and maintenance and increased scale in procurement. We have also capitalized on certain revenue synergies associated with the Merger from the combination of business intelligence operations and data sets, cross-selling of complementary offerings to existing clients, improved cross-border coverage of international clients and transfer of best practices. As part of our continuous efforts to increase our operational efficiency, we continue to identify and target strategic post-Merger efficiency and organizational transformation improvements to positively impact our bottom-line earnings. These additional efficiency programs may include activities such as prioritizing key IT projects, fully integrating newly acquired assets into our existing platform, and streamlining our daily operations and processes to ensure we benefit from the size and scale of our organization and deliver coordinated and seamless service to our clients. We are committed to identifying and pursuing ongoing cost-efficiency programs where they align with our operational objectives and growth strategies.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

Our internal standards are applicable to all employees.

151,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.6,Recent developments,9.6.1,COVID-19,"Our business has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The spread of COVID-19 has impacted our segmental and regional operations in different ways, with Strategic Markets segment being the most adversely affected, Credit Management Services segment maintaining a flat operating margin and Portfolio Investments segment being impacted primarily as a result of extending our collection forecasts. Financial performance in the Strategic Markets segment for the three months ended June 30, 2020 improved significantly when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020 financial performance due in part to the reopening of the court systems in Greece, Italy and Spain in May as well as by our strict internal cost control measures. Overall, for the six months ended June 30, 2020 operating income and operating margin in our Strategic Markets segment were SEK 447 million (€43 million equivalent) and 18% compared to SEK 575 million (€54 million equivalent) and 32% for the six months ended June 30, 2019. This decrease was largely driven by government measures taken in Italy and Spain to limit the spread of COVID-19, including restrictions on movement, shop closures and, in particular, reduced activity in the legal systems, which resulted in collections and cash flow delays in our operations. Operating income and operating margin in our Credit Management Services segment were SEK 803 million (€77 million equivalent) and 24% for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to SEK 844 million (€79 million equivalent) and 24% for the six months ended June 30, 2019. Financial performance in our Credit Management Services segment declined in the three months ended June 30, 2020 when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020, in part due to lower business volume flows as some clients have temporarily eased payment terms for their customers. Operating income and operating margin in our Portfolio Investments segment were SEK 1,406 million (€134 million equivalent) and 52% for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to SEK 2,520 million (€239 million equivalent) and 72% for the six months ended June 30, 2019, with the decrease primarily due to underperformance in overdue receivables collections by our Italian SPV. We extended our collection forecasts in the three months ended March 31, 2020, pushing back our expected collection timing. However, collections in the three months ended June 30, 2020 exceeded these revised collection forecasts. In the three months ended June 30, 2020, we also experienced marginally higher earnings from joint ventures and underwriting return levels that were materially higher than levels prior to COVID-19. We also believe that our pipeline of debt collection cases remains at a good level and, additionally, that our broad geographical presence and wide variety of client solutions gives us a high degree of diversification, which, together with our underlying cash flow generation, helps to mitigate some of the adverse effects of COVID19 on our results of operations. For further discussion, see “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial _Condition and Results of Operations—Significant factors affecting results of operations—Economic conditions”_ and “Risk Factors—Risks related to our industry and business—The COVID-19 pandemic, or other similar _outbreaks, may adversely affect our business and exacerbate other risks discussed in this “Risk Factors” section.”_ As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as previously disclosed, we have also revised our business plan for 2020 and are reconsidering our short- and mid-term financial targets as we no longer consider that conditions are in place to meet our original goals for 2020. Our financial results during the first six months of 2020 were positively impacted by the efficiency program implemented in 2019 but were also adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this negative impact, we continue to target a leverage ratio of 2.5-3.5x by year end 2022. See “Presentation of Financial Information—Financial targets.” We have also decided to temporarily reduce our rate of investment and increase the yield requirements on new portfolio investments in order to increase cash flow in the business. The health and safety of our employees is of paramount importance. The majority of our employees have been working from home since mid-March, demonstrating the commitment of our workforce and our ability to 10 ----- manage our business volumes remotely. To ensure that our core values remain the foundation of our operations, we have also strengthened our internal guidelines to ensure we are interacting with customers uniquely affected by COVID-19 on the basis of their individual circumstances and with an empathetic and ethical approach.

In November 2017, in connection with the Divestment, the Issuer agreed to divest certain subsidiaries to a company in the Lowell Group. The Divestment completed on March 20, 2018. In the income statement for the year ended December 31, 2018 (including comparative information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017), the subsidiaries being divested in accordance with the above have been reported as discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. In the balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 included as comparative information in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2018, these subsidiaries are reported as assets and liabilities in operations held for sale. For further information, see note 39 in the Issuer’s audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 and note 38 in the Issuer’s audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, each included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum We adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers from January 1, 2018 and IFRS 16 Leases from January 1, 2019. The financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 included in the Issuer’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 has not been restated to reflect the retrospective adoption of IFRS 15. None of the Audited Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, financial information for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 and financial information for the six months ended June 30, 2018 included in the unaudited financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2019 has been restated to reflect the retrospective adoption of IFRS 16. For further information, see “Presentation of Financial and Other Information,” “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition” and note 1 to the Audited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. This section includes certain LTM Information for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. This LTM Information has been calculated by adding the Issuer’s historical results for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, to the Issuer’s historical results for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and subtracting the Issuer’s historical results for the six months ended June, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The LTM Information has been prepared solely for the purposes of this Offering Memorandum, is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting and has not been audited or reviewed and the LTM information for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 does not reflect the application of IFRS 16 over the entire period. It is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily representative of the Issuer’s results of operations for any future period or its financial condition at any future date. In this section, we also present selected unaudited pro forma financial information and other data on an as adjusted basis to give effect to the Transactions that has been prepared based on the Financial Statements and assumptions described herein. The selected unaudited pro forma financial information and the other adjusted data have been included to describe a hypothetical situation and have been prepared for illustrative purposes only. The selected unaudited pro forma financial information and the other adjusted data do not include all of the information required for financial statements under IFRS. Future results may vary significantly from the results reflected because of various factors, including those discussed in “Risk Factors.” We present below certain non-IFRS financial measures such as EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted Cash EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA and EBITDA Margin because we believe they are important supplementary measures and that they are widely used by investors comparing performance between companies. As not all companies compute these non-IFRS financial measures in the same way, the manner in which our management has chosen to compute the non-IFRS financial measures presented herein may not be comparable with similarly defined terms used by other companies. These measures are not measures of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS, and they may not accurately reflect our performance, liquidity or our ability to incur or service debt. In this section, we also present various key operating metrics. We believe that these metrics are helpful in understanding our performance from period to period and facilitate comparison with our peers. These metrics are not measures of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to other_ 17 ----- _indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS.

While adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we operate may lead to higher default rates on claims, which in turn may increase the stock of portfolios available for us to purchase and the amount of loans and other overdue receivables possessed by our debt collection clients, there can be no assurances that increases in the amount of debt available to us for purchase and to service will compensate for the adverse effects that a general economic downturn, including in connection with the current COVID-19 pandemic, may otherwise have on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “—The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our business and _exacerbate other risks discussed within this section.” Should the economic conditions in the markets in which we_ operate deteriorate, we may not be able to perform debt collection at levels consistent with our historic levels due to the inability of customers to make payments at the same levels or at all, as was the case during the 2008-2010 economic downturn. Adverse economic conditions may also reduce the propensity of debt originators to sell overdue receivables as sale prices may be unfavorable during such periods. Furthermore, a material and adverse economic downturn could result in increased unemployment rates or could materially impact interest rates and restrict the availability of credit, resulting in decreased demand for our payment services. In addition, should the level of inflation increase, the real-term carrying value of our portfolio investments may decrease. There can be no assurances that economic conditions will improve in the markets in which we operate or that the net effect of any change in economic conditions will be positive. An improvement in the economic conditions in the markets in which we operate could impact our business and performance in various ways, including reducing the number of attractive portfolio opportunities available for purchase, increasing competition for those portfolios that are available to purchase at attractive prices and increasing competition for the provision of debt collection services. There can be no assurances that an improved economic environment will also result in positive developments in our business and results of operations. Accordingly, any of the above developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521
151,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our industry and business,13.1.2,"The COVID-19 pandemic, or other similar outbreaks, may adversely affect our business and exacerbate other risks discussed in this “Risk Factors” section.","In March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a “pandemic” by the Word Health Organization. The global spread of COVID-19 has caused significant business disruption, significant volatility in international debt and equity markets and significant disruption to the global economy as well as the particular markets in which we operate. Our Strategic Markets segment, which focuses on late payments and collections in Italy, Spain and Greece, has been particularly impacted by the direct impact of COVID-19 as well as by local government initiatives to curb the spread the COVID-19, including, for example, the partial closure of court and legal systems and the reduction in consumer spending associated with limitations on freedom of movement and temporary closures of non-essential businesses, which may lead to reduced customer debt going forward, all of which have a negative impact on our revenues and profitability. Similar government initiatives in the other jurisdictions in 27 ----- which we operate have also adversely impacted our results of operations in those jurisdictions. There is significant uncertainty globally, nationally and regionally around the breadth and duration of business disruptions related to COVID-19, as well as its impact on global and local economies and consumer confidence. The situation could deteriorate even further and the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including a new or second wave of infections in the regions in which we operate, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken or being continued to contain it or address its impact. The COVID-19 pandemic may also affect our business in ways which are difficult to predict. For example, in connection with COVID-19 or any governmental responses to COVID-19, we may experience, among other risks, increased currency and interest rate volatility, reduced access to external capital, increased cyber security threats as a result of phishing campaigns and targeted attacks and increased cyber security vulnerability and increased risk of data breaches due to remote working environments. The COVID-19 pandemic could have further material adverse effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition if: - the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic result in sustained deterioration in the economic environment in our regions and the amount of debt available to us for purchase and to service as a result does not compensate for the adverse effects; - political, legal and regulatory actions and policies in response to the pandemic, such as governmental actions or proposed actions limiting debt collection efforts and encouraging or requiring extensions, modifications or forbearance with respect to certain loans and fees, prevent us from performing our collection activities, result in material increases in our costs to comply with such laws and regulations or result in fewer debt portfolios coming to market; - disruptions to or closures of the court system and other disruptions due to the pandemic to or government restrictions on the legal process that hinder our ability to collect through the litigation process are prolonged or increased; - as a result of unemployment or reduced income or increased costs ensuing from the pandemic, consumers respond by failing to pay amounts owed on receivables owned or managed by us; - we are unable to maintain staffing at the levels necessary to operate our business due to the continued spread or increased virulence of COVID-19 or related coronavirus strains or resultant health complications, causing employees to be unable or unwilling to work; - we are unable to purchase debt portfolios needed to operate our business because debt owners become unable or unwilling to sell their nonperforming loans consistent with recent levels at attractive prices or at all; - adverse capital and credit market conditions increase our cost of capital or affect our ability to raise capital, and our cash generation is not sufficient for our needs; - tax rates are increased to fund the cost of various government initiatives initiated in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic; or - we suffer a cyber-security incident or data breach as a result of an increase in the number or severity of cyber-attacks, or increased vulnerability while a larger proportion of our employees work remotely. Due to the current conditions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and the global impact it has had, we no longer consider the necessary conditions to be in place to meet our original goals for 2020. In the six months ended June 30, 2020, we wrote down our portfolio investment by net SEK 633 million, which is 2.3% of our portfolio investment carrying value as of June 30, 2020. If, among other factors, the adverse impacts stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic were to cause our results of operations or cash flows to be worse than anticipated, we could conclude in future periods that additional impairment charges are required in order to reduce the carrying values of goodwill or other long-lived assets. For example, due to the current conditions surrounding the COVID19 pandemic and the global impact it has had, we no longer consider the necessary conditions to be in place to meet our original goals for 2020. Any such future impairment charges could be significant. In addition to direct impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations and financial performance directly, the COVID 28 ----- 19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening other risks described in this ‘‘Risk Factors’’ section, including, but not limited to the risks described in “—We operate in a variety of jurisdictions and must comply _with applicable laws, regulations, licenses and codes of practice across these jurisdictions.

We face competition from new and existing debt collection providers, other purchasers of portfolios of overdue loans and other overdue receivables (including financial investors) and debt originators that manage their own portfolios rather than outsourcing or selling them. This competition includes, but is not limited to, competition on the basis of price. New market entrants and existing competitors may offer more attractive pricing levels for both debt collection contracts and debt portfolio purchases and may accept lower returns in order to gain or increase market share. There can be no assurances that this price competition will not result in us having to pay higher prices for portfolios that we purchase or charge less for our debt collection or other payment services than we have done historically or than we currently expect, each of which could decrease our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We face bidding competition in our acquisition of debt portfolios. We believe that successful bids are awarded based on price as well as a range of other factors, including service, compliance, reputation and relationships with the sellers of debt portfolios. Some of our current and potential competitors may have more effective pricing and collection models, greater adaptability to changing market needs or more established relationships in our industry or geographic markets. Moreover, our competitors may elect to pay prices for debt portfolios that we determine are not economically sustainable and as a result our volume of debt portfolio purchases may be diminished. In addition to competition from traditional credit management companies, we face competition from financial investors with respect to purchases of debt portfolios. Our current and potential financial investor competitors, including financial investors, may have access to greater financial resources with which to undertake portfolio investments, less expensive funding and lower return requirements than we have. There can be no assurances that our existing or potential debt portfolio sources will continue to sell debt portfolios at historic levels, or at all, that we will continue to offer competitive bids for debt portfolios or that in the future we will have the financial resources to offer competitive bids for portfolio purchases and debt collection contracts. There can be no assurances that we will be able to develop, manage and expand our business or adapt to changing market needs as well as our current or future competitors.

Any decrease in our ability to purchase debt portfolios or provide credit management services could materially and adversely affect our business.,"The demand for our credit optimization, payment and collection services and the availability of debt portfolios at prices that allow us to generate profits depend on a number of factors, some of which are outside of our control, including: - consumer spending levels, which have been impacted in the markets in which we operate by the COVID-19 pandemic (see “—The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our business and _exacerbate other risks discussed within this section”);_ 29 ----- - the availability of credit to consumers and consumers’ borrowing appetite, which is driven by a number of factors including general economic conditions, interest rates, heightened regulation of the credit card and consumer lending industry, changing credit origination strategies, tighter lending criteria introduced by consumer credit providers and changing individual and cultural attitudes toward funding spending with borrowing; - the level of non-performance on consumer debt portfolios and the proportion of such portfolios that are written off by originators, which may in turn affect the availability of credit to consumers identified above; - sales of debt portfolios by originators, which could be adversely impacted by a change in accounting policies or practices, the consolidation of credit card issuers or increased sophistication in internal collection efforts; - potential concerns that the value received for defaulted debt portfolios as a percentage of their total collectible value may not outweigh the potential reputational risks or required management attention associated with selling defaulted debt portfolios; - negative publicity or a loss of trust in our industry due to our failure, or the failure of one or more of our competitors, to meet legal, regulatory or other obligations; - increased government regulation of the circumstances in which originators, in particular regulated entities, have a right to collect on debt; and - the macroeconomic environments of the countries in which we operate. Originators may develop technological tools that could override the advantages we believe we currently possess in terms of tracing technology and customer profile development. If originators choose to perform more of their credit optimization in-house and to invoice and perform debt collections internally as a result of any data quality improvements, the demand for our credit management services and the volume of debt portfolio sales or the quality of underlying debt sold could decrease and, consequently, we may not be able to purchase receivables of the type, in the quantities or at prices consistent with our historical return targets. In addition, should industry shifts result in a reduction in the availability of debt portfolios sold early in the financial difficulty cycle and that have had little or no exposure to collections activity, there could be a corresponding increase in the total share of more mature debt, which is typically more challenging and expensive to collect when compared to “fresh” debt which typically has higher collection expectations as less work has been applied to the assets to obtain customer payments. If we are unable to purchase portfolios from originators at appropriate prices, or at all, or if one or more originators stop or decrease their demand for our credit management services due to one of the factors listed above or any other factors, we would lose a source of income which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

Concerns exist within the Eurozone with respect to individual macro fundamentals on a country by country basis. Adverse economic conditions and uncertainties, including any fines or penalties on European financial institutions and any potential resulting failures or consolidations of financial institutions, may adversely affect us by significantly reducing our client engagements. Additionally, adverse economic conditions could lead to a reduction in the propensity of financial institutions to lend to customers in the markets in which we operate as was the case during the global financial crisis (2008-2010). The above conditions may lead to a reduced supply of debt available for us to collect on or fewer opportunities for us to enter into forward flow agreements or value-added services, and may reduce our customers’ disposable income levels or otherwise impair their ability to fulfil their payment obligations. We can provide no assurance that the ongoing adverse economic impact associated with the COVID-19 pandemic will not result in similar constrictions in credit availability, client engagements and customers’ ability to comply with payment obligations.

The United Kingdom triggered Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon on March 29, 2017 and on January 31, 2020, the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU became effective. The United Kingdom entered into a transition period from January 31, 2020 to December 31, 2020 during which the EU will treat the United Kingdom as if it were still a member of the EU. We cannot predict how negotiations during this transition period will proceed, whether the transition period will be extended or what the United Kingdom’s relationship with the EU will be after the transition period ends. If the United Kingdom and the EU are unable to negotiate acceptable withdrawal terms or if other EU Member States pursue withdrawal, barrier-free access between the United Kingdom and other EU Member States or among the European economic area overall could be diminished or eliminated. Depending on the final terms of Brexit, the United Kingdom may lose access to the single European Market, which could result, among other things, in the disruption of free movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the EU, undermine bilateral cooperation in key geographic areas and significantly disrupt trade between the United Kingdom and the EU or other nations as the United Kingdom pursues independent trade relations. The exit of the United Kingdom or any other member state from the EU, or the departure from the euro by one or more Eurozone countries, or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro entirely, could lead to a reduction in market confidence and a weakening of European financial institutions. A deterioration in political and economic conditions in the United Kingdom or the EU could result in increased unemployment rates, increased short- and long-term interest rates, consumer and commercial bankruptcy filings and a decline in the strength of national and local economies. In addition, Brexit may lead to an economic downturn in the United Kingdom and the EU generally. Any reduction in consumers’ willingness or ability to pay their debts due to Brexit-related changes in the economic environment of the United Kingdom or the EU could materially affect our revenue and our ability to perform debt collection in a manner consistent with our past practice. Any fundamental shift in the macroeconomic environment in the United Kingdom or other parts of Europe in which we operate could adversely affect the accuracy of our predictions regarding the expected returns from the debt portfolios we purchase and service. See “—There may be insufficient supply of debt available or _debt available may not be appropriately priced for our needs or capacities.

Changes to the regulatory or political environments in which we operate may negatively affect our business.","_General_ We are subject to regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws and regulations regarding our listing on Nasdaq Stockholm, data protection, debt collection, debt purchasing, consumer credits, payment services, enhanced consumer protection and anti-money laundering and terrorist financing at the national and supranational level. See “Regulatory Overview.” As we increase our focus on certain business areas, such as secured loans or offering credit rescheduling agreements (installment plans), we become subject to additional regulatory requirements, including with respect to anti-money laundering and verifying ownership of underlying assets. There can be no assurances that our policies and procedures will prevent breaches of applicable laws and regulations or that our investigations will identify such breaches in a timely manner or at all. Any such delay or failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Adverse regulatory developments under the laws and regulations to which we are subject could expose us to a number of risks. In addition, from time to time we identify weaknesses in our internal policies, procedures and controls. We cannot assure you that in the future we will identify such weaknesses or, where we do, remedy any such 31 ----- weaknesses in a timely manner or at all. Any such delay or failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In a number of the markets in which we operate, including, in particular, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Greece, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom, the regulation of financial undertakings is in all material respects similar to the rules applicable for banks (including in respect of capital adequacy requirements). As a consequence, these financial undertakings may be subject to new or amended legislation from the EU or relevant jurisdictions applicable to banks, including new or amended capital requirements and liquidity requirements. Such new or amended legislation or interpretation could, under certain circumstances, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions. Supervisory authorities in each country in which we operate may determine that we do not fully comply with, are currently in violation of or in the past have violated applicable rules, regulations or administrative guidelines. Any such determination could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. _Non-performing loan directive_ In March 2018, the European Commission (the “EC”) proposed a comprehensive package as part of the EU Action Plan to tackle NPLs. The EC believes one of the key areas for reducing risk in the European banking sector is to further decrease the number of NPLs on banks’ balance sheets. The package put forward by the EC contains policy actions in four areas: (i) increased bank supervision and regulation, (ii) further reforms of national restructuring, insolvency and debt recovery frameworks, (iii) developing secondary markets for distressed assets and (iv) fostering, as appropriate and necessary, the restructuring of banks. Continued efforts by the EU to reduce the number of NPLs on the balance sheets of banks could lead to a reduction in the number of debt portfolios available for purchase and could increase competition for those portfolios which are available. The European Parliament’s review of the package has been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but we believe it will resume in the near- to medium-term. There can be no assurance that the impact of these regulations or others like them enacted or imposed in other jurisdictions will not impede our ability to conduct our operations, result in further litigation or have a negative impact on our business. _Data protection_ We are subject to various regulatory requirements regarding data protection in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such regulatory requirements differ from country to country. In the past, regulatory authorities have imposed fines on certain of our subsidiaries for non-compliance with data protection regulations and we cannot assure you that similar fines will not be imposed in the future. The imposition of any such fines or any other sanctions by regulatory authorities may have negative consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In particular, if it turns out that any business activity we conduct is non-compliant, we may be ordered to cease such business activity until the breach is cured. Changes to data protection laws and regulations or changes to their interpretation by data protection authorities and courts may reduce our operational flexibility and limit our ability to collect, retain or use our customer data to price portfolios and create efficient debt collection strategies. On April 27, 2016, the regulation on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation, the “GDPR”) was adopted by the European Parliament and the European Council. The GDPR became directly applicable in all EU Member States on May 25, 2018, and replaced Directive 95/46/EC and existing national data protection legislation and was also implemented in EEA countries and the United Kingdom with effect from the same date. The GDPR significantly changed the EU/EEA and United Kingdom data protection landscape, including strengthening of individuals’ rights, stricter requirements on companies processing personal data and stricter sanctions with substantial administrative fines. The GDPR also offers data subjects the option to let a privacy organization litigate on their behalf, including collecting the potential damages. The GDPR regime imposes a substantially higher compliance burden on the credit management industry, including on our operations. While we have put in place rules, policies and procedures aimed at achieving compliance with the GDPR there can be no assurance that such rules, policies and procedures will be successful in ensuring compliance with GDPR. Any failure to comply with the GDPR could result in sanctions, penalties or other negative consequences which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we could lose a competitive advantage and our business could be negatively affected if current governmental regulations were to change such that certain of the information or customer data that we use becomes public, the countries where we operate introduce measures that have the effect of facilitating the tracing of customers or allowing credit market participants direct access to credit 32 ----- information before the purchase of portfolios or to prohibit us from using customer data in the manner or to the extent currently used. _Statutes of limitation_ In most of the countries in which we currently have local operations, we are able to extend the statutes of limitation on historic debt claims by taking legal action, notifying the customer or otherwise interrupting the limitation period. Some of the countries in which we operate have in recent years changed the statutes of limitation for certain debt including by limiting the ability to extend or interrupt the limitation period, or have discussed such changes. There can be no assurances that we would be successful in adjusting our operations to these or other similar regulatory changes. _Consumer protection_ The credit management industry could be subject to increased scrutiny due to local political factors and developments, which could in turn lead to changes in laws and regulations. The area of consumer credit has recently come under increased regulatory focus by national governments. For instance, caps on interest rate and penalties or sanctions for defaulted loans or total cost of credit have been introduced in several of the countries in which we operate. Such legislation may also be introduced in other jurisdictions and such restrictions can materially affect the consumer credit market as lenders derive a large portion of their profits from credit costs. Stricter regulations regarding installment plans have also been or in the future may be enacted or imposed by court ruling in countries in which we operate. For example, a March 2019 ruling by the Court of Justice of the EU held, in a case originating from Spain, that certain accelerated repayment clauses of mortgages found to be unfair cannot be maintained in part, with those elements which make it unfair are removed, where removing those elements would amount to altering the substance of the clause. Further, the ruling empowers national courts of EU Member States or the United Kingdom to replace those terms found unfair with legislative provisions where their inclusion is necessary for the continued existence of the loan contract and annulment of such contract would make expose the consumer to unfavorable consequences. As a result of this ruling, increased uncertainty exists on our ability to enforce collection terms on business to consumer secured loans. There can be no assurance that the impact of these regulations or others like them enacted or imposed in other jurisdictions will not impede our ability to conduct our operations, result in further litigation or have a negative impact on our business. _Debt collection_ Licensing requirements for debt collection services differ from market to market. Many markets have a licensing requirement and supervision of compliance. In December 2016, the European Court of Justice (Third Chamber) ruled that a debt collection agency which concludes a rescheduling agreement for an unpaid credit on behalf of a lender but which acts as a credit intermediary only in an ancillary capacity must be regarded as being a credit intermediary and is not subject to the obligation to provide the consumer with pre-contractual information. Following the ruling, some countries in the EU have required debt collection companies that offer installment plans to hold a consumer credit license so as to be bound by the relevant EU directive. Such license requirements have already been imposed in some countries in which we operate, including Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Although large incumbent credit management providers tend to be better placed to comply with a high regulatory burden, stricter regulations in general may increase our compliance burden and operating costs. Any temporary or permanent revocation of our debt collection licenses by the licensing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Many of the countries in which we operate have also implemented regulations providing limitations on costs for debt collection and duties of disclosure to consumer customers.

We are also subject to regular audits by the regulatory authorities in various countries in which we operate. An adverse outcome of any such investigation or other inquiries from regulatory authorities may result in: 33 ----- - the institution of administrative, civil or criminal proceedings; - sanctions and the payment of administrative fines and penalties, including potential suspension or revocation of regulatory licenses depending on the severity and scale of any regulatory issues; - changes in personnel, management or Board of Directors; - our inability to conduct business due to the loss of our regulatory license or restrictions or conditions being placed on our activities; - increased review and scrutiny of our services by our clients, regulatory authorities and others; and - negative media publicity and reputational damage. Individual employees may act against our policies or instructions and either inadvertently or deliberately violate applicable law and regulations, including competition, anti-corruption and anti-money-laundering laws and regulations by engaging in prohibited activities such as price fixing or colluding with competitors or breaching our internal policies. In addition, because we delegate a number of operational responsibilities to our subsidiaries and our local managers retain substantial autonomy regarding the management of our operations in their markets, we may face an increased likelihood of some or all of the risks described above occurring. Our internal governance policies and instructions may prove to be ineffective and, even if they are effective, there can be no assurance that we will not experience incidents of accounting or operating irregularities, accounting misstatements or any of the risks described above. Such actions have occurred in the past and if they were to occur in the future they may harm our reputation and, if we are held responsible, the resulting administrative fines and other sanctions (civil or criminal) could be substantial. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, any companies we seek to acquire in the future or the employees of such companies may not operate in accordance with the law, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to detect or remedy any such non-compliance before such acquisition is complete or thereafter. Acquiring other businesses is a core component of our business strategy and we have incurred expenses associated with investigating and remedying legal non-compliance among companies that we have acquired in the past. The foregoing risks are particularly relevant in the cases of acquisitions of companies, operations or employees in non-traditional and emerging markets and jurisdictions. Compliance with the regulatory framework requires dedicated time and resources. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and rules or with contractual compliance obligations could result in investigations and enforcement actions, requisite licenses being revoked, not being renewed or being made subject to more onerous or disadvantageous conditions, fines or the suspension or termination of our ability to conduct collections. In addition, such failure to comply or revocation of a license, or other actions by the Company may damage the reputation of our clients. Damage to our reputation, whether because of a failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or internal rules, or revocation of a license or any other regulatory action or our failure to comply with a contractual compliance obligation, could deter vendors, particularly large financial institutions, which represent a significant proportion of our clients and vendors, from choosing us as their debt purchasing provider.

Our business is subject to local market risks due to our operations in multiple European markets and Brazil, including risks relating to multiple national and local regulatory and compliance requirements, labor, licensing requirements, consumer credit, data protection, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and terrorist financing and other regulatory regimes, potential adverse tax consequences, antitrust regulations, an inability to enforce remedies in certain jurisdictions and geopolitical and social conditions in certain sectors of relevant markets. As and when we enter new markets, we may face additional risks, including incurring start-up losses for several years due to lower levels of business, ramp-up and training costs, the lack of expertise and loss of key employees in such markets, differences in business cultures and practices, the lack of adequate and available management teams to monitor and integrate these operations, unfavorable commercial terms and difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, control procedures and policies. 34 ----- Any negative impact caused by the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, as we expand into new jurisdictions, our business will be subject to applicable laws, regulations and licensing requirements in those new jurisdictions, which may be different or more stringent than the jurisdictions in which we currently operate.

Our reputation is important to maintaining our relationships with current and potential clients, in particular financial institutions, and with regulators. The following events, among others, could have a negative effect on our reputation and financial results: (i) negative media publicity relating either to us or the wider credit management industry; (ii) allegations of unethical or improper behavior by us or any of the third parties we use in the collection process; (iii) inability to collect debts on an accurate and timely basis; (iv) failure to respect and treat customers fairly; (v) failures in our collection and data protection processes; (vi) the actions of third parties that we engage in the debt collection process; (vii) failure in our IT platform, in particular IT security; or (viii) other operational issues, litigation, regulatory restrictions, investigations, fines or enforcement actions. The collection of debt, particularly historic debt, involves complex interpretations and calculations of contractual terms that may vary by client and country and which may impact the calculation of customers’ resulting payment obligations and the collection strategies we employ. There can be no assurances that the inherent complexity of debt calculation and historical inaccuracies will not result in any errors in our calculations of customers’ payment obligations in the future, which could generate negative press. We are a party to a number of co-investment arrangements related to the purchase of debt portfolios with financial investors or other financial institutions and we may continue to enter such arrangements in the future. In certain cases the co-investor may retain a majority of the investment and, as a result, control over the investment venture. We may have limited insight into and control over the governance of such co-investments or joint ventures and are therefore subject to reputational and other risks related to actions of co-investors or co-venture partners that are beyond our control. Any of the foregoing could result in financial liability or reputational damage which could jeopardize our relationships with our clients or ability to establish new client relationships, have a negative impact on our customers’ willingness to pay debts owed to us or to our clients, diminish our attractiveness as a joint venture or co-investment counterparty or lead to increased regulations of the credit management industry, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

Under most of our debt collection contracts we are not paid until the customer begins paying on the claim and we may be unable to accurately predict the costs or identify the risks or complexity of services associated with these contracts, which may result in lower than expected margins, losses under the contracts or even the loss of clients. Our contracts for debt collection services also subject us to penalty clauses, benchmark clauses, extraordinary termination clauses and change of control provisions. If we are unable to satisfy the terms of our contracts, the contracts may be terminated and we may lose clients and revenue. A number of our long-term debt service agreements are subject to early termination rights on the part of the customer that, if exercised, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our contracts for debt collection may be terminated by the client for reasons unrelated to our performance (for example in the event of a change of control in its ownership or sale of the underlying portfolio, as occurred in Spain and Italy in 2018 and 2019). In such circumstances we may be entitled to compensation, but there can be no assurance that such compensation will fully reflect all losses suffered. Many of our debt collection contracts have a stated term, typically one to two years, and, in some cases, termination clauses permitting the client to cancel the contract at the client’s discretion following the expiration of an agreed notice period. There can be no assurances that our clients will not exercise their rights to terminate 35 ----- their contracts prior to expiration or that we will be successful in negotiating new contracts with clients when such contracts expire. In addition, we are also exposed to unforeseen changes in the scope of existing contracts, including changes in prices or volumes due to changes in the general business or political landscape of our clients. Most of our debt collection contracts do not have volume commitments and a client can eliminate or reduce the volume of claims they outsource to us for debt collection without formally terminating the contract. We may have disputes or disagreements with our clients as to contract terms or the level of services we have agreed to provide. The potential impact of these risks may increase as we enter into larger contracts. If we are unable to fulfil our obligations under our contracts for any reason, we risk the loss of revenue and fees under that contract, the potential loss of a client and significant harm to our reputation. Any of our contracts could become more costly than initially anticipated and as a result we may experience significant increases in our operating costs or potential litigation. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521
151,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our industry and business,13.1.12,The value of our existing portfolios may deteriorate or we may not be able to collect sufficient amounts on our portfolios to take advantage of opportunities for portfolio purchases as they arise in the market.,"As the length of time involved in collecting on our existing portfolios may be extensive and the factors affecting debt collection rates may be volatile and outside our control, we may be unable to identify or cope with adverse economic trends, prevent the negative effects of changes in legislation (including tax legislation) or make changes in our purchasing strategies in a timely manner. If the assumptions we use in our models are incorrect, the relevant portfolio could lose value and could result in subsequent negative revaluations in our statement of financial position and a continuing deterioration in value over time as actual collections may deviate significantly from the collection estimates produced by our pricing model at the time of purchase. Such assumptions include but are not limited to an assumption that claims are not time barred, that the age and balances of purchased claims are correctly stated by the sellers, that customers are alive, that claims are not a result of fraud, money laundering or financing of terrorist activities and that accounts in a portfolio will generally behave in line with our models. In the six months ended June 30, 2020, we wrote down our portfolio investment by net SEK 633 million, which is 2.3% of our portfolio investment carrying value as of June 30, 2020. We purchase loans at significant discount to total collectible value on portfolio investments. These are typically loans that customers have failed to repay and, in many cases, that the client has deemed uncollectable. It is crucial for our business that we are able to identify portfolios that are of sufficient quality for us to determine that we are likely to collect on the claims. Clients generally make numerous attempts to recover on their overdue loans and other overdue receivables before selling them, often using a combination of in-house recovery efforts and third-party collection agencies. These overdue claims are difficult to collect and we may not collect a sufficient amount on the claims to cover the investment associated with purchasing the portfolios and the costs of running our business. There can be no assurances that any of the claims contained in our purchased portfolios will eventually be collected. Many of our claims are unsecured and an increase in bankruptcy filings involving customers could impact our ability to collect on those claims. Additionally, changes to bankruptcy, insolvency or other legislation in the markets in which we operate as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, including in the United Kingdom as a result of the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Bill and in the EU as a result of efforts to harmonize insolvency regimes across countries, could impact our ability to collect on claims. Further, contracts entered into with our clients for the purchase of debt portfolios may impose various restrictions on our realization of value from the portfolios and may restrict our flexibility in pursuing certain enforcement and collection activities. If the cash flows from our existing and future portfolios are less than anticipated, we may not have sufficient funds to purchase new portfolios, may have to pay a higher interest rate to finance the purchase of new portfolios or may have to accept lower returns on new portfolios. Any of the above could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The statistical models and data analysis tools that we use in our business may prove to be inaccurate, preventing us from achieving anticipated levels of returns, and we may be unable to appropriately identify and address underperforming portfolios. We use internally developed models and other data analysis tools extensively in our operations. For example, we use our experience-driven models to estimate collection curves in relation to potential portfolio purchases. However, these models and data analysis tools are subject to several limitations and may not be reliable. At the time of purchase, we are likely to have imperfect information about the precise age of the debt, the ability of the customer to pay, the time at which the customer is likely to pay and the cost required to service and collect on such debts. Moreover, our historical information about portfolios may not be indicative of the characteristics of subsequent portfolios purchased from the same client or within the same industry due to changes in business practices or economic developments. Further, the availability of relevant data varies from market to market. In addition, certain assets, such as secured loans, have different risk and collection profiles than the unsecured loans and receivables that have historically been our main focus. There is a significant amount of management judgment 36 ----- and estimation involved in purchasing and valuing portfolios and there can be no assurances that management judgments and estimates will prove to be accurate. Furthermore, there can be no assurances that we will be able to appropriately identify and address underperforming portfolios. In addition, our ability to properly price portfolios may be adversely affected if we have limited experience in purchasing the type of portfolio, operating in the particular region or dealing with the specific client involved. Lack of reliable information or incorrect assumptions can lead to mispricing of portfolios which may have an adverse effect on the financial return from the portfolios. Our statistical models and analysis tools assess information provided by third parties, such as credit information suppliers and other mainstream or public sources, or generated by software products. We have no control over the accuracy or sufficiency of information received from third parties. If such information is not accurate or sufficient, we could incorrectly price new portfolios or incorrectly value existing portfolios, set client prices or performance goals inaccurately or experience lower liquidation rates or larger operating expenses. Similarly, due to the nature of our business, we are not able to independently verify the quality of all of the debt claims we purchase, in particular with regard to forward flow debt purchase agreements, and we rely on representations made by our debt purchase clients. Any inaccuracy in these representations, including in relation to the validity of the debt claims, may result in a loss of revenue and we may not be successful in recovering such losses from our customers. There can be no assurances that any of the current or future loans contained in our portfolio investments will eventually be collected. If we are not able to achieve forecasted levels of collection, valuation impairments may be recognized, amortization may increase and revenue and returns on purchases of portfolios may be reduced. This may in turn impact our modeling for future collections, which is less reliable if we are not able to accurately predict the quantity and identity of customers who reduce their debt payments or the magnitude of such reductions. Furthermore, some of our contracts contain guaranteed solution rate commitments pursuant to which we guarantee a minimum level of collections to our clients. If we fail to reach these collection requirements, as has occurred in the past, we may have to make significant payments to such clients or such clients may reduce the amount of overdue loans and receivables that we are entitled to collect under these contracts. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on the competitive advantage we believe we have due to our data analytics capabilities and on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

Such reduced collections could negatively affect our ERC, while higher collection costs and lower portfolio returns would impact our results of operations and cash flows. Our forecast for future collections may be rendered less reliable if the quantity and identity of customers who may reduce their debt payments, or the amounts of such reductions, cannot be accurately predicted. If actual collections with respect to debt portfolios are significantly lower than our own projections when we purchased such portfolios, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

The availability of portfolios at prices that generate an appropriate return depends on a number of factors both within and outside of our control, such as the levels of overdue loans and other receivables, volumes of portfolio sales by clients and competitive factors affecting potential purchasers and debt originators. Additionally, an increase in demand for portfolios among competitors, including financial investors, could result in portfolios being sold to competitors. There can be no assurances that we will be able to identify a sufficient volume of portfolios at appropriate prices. If we are unable to identify portfolios at appropriate prices or of sufficient quality, we may have to purchase loans of asset types or in industries in which we have little or no experience, or in industries where it is more difficult to collect on overdue receivables due to secrecy requirements, for example in the healthcare or legal sector. Purchases of these asset types or in these industries may impair our ability to collect on these claims and 37 ----- we may consequently fail to generate a profit on these purchases. A potential inconsistency in the availability of portfolios for purchase may mean that during certain financial reporting periods we may make few or no purchases of debt. If we are unable to identify sufficient levels of attractive portfolios and generate an appropriate return on portfolio investments, we may experience difficulties covering such expenses and may, as a consequence, have to reduce the number of our collection personnel or take other measures to reduce costs. These developments could lead to disruptions in our operations, loss of efficiency, low employee morale and retention, fewer experienced employees and excess costs.

Our ability to obtain funding in the future from these sources will depend on our performance and prospects, as well as factors over which we do not exercise control. Such factors may include, among others, weak economic and capital market conditions during or prior to periods in which attractive portfolios are available for purchase, the ability and willingness of banks to lend to our industry generally or to us in particular and changes in fiscal, monetary and other government policies. There can be no assurances that the terms of our existing or future indebtedness will not limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness to fund such portfolio purchases. Additionally, our ability to purchase portfolios of debt using cash generated by our debt collection operations is highly affected by seasonal factors, including the number of work days in a given month, the propensity of customers to take holidays at particular times of the year and annual cycles in disposable income. Accordingly, collections within portfolios tend to have high seasonal variances, while our costs are more evenly spread out over the year, resulting in high variances of margins and profitability between quarters. Furthermore, our debt portfolio purchases are likely to be uneven during the year due to fluctuating supply and demand within the market. The combination of seasonal collections and costs and uneven purchases may result in low cash flow at a time when attractive debt portfolios become available. There can be no assurances that in the future we will be able to obtain interim funding from our shareholders, by making other borrowings or by partnering with coinvestors or co-venture partners at the time when attractive debt portfolios become available. A lack of cash flow could prevent us from purchasing otherwise desirable debt portfolios or prevent us from meeting our obligations under any forward flow agreements we may enter. An inability to procure sufficient funding or co-investments at favorable terms to purchase portfolios as they become available or meet our obligations under our forward flow agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

We may be required to compete to renew existing debt collection contracts that have in the past been awarded to us without competition or as to which we have historically been the incumbent provider of debt collection services. We may also be required to enter into debt collection contracts at price levels or with margins that are lower than we find acceptable. We may not be afforded the opportunity in the future to bid on debt collection contracts that are held by other companies and are scheduled to expire if the existing contract is extended. In addition, we cannot be certain that all of our existing customers will continue to use our debt collection services in the future, as occurred in our Spanish businesses in 2018 and 2019 and which had a material effect on CMS revenue in those jurisdictions.

A forward flow agreement is an arrangement in which we agree to purchase claims based on specific parameters from a third-party supplier on a periodic basis and at a set price over a specified time period. We could lose a potential source of income if we are unable to renew or replace volumes represented by our forward flow 38 ----- agreements upon their termination or expiration. We may be required to purchase debt under a forward flow agreement for an amount higher than we would otherwise have agreed at the time of purchase, which could result in reduced returns. In a more competitive environment, we could be faced with a decision to either decrease our purchasing volume or agree to forward flow agreements at increased prices or with less contractual protections, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations. We generally contemplate future fluctuations in the value of the debt that we purchase through forward flow agreements, but such fluctuations in value may exceed our expectations. If the quality of debt purchased varies from our pricing assumptions, we may also price the contract improperly. Forward flow agreements are typically not long-term contracts in nature and typically do not provide medium- to long-term assurance on purchasing levels. Commitments under forward flow contracts are typically not more than 12 months. However, depending upon the length of the contractual arrangements, forward flow agreements typically contain termination clauses that allow the arrangement to be terminated under specified circumstances. If we are unable to contractually terminate an agreement we may have to accept claims that are of a lower quality than what we intended to purchase, which could result in lower returns.

We may also expand these operations into other jurisdictions. This will likely result in our operations becoming increasingly complex and we must maintain and increase our competence within these areas in order to remain competitive and profitable. For example, SME loans have different pricing and collection profiles, RES on behalf of third-party clients is connected with and exposed to real estate prices and secured loans have different risk and collection profiles than unsecured loans and receivables. Secured loans and RES on behalf of third-party clients require different competence and data capabilities in order to price, service and manage such portfolios efficiently. Our ability to properly price and collect on SME, secured and real estate loans and receivables may be adversely affected by our limited experience in these areas, when compared to our more in depth experience in unsecured loans and receivables, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

The success of such acquisitions, strategic transactions and carve-out transactions is dependent upon, among others, appropriate due diligence, the negotiation of favorable terms and the eventual successful integration of the acquired businesses. It may take longer than anticipated to realize anticipated benefits from such acquisitions, carve-out transactions and other strategic transactions and there can be no assurances that we will be able to extract anticipated synergies or that such potential benefits will outweigh the associated costs. In addition, we may experience delays in integration processes. Further, acquisitions, carve-out transactions, and other strategic transactions may place additional constraints on our resources, including diverting the attention of our management from existing business operations to integration processes. As part of the Merger, we were required by the EU Commission to divest certain of Lindorff and Intrum Justitia’s businesses in Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Estonia and Norway respectively (the “Divestment”). As part of the sale of Lindorff’s operations in Denmark, Estonia, Finland and Sweden as well as Intrum Justitia’s historic operations in Norway (the “Carve-out Business”) to the Lowell Group in March 2018 in accordance with the EU Commission’s terms for permitting the Merger we were required to enter into three-year brand licensing agreements with the purchaser for the “Lindorff” brand in Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Estonia and the “Intrum Justitia” brand in Norway. Following the Divestment, we no longer control the use of such brands in the jurisdictions subject to the licensing agreements and cannot assure you that the licensee under such agreement will refrain from operating the Carve-out Business in a manner that would cause reputational damage to the Company. Any of the risks associated with our lack of control over such licensee, or their use of the Lindorff and 39 ----- Intrum Justitia brands, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. We have historically expanded through both external and organic growth and we may continue to grow by selectively identifying potential acquisitions of portfolios and businesses as well as carve-out opportunities with respect to collection units. If we do acquire other businesses or complete other carve-out transactions, we may not be able to successfully integrate these businesses and assets with our own and we may be unable to maintain our standards, controls and policies which may result in compliance issues, goodwill write-offs and damage to our reputation. For example, when integrating new businesses and collection units, we face costs and security risks due to the need to integrate the IT platform of the purchased company or carved-out operations into our existing IT platform. Additionally, if we purchase a large portfolio we may be unable to successfully integrate it into our existing operations, the successful integration of the portfolio may take longer than anticipated or the costs associated with successfully integrating it may be higher than anticipated. Further, we are subject to the risks associated with write-downs and impairments of goodwill in connection with acquisitions. Our growth strategy includes opportunistically entering into new geographies or new business areas through selective acquisitions and carve-outs that we believe will complement and enhance our pan-European value proposition. For instance, in February 2017, we completed our acquisition of 1st Credit Limited and its subsidiaries, which we subsequently renamed Intrum UK Limited (“Intrum UK”), an acquisition which marked our re-establishment of operations in the United Kingdom market, in October 2017 we entered the Greek market by acquiring a debt portfolio from Eurobank and in July 2018 we expanded into Brazil when we acquired a majority shareholding position in the credit management company iPlatform. In addition, in October 2019, as part of the Piraeus Partnership, we acquired 80% of Piraeus Bank’s Recovery Banking Unit in combination with a long-term non-performing exposures servicing agreement. Piraeus Bank owns the remaining 20% of the partnership company. Integrating recently acquired business and achieving the expected operational synergies will require the dedication of management resources that may temporarily divert attention from our day-to-day operations and we may face unforeseen challenges in operating within unfamiliar commercial, cultural and regulatory environments. For example, following the acquisition of the portfolio of receivables from Erste Bank Hungary, amendments to local legislation affected the process through which collections on assets may be achieved and we were required to adapt our expectations to account for this change accordingly. The failure to successfully integrate recently acquired business or to manage our entry into new geographies or business areas generally could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurances that we will be able to manage our growth effectively and that our infrastructure, facilities and personnel will be adequate to support our future operations or to effectively adapt to future growth.

Moreover, to the extent we subsequently increase our level of participation in any of these joint ventures, business alliances or consortia, we may be required to pay deferred consideration. In connection with joint ventures, business alliances or consortia, we typically enter into partnerships or other forms of shareholder agreements that may restrict our ability to control or direct the actions of such joint ventures, business alliances or consortia. Any arrangement in which we do not fully control business operations has in the past presented, and may in the future present, greater financial, legal, operational and/or compliance risks.

Our effective tax rate is subject to fluctuation from one period to the next because the income tax rates for each year are a function of many factors, including: (i) taxable income levels and the effects of a mix of profits (losses) earned by the Company in numerous tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates; (ii) our ability to utilize deferred tax assets; (iii) taxes, refunds, interest or penalties resulting from tax audits; (iv) the magnitude of various credits and deductions as a percentage of total taxable income; and (v) changes in tax laws, the interpretation of such tax laws or changes to national corporate income tax rates, including with respect to interest deductibility on intragroup loans. Changes in the mix of these items may cause our effective tax rate to fluctuate between periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Tax structuring within international groups has increasingly become a corporate social responsibility issue and there is currently strong political pressure to change the international tax environment. In 2015, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (the “OECD”) released various reports under its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) action plan to reform international tax systems and prevent tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning. These actions aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including cross-border taxes, transfer-pricing documentation rules and nexus-based tax incentive practices. The reports have a very broad scope including, but not limited to, neutralizing the effects of hybrid mismatch arrangements, limiting base erosion involving interest deductions and other financial payments, countering harmful tax practices, preventing the granting of treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances and imposing mandatory disclosure rules. It is the responsibility of OECD members to consider how the BEPS recommendations should be reflected in their national legislation. In light of the BEPS action plan, launched by the OECD and supported by the EU, and its rapid development, there are indications that there is support for global tax coordination among jurisdictions which could have a significant impact on the international taxation landscape in which we operate.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

The business, including the implementation of transactions between entities within the Group, is conducted in accordance with our interpretation and understanding of current tax legislation, tax treaties and other provisions, case law and claims from tax authorities. However, there is a risk that our interpretation and application of tax rules, treaties and other regulations and requirements have not been or will not continue to be completely accurate in all respects. There is also a risk that the tax authorities in the countries concerned will issue decisions that deviate from our interpretation. Changes in tax law or practice could result in financial losses or increased expenses for the Company. 45 ----- In relation to corporate income tax, the Company, as a multinational group with several types of transactions occurring between legal entities in different jurisdictions, must comply with the OECD requirements regarding transfer pricing and transfer pricing documentation, as well as with new legislation being implemented as a result of the BEPS framework. BEPS refers to tax avoidance strategies that exploit gaps and mismatches in tax rules to artificially shift profits to low or no-tax locations. These rules may, in practice and under certain circumstances, result in double taxation of income or in costs being non-deductible. In relation to value-added tax (“VAT”), the application of, exemption from, or refund of VAT varies according to both the jurisdiction in which the service is being provided and the nature of the service itself. Financial services, including the portfolio investments component of the Company’s Portfolio Investments segment, are treated in many jurisdictions as tax-exempt or receive exceptional tax treatment. This may result in different interpretations regarding the possibility to recover input VAT charged to the Company by external and internal suppliers. The treatment of VAT claims included in receivables purchased from external parties also varies between the jurisdictions. For example, in the Netherlands, a VAT receivable may be included when purchasing overdue receivables. The VAT portion of the receivable can be recovered from the tax authorities if it is not collected from the customer. Similar regulations also apply for Norwegian VAT purposes. In Sweden, the Supreme Court issued a judgment in December 2016 regarding a claim against a private individual that had been acquired by a financial company. The claim had originally arisen through the sale of goods to a company that was subsequently declared bankrupt, and where the private individual liable for the claim had been a member of the board of directors. The Supreme Court held that the private individual was not liable for the portion of the claim relating to VAT, as the company that originally sold the goods had recovered the VAT from the Swedish Tax Agency. We are currently assessing the judgment to consider whether this could have any impact on our portfolio investments operations. Changes in fiscal regulations or the interpretation of tax laws, and any consequent VAT payments, particularly given that a systematic error could cause a rapid build-up of large amounts, may have a material adverse effect on our business.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

In Norway specifically, under the new rules introduced with effect on January 1, 2019, interest deductions on all loans are limited to 25% of a specifically defined profit (“taxable EBITDA”) for companies with tax liability to Norway that are deemed part of a group. The right to deduct interest is, however, not limited if the total net interest costs of the group companies with tax liability to Norway (independently or combined) are NOK 25 million or lower. The borrower may nevertheless maintain a right to deduct all interest expenses if the equity ratio of the Norwegian borrower or alternatively the average of all Norwegian entities in the group 46 ----- (provided that they deliver a consolidated balance that includes all group companies subject to Norwegian taxes), is equal to or higher than the equity ratio for the group globally (subject to a safety margin). The calculation of the equity ratio is based on the situation at the year-end prior to the income year, i.e. the equity ratio for 2020 is based on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2019. For companies that are not deemed part of a group, limitation on interest deduction rules may apply with regard to loans granted from certain related parties if the net interest paid on such a loan exceeds NOK 5 million. Under the interest limitation rules, the intercompany lender (if taxable in Norway) will be taxed for its interest income even though the borrower’s right to deduct interest costs will be limited under the rule. The interest limitation rules also contain provisions under which external loans may in this respect in certain situations be regarded as internal loans. For example, where a parent company has provided a guarantee for its subsidiary’s debt. The subsidiary’s external loan will then be reclassified as an internal loan subject to the rules concerning limitations on interest deductions. Our loans to applicable Norwegian subsidiaries are limited and interest limitation rules therefore have a limited impact on our current structure. The Norwegian Ministry of Finance issued a consultation paper regarding the introduction of new rules relating to withholding tax on interests and royalties on February 27, 2020. Pursuant to the proposal presented in the consultation paper, interests and royalties that are paid from an entity with full or limited tax liability to Norway to a recipient that is a tax resident outside of Norway, shall be subject to 15% withholding tax to the extent the recipient is a related party to the payor. A 50% ownership would be sufficient to constitute a related party relationship in this respect. Additionally, for this withholding tax to apply, the recipient must be a tax resident in a low-tax jurisdiction, which is defined as a jurisdiction that has an effective tax rate that is less than two thirds of the effective Norwegian tax rate on similar income. Recipients that are genuinely established within the European Economic Area and conduct real economic activity there may elect an alternative net taxation method, implying that instead of withholding tax on the gross amount interest received, corporate income tax (currently at a rate of 22%) may be applied on the basis of the received amount less deduction of costs borne by the recipient which are directly associated with the current loan arrangement. The new rules are proposed to come into effect from January 1, 2021. Many tax treaties limit Norway’s ability to impose withholding tax on interest. A withholding tax will however, if implemented, take full effect in relation to states which Norway does not have a tax treaty.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

Deductible interest after the application of the aforementioned limitations will be referred hereto as the “Maximum Deductible Amount.” The apportionment of non-deducted interest in a given fiscal year, may be deducted in the following fiscal years, subject to the Maximum Deductible Amount in each subsequent fiscal year. If the amount of net financial expenses in a given fiscal year is below the Maximum Deductible Amount, the difference between the net financial expenses deducted in that year and the Maximum Deductible Amount may increase such Maximum Deductible Amount in the immediate subsequent five years. We have financed several acquisitions of companies and portfolios in Spain with internal group loans. In these situations the debt capacity is always considered and non-deductible interests costs from one year are typically carried forward and used in later years, if applicable. The impact of the above rules on our ability to deduct interest paid on indebtedness could increase our tax burden and therefore negatively impact our cash-flows, financial condition and operating results and, potentially, our ability to serve our indebtedness. 47 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

The performance of our portfolios is tested regularly. Any revaluation is charged through the profit and loss account as an adjustment to revenues. Accordingly, the value of our purchased portfolios as recorded on our statement of financial position and our revenues in our income statement may fluctuate each time we reassess forecasted cash flows. Our forecasted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions. Forecasts are generated by applying historically observed decay rates to the actual gross collections achieved in recent months and also accounting for macroeconomic conditions and operational improvements, among other things. These historically observed decay rates are linked to the underlying collection fundamentals applicable at the time, including, among others, general economic conditions, the collections strategy, collections legislation and customer behavior. Any changes to these assumptions could result in revaluations which change the value of the portfolios on our consolidated statement of financial position and lead to the inclusion of a revaluation in our consolidated profit and loss account. While revaluations are non-cash movements, they are derived from the actual collections achieved in each individual portfolio and so affect revenue and cost of sales as a percentage of revenue. This subsequently impacts other profit and loss account line items, including gross profit, operating profit and the amount of tax on ordinary activities and can also impact our cash outflows for tax payments. There is generally a gap between the point in time when we purchase a portfolio and the point in time when we begin earning returns on the purchased portfolio as we do not always have control over when an agreement to purchase a portfolio will come into force and we need to then locate customers, build a consolidated profile of each such customer’s circumstances and formulate an appropriate repayment solution before we can start to collect on a purchased portfolio. As a result, we may experience uneven cash flows and delays in generating income from purchased portfolios. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

Various economic trends and potential changes to existing legislation, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or general efforts to harmonize insolvency regimes across the EU and including in the United Kingdom as a result of the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Bill, may contribute to an increase in the number of consumers subject to personal insolvency procedures. Under some insolvency procedures, a person’s assets may be sold to repay creditors. While we have recently increased our focus on secured NPLs so that we may be in a position to collect on such portfolios under insolvency procedures, the majority of portfolios that we service are unsecured which means that we are generally unable to collect on such portfolios under insolvency procedures involving the sale of a person’s assets.

Where we are unable to produce account documents in response to a customer’s request, that account would be legally unenforceable. Furthermore, if any of the account documents we do have were found to be legally 48 ----- unenforceable, courts may deny our claims. Any changes to laws, regulations or rules that affect the manner in which we initiate enforcement proceedings, including rules affecting documentation, could result in increased administration costs or limit the availability of litigation as a collection tool, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Additionally, our ability to collect by means other than legal proceedings may be impacted by laws that require that certain types of account documentation be in our possession prior to the institution of any collection activities. In the normal course of our debt portfolio purchases, and in the management of any forward flow agreements that we may enter into from time to time, some individual accounts may be included in the portfolios that fail to conform to the terms of the purchase contracts, or the legal existence of the debt may be in doubt due to lack of documentation either at the time the debt was incurred or at discharge. Accounts that would be eligible for recourse if discovered in a timely fashion, but that we do not discover in time for such recourse, are likely to yield no return. If we purchase debt portfolios containing a sufficient number of accounts that do not conform to the terms of the purchase contracts or containing a sufficient number of accounts that are otherwise uncontrollable or unenforceable, we may be unable to recover an amount sufficient to make the portfolio purchase profitable or to recover anything at all.

We may also face delays or difficulties in implementing process and system improvements, which could adversely affect our ability to successfully compete in the markets we serve. In addition, the costs associated with implementing such plans may exceed anticipated amounts and we may not have sufficient financial resources to fund all of the desired or necessary investments required in connection with our plans, including one-time costs associated with our business consolidation and operating improvement plans. These factors could prevent us or delay the achievement of our financial targets, including any deleveraging. As part of our growth strategy, we seek acquisition opportunities and invest significant resources in making acquisition bids, which we may not win, or in entering into partnership agreements. Even if we do enter into binding acquisition or partnership agreements, the consummation of such acquisition or partnership agreements may be subject to various conditions, including regulatory approvals, which may not be achieved. We may not recover allocated resources, costs or expenses associated with failed bids, which could adversely impact our liquidity and cash flows. The existing and future execution of our strategic and operating plans will, to some extent, also be dependent on external factors that we cannot control such as legislative changes, systemic failures in our industry or the industry sectors of our clients and changes in fiscal and monetary policies.

Although we believe that our risk management procedures are adequate, many of our methods of managing risk and exposures are based upon observed historical market behavior and statistic-based historical models. As a result, these methods may not accurately predict future exposures, which could be significantly greater than historical measures indicate. Other risk management methods depend on the evaluation of information regarding markets, debt originators, debt collection agencies, customers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible to us. In certain countries, we rely on intermediaries such as debt collection agencies and we may be held liable for the acts of intermediaries if we cannot demonstrate that we have adequate procedures in place to prevent risks such as bribery. For example, debt originators typically require us to assume responsibility for the acts of their respective third-party intermediaries in relation to ongoing compliance matters. Further, we track employee misconduct and have policies and procedures in place to minimize its impact, but these procedures may not prove sufficient to prevent, for example, employee fraud among other adverse impacts. Failure to develop, implement, monitor and, when necessary, preemptively upgrade our risk management policies and procedures, or the perceived failure of any of the above, could give rise to reputational issues for both us and any associated debt originators and may result in breaches of contractual obligations for which we may incur substantial losses and face removal from debt originators’ purchasing panels.

Some of the debt we may incur in the future could be structurally senior to the Notes or may be secured by collateral that does not secure the Notes. In addition, the Indenture will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute debt under those agreements. The incurrence of additional debt would increase the leverage-related risks described in this Offering Memorandum. Moreover, subject to compliance with the restrictive debt covenant in the indenture, we may issue an unlimited amount of additional notes under the Indenture, including additional notes constituting a different series from the Notes.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event that the Existing MTNs and certain Eligible MTN Replacement Indebtedness shall have been repaid in full, then, subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer will be required to cause certain of its subsidiaries that guarantee indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to guarantee the Notes; however, this covenant will be subject to a number of exceptions and limitations including, amongst others, if there are any existing contractual obligations that prohibit such guarantees. The 2023 Private Placement Notes and the Existing Commercial Paper Program currently prohibit the provision of such guarantees and therefore the Issuer will not be under an obligation to cause any of its subsidiaries to guarantee the Notes until such indebtedness is refinanced and such refinancing indebtedness does not include a similar restriction. Further, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides that if the Existing MTNs and Eligible MTN Replacement Indebtedness shall have been repaid in full, then all of the guarantees provided under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (other than by the Issuer) will be terminated, making it even more unlikely that the Notes will benefit from any subsidiary guarantee in the future. As a result, there can be no assurance that such subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes in a timely manner after any such repayment, or at all, and you should not rely on such potential guarantees as a basis of your investment decision. In the event any subsidiaries of the Issuer guarantee the Notes in the future, such guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant guarantor, without rendering the relevant guarantee voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable law or without resulting in a breach of any applicable law, and enforcement of each guarantee would be subject to certain generally available defenses. These laws and defenses include those that relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally.

Subject to certain limitations, if there is a payment default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility, senior debt documents or the Indenture, or if a senior payment stop notice is issued following a non-payment event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility, senior debt documents or the Indenture, then payments under the Notes will not be permitted to be made unless the payment is funded directly or indirectly with amounts which have not been received from the Issuer or its restricted subsidiaries. In some circumstances, for instance where payments were received on the Notes in breach of the Intercreditor Agreement, holders would be required to turn over such payments to the Security Agent for redistribution. In addition, although the holders of the Notes are generally entitled to enforce their claims against the Issuer pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, nevertheless the Intercreditor Agreement places limits on enforcement to the extent it would prejudice the enforcement by senior creditors of their security granted by the Issuer.

In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in Sweden or another relevant jurisdiction. The bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of Sweden may be materially different from, or in conflict with, those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain 55 ----- post-petition interest and duration of the proceeding. The application of Swedish laws or laws of another relevant jurisdiction, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes in those jurisdictions, limit any amounts that you may receive or otherwise result in a less favorable outcome.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Existing Notes Indentures, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in an event of default under, acceleration of, or an obligation to mandatorily prepay the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow them to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of control, may be limited by our then existing financial resources. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from repurchasing the Notes by the terms of its indebtedness (or the Issuer’s subsidiaries are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes), we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained or such refinancing is not possible, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Existing Notes Indentures and certain other indebtedness.

Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of control,” the Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction. The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the Issuer’s and its restricted subsidiaries’ assets taken as a whole.

The common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the global notes representing the applicable Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the relevant global notes representing the Notes will be made to Citibank, N.A., London Branch as principal paying agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold bookentry interests in the global notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment by the Principal Paying Agent to Euroclear and Clearstream, we will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest in the Notes, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream or, if you are not a participant in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the relevant Notes under the Indenture. Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have any direct rights to act upon any solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear or Clearstream, or, if applicable, from a participant. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any matters or on a timely basis. Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until the relevant definitive registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. We cannot assure you that the procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you as a holder of the Notes regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all. 57 ----- An application has been made for Notes to be listed on the Securities Official List of the Exchange, though we cannot assure you that Notes will remain listed. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the Notes being listed on the Securities Official List of the Exchange, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting, whether or not for an alternative admission to listing on another stock exchange, of the Notes from the Exchange may have a material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes in the secondary market.

If investors measure their investment returns by reference to a currency other than euro an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the values of the currency of the applicable Notes relative to the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments because of economic, political and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the currency of the applicable Notes against the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which the investors measure the return on their investments.

The directors, managers and/or executive officers of the Issuer are non-residents of the United States and substantially all of their assets are located outside the United States. Although the Issuer will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on these directors, managers and executive officers. In addition, as substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against them. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer may not be subject to the provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with Sweden. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability in Sweden of U.S. securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in such jurisdictions. In addition, the enforcement in Sweden of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions. There is also doubt that a court in Sweden would have the requisite power or authority to grant remedies sought in an original action brought in such jurisdictions on the basis of U.S. securities laws violations.

We provide clients with a complete value proposition across the entire CMS value chain, built on our longstanding commitment to fair and ethical collection. We leverage our economies of scale, digitization and large information databases to increase efficiency while also driving growth through strategic transactions. Strategic transactions in recent periods include the Piraeus Partnership, completed in October 2019, in which we acquired 80% of the bank’s service platform for managing overdue receivables and, by leveraging our collections expertise and working in partnership with Piraeus Bank, we have created the first independent leading credit management platform in Greece. In April 2018, we entered into the Intesa Partnership, which established us in 67 ----- 2018 as a leading player in late payments in Italy, one of Europe’s most attractive late payments markets. In December 2018 we purchased a real estate portfolio from Ibercaja, which we hold with a co-investor, and in April 2019 we completed the acquisition of Solvia, which cemented our leading position in Spain in servicing loans and providing RES.

In addition to, and generally in combination with, collection services, we provide capabilities in alternative solutions and offer clients a wide range of value-added services prior to loans and receivables becoming overdue. Our value-added service offering includes credit information and analysis on individuals and companies to help our clients assess their potential customers’ payment capacity, data extraction and modelling, selection and scoring of potential customers, our RES offering and a full suite of services relating to accounts receivable, including invoicing, reminders and account ledger services. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, our Credit Management Services segment generated revenue of SEK 4,559 million (€428 million equivalent), excluding revenue generated from portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables that we own. - **_Strategic Markets segment. As of January 1, 2020, we simplified our organizational structure, transitioning away from two service lines that focused on four geographic regions and establishing Strategic Markets as our third segment alongside our Credit Management Services segment and Portfolio Investments segment. The establishment of the Strategic Markets segment reflects our strategic growth in recent years. Our Strategic Markets segment focuses on providing CMS in our Brazilian, Greek, Italian and Spanish operations, with the Greek, Italian and Spanish markets in particular being large and important markets in which we have similar operations based on partnerships with major financial institutions, including our Piraeus Partnership in Greece and our Intesa Partnership in Italy. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, our Strategic Markets segment generated revenue of SEK 4,819 million (€452 million equivalent), excluding revenue generated from portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables that we own. - **_Portfolio Investments segment. Through our Portfolio Investments segment, we offer a range of portfolio investment financial services, including our REO offering. Our portfolio investment financial services focuses on the purchase portfolios of secured and unsecured loans and other overdue receivables from our clients for a portion of their nominal value, which we generally then service using our in-house debt collection function. Upon purchase of defaulted receivables, we put in place long-term debt collection measures aimed at helping customers become debt-free as we work together to reduce their debt. In line with our core values, which are based on an empathetic and ethical approach to helping indebted customers become debt free in a respectful manner, we interact with every customer to craft solutions on the basis of their individual circumstances, for example through instalment plans that take account of each consumer’s payment capacity. As part of our Portfolio Investments segment, we also provide factoring, payment guarantees and e-commerce services. Our Portfolio Investments segment also houses our REO offering (including our REO 68 ----- offering in Brazil, Greece, Italy and Spain), which includes, either in the course of recovery activities for secured loans (or, infrequently, in relation to unsecured loans with personal guarantees) or as a standalone investment strategy, directly or indirectly and independently or alongside co-investors, holding title to real estate that we expect to eventually resell. We arrange for the sale of such real estate using internal and external resources and networks. Our real estate exposure within our Portfolio Investment segment is concentrated in Italy, Hungary, Portugal and Spain. Properties are either wholly owned or held by joint ventures in which we participate along with our co-investors. Our properties, including both wholly owned properties and properties held by joint ventures in which we participate along with our co-investors, total to approximately 5,816 properties. The book value of real estate assets in our consolidated balance sheet together with our joint ventures' book value related to properties as of June 30, 2020 was SEK 765 million. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, we generated revenue of SEK 6,297 million (€591 million equivalent) from our Portfolio Investments segment. As of June 30, 2020, the ERC of our portfolios of loans and overdue receivables was SEK 64,674 million (€6,162 million equivalent). We believe that the combination of our debt collection services, portfolio investments expertise and strategic financial institution partnerships has been and will continue to be key to our success. Our complete range of services helps attract and retain clients and increases the breadth and depth of collectible data, in turn supporting the creation of tailored collection strategies and development of analytical capabilities to more accurately price portfolios. Operating across Europe with an integrated and balanced business model also gives us investment optionality as we can allocate resources across our platform and jurisdictions to pursue the opportunities that we find most attractive. Our breadth of service and geographic diversification also increases our resilience to economic disruptions (such as that caused by the COVID-19 pandemic). The diversified nature of our business allows us to effectively mitigate some of the resulting negative impact.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521
151,Final Offerings 2020.md,899,MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,899.2,Significant factors affecting results of operations,899.2.1,Volume of clients outsourcing their credit optimization and collection requirements and the level of debt available for purchase,"Providing an integrated service offering throughout the CMS chain is key to attracting and retaining clients. We believe that onboarding clients at the outset of their transaction processes by providing them with credit optimization and collection services has been crucial to our success. Our results of operations are linked to the volume of companies seeking to outsource their credit-related offerings and to the overall level of loans and other overdue receivables available for purchase and third-party collection in the markets and industry sectors in which we operate. During the periods under review, the volume of credit management services that we have provided and the volume of loans and other overdue receivables available for purchase has generally increased. We believe that this trend will continue due to three main factors: (i) an increasing consumer expectation that businesses will offer alternatives to direct, one-off payments and as a result an increasing number of businesses seeking to offer alternative payment methods in order to remain competitive in their respective markets; (ii) businesses increasingly choosing to sell NPLs and other overdue receivables as a result of regulatory pressure to deleverage and businesses’ desire for improved and predictable cash flows; and (iii) an increase in the number of businesses outsourcing credit optimization and collection services or selling overdue receivables in order to focus on their core operations, creating a growing sophistication gap in debt collection capabilities when compared to credit management providers. During the periods under review, we benefited from these trends and were able to expand operations and improve our results of operations. In the first half of 2020, primarily as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have observed a short-term reduction in the supply of new NPL portfolios that we believe is the result of elevated uncertainty on pricing and quality and the provision of temporary reliefs on balance sheet management which may have made financial institutions less likely to sell their non-performing exposures. Ultimately, however, the evolution of NPL stock depends on the macroeconomic situations of the countries in question. For example, in a favorable macroeconomic environment, NPL generation is more muted, 69 ----- as evidenced by NPL levels over the last few years. In a downturn, such as is currently being experienced on a global level in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we would expect eventually to see an increase in the generation of new NPLs. For further discussion of key NPL supply drivers, see “Industry Overview—Key Drivers of the _Credit Management Industry.” Separately, moratoriums on certain debt related legal proceedings, which have_ been introduced in some of the jurisdictions in which we operate have caused temporary delay in the business volumes that we service on behalf of clients. COVID-19-related reduced activity in the legal systems in certain jurisdictions has also resulted in collections and cash flow delays in our operations in certain countries.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521
151,Final Offerings 2020.md,899,MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,899.2,Significant factors affecting results of operations,899.2.2,Making portfolio investments at the right price,"Our ability to purchase portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables at the right price has been and will continue to be a key driver of our results of operations. Our portfolio investments consist primarily of portfolios of loans, real estate portfolios and other overdue receivables purchased at prices significantly below the nominal total collectible value on the portfolios and recognized at amortized cost. We expect to achieve collections in excess of the portfolio purchase price. As of June 30, 2020 our ERC was 1.85 times the book value of our portfolio investments and our book value of portfolio investments together with the book value of our joint ventures and real estate assets, but not including co-investor book value, was SEK 35 billion. When purchasing portfolios, we engage in an extensive valuation of the portfolio in order to determine the optimal price to offer the client. See “Business—Operations and service offerings—Portfolio Investments _segment—Purchase of overdue receivables.” Our investment criteria for real estate portfolios differs from our_ investment criteria for our loan and overdue receivables portfolios due to the unique aspects of the real estate market, including valuations of the underlying assets and collateral, our risk exposure to price and value fluctuations in applicable real estate markets and the unique legislative and enforcement regimes applicable to real property. Our performance is dependent on our ability to purchase portfolios of loans, real estate portfolios and other overdue receivables that meet our investment criteria and that generate an appropriate return on our portfolio investments. After purchasing a portfolio, our performance is further dependent on our ability to generate gross collection levels at or in excess of expectations for the specific portfolio. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our average collection of forecast was 108%, 112% and 109%, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, our average collection of forecast was 107% and 107%, respectively. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, our average collection of forecast was 108% and 108%, respectively. During the periods under review, we also expanded the scope of our investments within new asset classes, primarily in secured claims and REOs. In December 2018, we reached an agreement to purchase 6,400 REOs in Spain from Ibercaja Banco SA, holding the REOs in a new company of which we were initially an 80% shareholder and from which in the first quarter of 2019 we divested half of our shares in the holding company to a co-investor. In the second quarter of 2019, we also acquired Solvia, which offers real estate management services in the Spanish market, and, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we acquired our interest in Intrum Hellas REO Solutions SA, which, among other services, offers real estate management services in the Greek market. Secured claims entail additional complexity with respect to pricing and forecasting due to different risk and collection profiles when compared to the unsecured loans and receivables that have historically been our main focus. As of June 30, 2020, 7% of the book value of our portfolio investments (excluding joint ventures and real estate) consisted of secured loans. In 2008 and 2009, the global financial crisis reduced the propensity of debt originators to sell overdue receivables as prices decreased and also made it more difficult for debt purchasers to obtain funding for portfolio investments. During this period, collection levels on certain portfolios decreased in some countries thereby reducing overall portfolio performance. This impacted not only the pricing of new portfolios, but also the valuation of existing portfolios. We were partly shielded from these challenging market conditions due to our integrated offering, in particular our debt collection services. Our full-service business model allowed us to adapt our business mix and meet client demands. In contrast, pure debt purchasers that lacked in-house debt collection operations were unable to adapt in this manner. Similarly, when the global market started to recover in 2010 and pricing levels became increasingly attractive for sellers, we were able to respond rapidly by increasing our portfolio purchases. We believe that our integrated business model allows us to adapt to changing market environments and to fluctuations in supply and demand across our client offering. During the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, we invested SEK 7,528 million in the purchase of portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables, including deliveries under forward flow agreements, with an aggregate total collectible value of SEK 77,625 million. As of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2020, we had ERC of SEK 64,995 million and SEK 64,674 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2020, 70 ----- the portfolio investments book value in our consolidated statement of financial position, together with the book value of our joint ventures and real estate assets, but not including co-investor book value, was SEK 35,429 million and SEK 34,945 million, respectively. The majority of portfolios for sale are offered to the market through competitive tender processes. There are two principal models for purchasing portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables: (i) one-off agreements and (ii) forward flow agreements. In a one-off agreement, we purchase a portfolio of claims in a single standalone transaction. In a forward flow agreement, we buy claims from a client on an ongoing basis at a pre-defined price or price range for a given volume and quality. We typically enter into forward flow agreements with partners with whom we have established relationships, which gives us confidence around quality and volume, and based on past experience we expect that many of these contracts will be renewed. Forward flow agreements are beneficial to our business because they offer a predictable and certain flow of claims though they are typically not long-term contracts and so do not provide long-term assurance on purchasing levels. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we invested SEK 1,369 million and SEK 1,736 million, respectively, in forward flow agreements and for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, we invested SEK 852 million and SEK 772 million, respectively, in forward flow agreements. Our ability to make portfolio investments is dependent on our internally generated funding resources and access to adequate and attractive financing at the time portfolios become available for purchase. We currently fund purchases of portfolios, working capital needs and other expenditures with cash generated from operating activities, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility or additional bank or capital markets debt. In certain cases, we also partner with co-investors to purchase portfolios, which reduces our funding requirements proportionately to our economic interest in the given portfolios and, in some cases, adds additional off-balance sheet leverage. Revenue and earnings derived from co-investments are recognized based on proportionate participations in co-investment structures. See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Off balance sheet _arrangements.” We believe that we will continue to be able to generate funding resources and obtain financing_ subject to market conditions. See “—Liquidity and capital resources” for additional information on funding of our portfolio purchases and “—Significant factors affecting results of operations—Economic conditions” for additional information on the effects of economic conditions on our business and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521
151,Final Offerings 2020.md,899,MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,899.2,Significant factors affecting results of operations,899.2.3,Competition and pricing,"Competition and pricing levels in the markets in which we operate affect our ability to successfully and profitably offer credit optimization, payment, collection and financial services. The European credit management market is fragmented and consists of several thousand companies with varied profiles. The pricing element of portfolio investment and debt collection services is highly competitive across all markets, resulting in increased pricing levels for purchases and decreased pricing levels for the provision of debt collection services during the periods under review. We believe that in recent years there has been a trend towards increased concentration of the credit management industry with large, incumbent credit management companies expanding in scale as core clients, in particular financial institutions, have placed increasing value on high-quality data assets acquired over an extended period of time, robust compliance frameworks, multinational presence and long-term relationships with credit management companies. In addition, reputation and ethical behavior are important competitive advantages in order to maintain relationships with current and potential clients, particularly financial institutions. The 2008 global financial crisis led to unattractive pricing levels for purchases of portfolios in 2008 and 2009, primarily as a result of the reduced ability of customers to repay their debt, lower supply as debt originators became reluctant to sell overdue receivables at the lower valuations and difficulties in obtaining financing for the purchase of portfolios. Pricing levels have generally become more advantageous during the periods under review. Unlike competitors that may not offer debt collection services, our integrated and balanced operations provide an efficient tool in competitive landscapes. We are able to generate steady revenue and cash flow from our credit optimization, payment and collection services and as a result we can be selective about which portfolios we bid for as we do not need to purchase portfolios that do not offer an attractive risk adjusted return simply to ensure sufficient cash flow for our operations. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to our industry and business—We are _active in competitive markets and may be unable to continue to successfully compete with businesses that may offer more attractive prices or benefit from less expensive funding or pursue lower return requirements than us.”_",N/A,as_expected,2020,521
151,Final Offerings 2020.md,899,MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,899.2,Significant factors affecting results of operations,899.2.4,Gross collection levels,"We have a large and diverse collection of portfolios that have delivered consistent and stable revenue over time. We primarily generate revenue from: (i) fees received for credit information and payment services; (ii) fees and commissions received from claims on which we perform debt collection services pursuant to contracts that 71 ----- typically contain “no cure no pay” payment terms (meaning that we are paid only if we are able to successfully collect on a claim); and (iii) payments received from customers linked to claims in our portfolio investments. The ability and willingness of a customer to pay depends on several factors, including employment status, the availability of funds and asset ownership. We believe that our business benefits from both the quality of the data that we build about a customer’s circumstances as well as the analysis we are able to perform on customer data to assess ability and willingness to pay and, ultimately, to determine the best collections strategy for each customer. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, downward pressure on gross collection has been partially offset by the high level of online and automated payments available across our network. In the year ended December 31, 2019, 85% of our total collections for our own portfolios came from automated or online channel. Additionally, in the six months ended June 30, 2020, more than 80% of the collected amounts on our loan portfolios were generated from automated and online payments. _Gross collection levels in our Credit Management Services segment and Strategic Markets segment_ The volume of loans and other overdue receivables that clients outsource to us and, consequently, our revenue from debt collection services, is linked to our relationships with our debt collection clients and our ability to demonstrate strong gross collection levels. Different types of asset classes and different jurisdictions have different collection profiles and contract types. We offer flexible pricing arrangements to our debt collection clients that are tailored to the client’s specific circumstances and business needs as well as to the relevant claims. The strength of our Credit Management Services segment and Strategic Markets segment pricing and claims collection capabilities is evidenced by the master servicing agreements pursuant to which we provide collection services on client loans and other overdue receivables. We believe that the benefits of our claims collection strategy are evident through our many long-standing client relationships in which we are seen as a trusted, important and strategic business partner. For more information about our debt collection services, see “—Key _operating metrics for Credit Management Services segment and Strategic Markets segment.” Gross collection levels on portfolio investments_ We purchase debt portfolios at significant discount to the total collectible value on portfolio investments and typically collect multiples of the purchase price. After we purchase a portfolio, we typically manage collection on that portfolio in-house. Revenue generated from claims in our purchased portfolios is directly impacted by the gross collection levels that we are able to achieve. As we keep all funds collected on purchased portfolios, we are able to strategically allocate additional resources and costs to optimize collection and increase collection levels on a given portfolio until it reaches the stage when the resources and costs required exceed expected revenue, at which stage we assign the portfolio to our debt surveillance department. We believe that our ability to convert non-paying claims into paying claims illustrates the high degree of accuracy of our data assets and analytic capabilities and the effectiveness of our scalable, multi-channel collections approach. We further believe that we operate our forecasts with an appropriate balance between prudent pricing and strong collection performance. From January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2020, on a quarterly basis we collected 103% – 115% of our cash flow forecasts. For a description of how we manage and track the performance of our portfolios, see “—Revaluation of _portfolio investments.” Collection costs and operational efficiency_ Optimizing customer contact at each stage of the collection life cycle is key to our debt collection strategy and success. Much of our debt collection process is standardized and automated in order to maximize the total amount collected over the life of the debt through sustainable payment plans or affordable settlements achieved through an amicable and solution-oriented collection approach rather than exploiting short-term collection potential. In our Portfolio Investments segment, we benefit from additional revenue resulting from additional resources allocated to the collection on a portfolio. In our Credit Management Services segment and Strategic Markets segment, our clients may need to agree to our receiving a higher commission in order for us to allocate additional resources to the collection. Debt purchasing does not require the client to take this risk, but the client can realize some of the benefit by receiving an attractive price level.

Measured by purchase price, we have generally purchased more portfolios in the fourth quarter when debt originators in general, and financial institutions in particular, often seek to sell assets. In the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, 52%, 46% and 39%, respectively, of the portfolios that we purchased were purchased in the fourth quarter. However, there may be exceptions to this trend. Our interim results may also be impacted by the timing of the closing of a specific portfolio purchase and/or seasonal factors, such as whether Easter occurs in the first or second quarter of the year. The seasonality described above impacts the returns generated through debt collections on our purchased portfolios, and the amortization of such portfolios, and are recognized in our consolidated income statement as described in more detail in “—Recognition _of purchased portfolios, revenue recognition, estimation of cash flow forecasts and revaluation of purchased portfolios.”_ Our debt collection is also affected by seasonal factors relating to customers, including the number of work days in a given month, the propensity of customers to take holidays at particular times of the year and annual cycles in disposable income. Collections within specific portfolios may have high seasonal variances while our costs are more evenly spread out over the year, which may result in high variances of margins and profitability between quarters. Our servicing margins are generally lower in the first quarter, whereas collections are generally higher in the second and fourth quarters, also due to customers’ receipt of tax refunds, holiday bonus payments and other factors.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

We have been able to successfully integrate new businesses into our existing operations, achieve strategic plans, capitalize on synergies and leverage our strong client relationships to acquire assets from some of the largest telecommunications, utilities, banking and retail companies in Europe. These acquisitions have allowed us to enhance our business intelligence capabilities, collection related local knowledge and generate steady streams of revenue. From January 1, 2017 to June 30, 2020, our significant acquisitions include: - In October 2019, as part of the Piraeus Partnership, we acquired 80% of Piraeus Bank’s Recovery Banking Unit in combination with a long-term non-performing exposures servicing agreement. Piraeus Bank owns the remaining 20% of the partnership company. The purchase price corresponding to the acquisition of 80% of the shares in the partnership company was €328 million, of which €296 million was paid in cash on closing of the transaction with the remainder planned after year end 2022. - In April 2019, we acquired 80% of Banco Sabadell’s wholly owned subsidiary Solvia Servicios Inmobilarios, which offers real estate management services in the Spanish market, for a purchase price of €241 million, with approximately €190 million paid upon closing and the remainder planned to be paid in 2022. The consideration paid in cash upon closing was accounted for at SEK 1,937 million at the acquisition date. - In December 2018, we entered into the Intesa Partnership with Intesa, pursuant to which Intesa contributed its service platform for overdue receivables, consisting of a collection department with a labor force of 600, and we contributed all of our Italian operations at the time other than Cross Factor SpA and the holding company Lindorff Italy Srl. As a result of the partnership agreement, we own a 51% interest in the shared Italian collection business, Intrum Italy SpA (“Intrum Italy”), and therefore consolidate its results of operations, with the minority share attributable to Intesa reported as a non-controlling interest. Intrum Italy also entered into a 10-year exclusive servicing agreement with Intesa for the vast majority of Intesa’s new NPL inflow during this period. As part of the partnership agreement, Intesa contributed a portfolio of overdue receivables consisting primarily of covered loans to Penelope SPV S.R.L (“Penelope”), a jointly-owned platform. Along with CarVal Investors, our co-investment partner, we own 51% of Penelope. We are subject to a shared controlling influence agreement with CarVal Investors, and therefore report our interest in the jointly owned platform as a participation in a joint venture. See “—Description of key _consolidated income statement line items—Participations in joint ventures—Ithaca Investment DAC.”_ - In December 2017, we acquired the Italian company CAF SpA (“CAF”), the third-largest credit management company for impaired unsecured receivables in Italy. In connection with the 75 ----- acquisition of CAF, we acquired from the sellers a large, diversified receivables portfolio of secured and unsecured consumer and SME debt, the collection on which is performed by CAF. The total purchase consideration for CAF and the portfolio was €200 million, on a cash and debt-free basis. - In June 2017, we completed the Merger to become the largest full-service European credit management company by revenue, EBITDA and ERC. For further discussion of the divestment of assets as required by the EC in connection with the Merger, see “—Divestments.” - In April 2017, we acquired Top Factoring, one of the leading portfolio investment companies in Romania. Top Factoring is primarily active in the bank and telecommunications sectors, with several strong customer relationships generating recurring investment opportunities in portfolio investments. The acquisition price was €25.7 million, the majority of which was attributed to a portfolio of overdue receivables held by Top Factoring SRL’s parent company. - In February 2017, we acquired 1st Credit Limited, a medium sized British company with operations in debt purchasing. The name of 1st Credit Limited was subsequently changed to Intrum UK Ltd. The purchase price on a cash and debt free basis was £130 million, attributable to a diversified portfolio of receivables deriving from investments from several sellers in the financial industry. _Divestments_ In March 2018, we completed the Divestment, which comprised the sale to the Lowell Group of Lindorff’s operations in Denmark, Estonia, Finland and Sweden as well as our historic operations in Norway. The Divestment was a condition for the EC’s approval of the Merger. The companies were sold for a purchase consideration of SEK 7,511 million. In connection with the Divestment, we entered into three-year brand licensing agreements with Lowell for the “Lindorff” brand in Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Estonia and the “Intrum Justitia” brand in Norway. In the consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2018 (including comparative information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017), the subsidiaries that were divested were reported as discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. See note 38 in the Issuer’s Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 and note 39 in the Issuer’s Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. In November 2017, we divested our shares in Arvada AB, formerly a joint venture between Intrum and TF Bank, to TF Bank. In October 2017, we sold the Dutch subsidiary Buckaroo BV to BlackFin Capital Partners.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521
151,Final Offerings 2020.md,899,MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,899.7,Portfolio Investments segment[(1)],899.7.3,Economic conditions,"The economic and market conditions in the countries in which we operate can have various effects on our operations. For example, adverse economic conditions and increased levels of unemployment may lead to higher default rates on claims, which may positively impact our ability to purchase portfolios with attractive returns by increasing the stock of portfolios available for purchase. Similarly, negative economic developments may increase the amount of loans and other overdue receivables held by our debt collection clients, which may increase the number of claims that clients want to outsource to us for collection. If adverse economic conditions materially reduce the ability of customers to enter into transactions or repay their debts, our revenue from credit optimization services, debt collection services and debt purchasing could decrease. Adverse economic conditions could also reduce some debt originators’ willingness to sell overdue receivables at prevailing market prices, which could decrease the overall volume of portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables available for us to purchase or could alternatively pressure some debt originators to sell portfolios in order to free up capital, which may increase the overall volume of loans and other overdue receivables available for us to purchase. Following the 2008 global financial crisis, for example, the industry experienced dramatic slowdowns in purchases of portfolios followed by increases in the sale of portfolios during subsequent periods as debt originators sought to free up capital. Unfavorable economic conditions may also impact our ability to obtain financing to purchase portfolios. The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant uncertainties and risk, adversely affecting economies on a global basis as well as on a specific basis in the markets in which we are active. Our business has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The spread of COVID-19 has impacted our segmental and regional operations in different ways, with Strategic Markets being the most adversely affected, Credit Management Services maintaining a flat operating margin and Portfolio Investments being impacted primarily as a result of 76 ----- extending our collection forecasts. Financial performance in the Strategic Markets segment for the three months ended June 30, 2020 improved significantly when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020 financial performance due in part to the reopening of the court systems in Greece, Italy and Spain in May as well as by our strict internal cost control measures. Overall, for the six months ended June 30, 2020 operating income and operating margin in our Strategic Markets segment decreased to SEK 447 million (€43 million equivalent) and 18% for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to SEK 575 million (€55 million equivalent) and 32% for the six months ended June 30, 2019. Decreases of the year were largely driven by government measures taken in Italy and Spain to limit the spread of COVID-19, including restrictions on movement, shop closures and, in particular, reduced activity in the legal systems, which resulted in collections and cash flow delays in our operations. Operating income and operating margin in our Credit Management Services segment decreased from SEK 803 million (€77 million equivalent) and 24% for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to SEK 844 million (€79 million equivalent) and 24% for the six months ended June 30, 2019. Financial Performance in our Credit Management Services segment declined in the three months ended June 30, 2020 when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020, in part due to lower business volume flows as some clients have temporarily eased payment terms for their customers. Operating income and operating margin in our Portfolio Investments segment were SEK 1,406 million (€134 million equivalent) and 52% for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to SEK 2,520 million (€239 million equivalent) and 72% for the six months ended June 30, 2019, with the decrease primarily due to underperformance in overdue receivables collections by our Italian SPV. We extended our collection forecasts in the three months ended March 31, 2020, pushing back our expected collection timing. However, overall collections in the three months ended June 30, 2020 exceeded these revised collection forecasts, with amounts collected in Greece, Italy and Spain slightly under the revised forecast and amounts collected in the remaining countries significantly above the revised forecast. In the three months ended June 30, 2020, we also experienced marginally higher earnings from joint ventures and underwriting return levels that were materially higher than levels prior to COVID-19. We also believe that our pipeline of debt collection cases remains at a good level and, additionally, that our broad geographical presence and wide variety of client solutions gives us a high degree of diversification, which, together with our underlying cash flow generation, helps to mitigate some of the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations. As a result of the COVID19 pandemic, as previously disclosed, we have also revised our business plan for 2020 and are reconsidering our short- and mid-term financial targets as we no longer consider that conditions are in place to meet our original goals for 2020. Our financial results during the first six months of 2020 were positively impacted the efficiency program implemented in 2019 but were also adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this negative impact, we continue to target a leverage ratio of 2.5-3.5x by year end 2022. See “Presentation of Financial Information—Financial Targets.”_ We have also decided to temporarily reduce our rate of investment and increase the yield requirements on new portfolio investments in order to increase cash flow in the business. The health and safety of our employees is of paramount importance. The majority of our employees have been working from home since mid-March, demonstrating the commitment of our workforce and our ability to manage our business volumes remotely. To ensure that our core values remain the foundation of our operations, we have also strengthened our internal guidelines to ensure we are interacting with customers uniquely affected by COVID19 on the basis of their individual circumstances and with an empathetic and ethical approach. In this way, we can continue to contribute to a financially sustainable balance between those who provide and receive credit, respectively. The ongoing economic downturn associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to have an adverse impact on business volumes and our ability to collect on claims which could also potentially impact our profitability. Improved economic conditions are likely to lower default rates on loans, which could negatively impact the growth of the stock of portfolios available for us to purchase. Improved economic conditions could also decrease the amount of loans and other overdue receivables held by our debt collection clients, which could negatively impact revenue generated through out debt collection services. Conversely, improved economic conditions and decreased levels of unemployment: (i) imply that consumers will have higher income and a corresponding increased ability to pay debt due on a timely basis, which could result in our experiencing lower costs to collect and (ii) are likely to drive higher consumption and encourage clients to offer deferred payment to customers which would likely improve demand for our credit optimization services. On January 31, 2020, the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU became effective and the United Kingdom entered into a transition period from January 31, 2020 to December 31, 2020 during which the EU will treat the United Kingdom as if it were still a member of the EU. If the United Kingdom and the EU are unable to negotiate an ongoing or a favorable agreement governing trade in goods and services, movement of individuals and political cooperation by the end of this period, both the general and economic conditions in the United Kingdom and the EU and the specific and individual economic circumstances of our clients and customers may be adversely affected to varying degrees. The withdrawal process has also created substantial political 77 ----- uncertainty within the EU and the United Kingdom, uncertainty in international financial markets and reduced economic growth. The resulting political and economic uncertainty could also lead to a departure, or heighten the risk of departure, from the Economic and Monetary Union of the EU by one or more Eurozone countries, the abandonment of the euro as a currency or the imposition of significant restrictions to, or the elimination of, barrierfree access amongst EU Member States or within the EEA overall. This heightened uncertainty, and the consequences of a withdrawal, in particular if an acceptable agreement is not arrived at, could have a significant negative effect on consumer and market confidence. In light of the exposure that we have to the EU and the euro through our euro-denominated borrowings, derivative instruments and cash flows, and to the United Kingdom and the British pound sterling given our Intrum UK Limited operations, any events adversely affecting the stability of the Eurozone or the United Kingdom or the euro or the British pound sterling could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The financial information as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 included in this Offering Memorandum is 73 ----- presented on the basis of the two service lines. From January 1, 2020, we have operated our business and presented our financial information on the basis of three operating segments: (i) the Credit Management Services segment, (ii) the Strategic Markets segment and (iii) the Portfolio Investments segment. Our financial information for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 is presented on the basis of our three segments. As a result of the change in segment reporting as described above, the results of operations on a service line basis for the years ended December 2019, 2018 and 2017 are not directly comparable to the results of operations on a segment basis for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information” for more information regarding the change in our operating and reporting segments. (2) Includes intergroup commissions. (3) Direct production costs and other operating costs to collect on the Portfolio Investments segment, the Credit Management Services segment and the Strategic Markets segment, respectively. For the Portfolio Investment segment, costs include the carrying value of disposed properties in the period. (4) Cost to collect based on segment costs relative to gross collections for the Portfolio Investments segment We have historically undertaken a range of initiatives that have improved our collections and margins and that we believe will continue to improve our resilience and long-term business performance. See “Summary— _Our Strengths.” Margins in our Credit Management Services segment remained stable in the first half of 2020 due_ to savings from the efficiency improvements program and tighter cost control, that offset lower revenues as a result of COVID-19. Temporarily, some countries experienced lower business volumes and easing of payment terms for their customers, adversely impacting revenues. Margins in our Strategic Markets segment decreased in the first half of 2020 due to COVID-19 significantly impacting southern Europe, which led to country-wide lockdowns and reduced activity in the legal systems for periods of time resulting in delays in cash flows. The savings from the efficiency improvements program and the Piraeus Partnership completed in October 2019 supported the margin. The collection cost ratios in our Portfolio Investments segment for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were 31% and 29%, respectively. The collection cost ratios in our Portfolio Investments segment for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 were 27% and 31%, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to tighter cost control and the temporary full consolidation of the REO portfolio acquired from Ibercaja in December 2018, during which the acquisition cost of real estate disposed of in the period was recognized in the service line cost for the six months ended June 30, 2019. Collection cost ratio is also impacted by the varying characteristics of the portfolios we purchase and the timing of portfolio purchases throughout the year. Specifically, we believe that trends in our collection cost ratio in the Portfolio Investments segment during the period under review have been primarily due to lower average blended ages of portfolios associated with large uptakes in portfolio investments. Costs are typically highest when portfolios are new as the higher initial collection costs exert upward pressure on costs to collect without immediate accompanying increases in gross collections. In addition, a large portion of recent portfolio purchases have come from financial institutions and have higher average collectible values, meaning that the total amount of cash collected per case increases even if the margin is slightly lower. The group EBIT-margin decreased from 33% in the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 to 7% in the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, positively impacted by the contribution from participation in JVs. Excluding such contribution, the EBIT-margin declined from 27% to 2%, negatively impacted by the impairment of goodwill, negative portfolio revaluations and the efficiency improvements program costs. Operational efficiency is key to our business model and a primary advantage of our business compared to competitors as well as financial institutions and other clients who handle their debt collection in-house. In the initial stages of the debt collection process, we estimate the creditworthiness of a group of consumers based on historical data and anticipate their payment habits and behaviors, a process that we refer to as “Scoring.” Scoring allows us to predict the likelihood that a customer will pay its debts and to tailor our debt collection strategies in order to efficiently collect final payments from end-customers. The process is tailored to account for specific circumstances and behaviors and also to minimize the impact on the customer relationship. For more information on our Scoring process, see “Business—Operations and service offerings—Credit Management Services— _Collection services.” We thereafter determine which collection method to use for the specific claim, including_ calls, letters, text messages, emails or personal visits by agents, depending on various factors including the geographic market, claim size, client on whose behalf we are acting, applicable laws and regulations, reputational concerns and the individual customer. We believe that our large scale and automated processes, complemented by our data assets and analytic capabilities, allows us to optimize collection costs and uniquely tailor debt collection strategies based on past experience. As a result, we believe that we are able to optimize collection efficiency over the lifetime of the claim.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

Therefore, the maximum credit exposure for each class of financial assets corresponds to the carrying amount.

To minimize the risks related to purchase of portfolios, caution is exercised in purchase decisions.

151,Final Offerings 2020.md,899,MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,899.11,MTN program,899.11.2,Significant accounting policies,"We adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers from January 1, 2018 and IFRS 16 Leases from January 1, 2019. Our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 included as comparative information in the audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 have not been restated to reflect the retrospective adoption of IFRS 15. Our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 (including comparative information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017), have not been restated to reflect the retrospective adoption of IFRS 16. The introduction of IFRS 15 has not had a material impact on our earnings or financial position. The principal effects of the application of IFRS 16 on Intrum’s accounting were that (i) the Group’s total assets increased by SEK 709 million as of January 1, 2019, with both an asset and a liability being reported for leases in effect, and (ii) operating earnings improved by SEK 43 million for the period ended December 31, 2019 through the implicit lease interest expense being reported in net financial items rather than in operating earnings. See “Presentation of Financial _and Other Information” and note 1 to the Issuer’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years_ ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. _Recognition of purchased portfolios, revenue recognition, accounting treatment of joint ventures, estimation of cash flow forecasts and revaluation of purchased portfolios_ The following sections describe how the IFRS accounting under the amortized cost methodology recognizes the portfolio investments book value in our consolidated statement of financial position and the returns generated through debt collections on such portfolios in our consolidated income statement. These IFRS measures are derived from a number of other measures that are not defined in IFRS and which involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity, including EIR and ERC, and these are areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the Issuer’s Audited Financial Statements. _Recognition of portfolio investments_ Portfolio investments consist of portfolios of delinquent consumer debt purchased at prices significantly below the nominal receivable. With effect from January 1, 2018, in accordance with the rules for loans and receivables under IFRS 9, which replaced IAS 39 (or, for any annual periods prior to January 1, 2018, according to IAS 39), portfolio investments are recognized at amortized cost according to the effective interest rate model. The new rules for portfolio investments require that we continue to report these according to an EIR model, with minor adjustments in application. The primary change is that, in accordance with IFRS 9, acquired credit-impaired receivables can be reported at a higher recognized value than cost if our estimates of future cash flows change, which differs from our application of the corresponding rules under IAS 39. The effect of this change is that earnings brought forward in the opening balance for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by SEK 50 million after tax. Comparative figures for previous years have not been recalculated. Income from portfolio investments is recognized in the income statement as the collected amount less amortization. The collection is often performed by the same personnel who handle collections and debt surveillance on behalf of external clients within the Credit Management Services segment and Strategic Markets segment. The cost of collection is debited internally at market price and expensed in the income statement for the Portfolio Investments segment as a cost of services. Reporting follows the effective interest method, where the carrying value of each portfolio corresponds to the present value of all projected future cash flows discounted by an initial EIR determined on the date the portfolio was acquired, based on the relation between purchase price cost and the projected future cash flows on the acquisition date. Changes in the portfolio investments book value are recognized as amortization for the period 80 ----- and included in the income statement on the revenue line. Compensation received from debt originators due to rejected cases and price adjustments made to purchased portfolios are recorded as an adjustment to the acquisition cost. In connection with the purchase of each portfolio of receivables, a projection for a period of 180 months is made of the portfolio’s cash flows. Cash flows include the loan amount, reminder fees, collection fees and late interest that, based on a probability assessment, are expected to be received from debtors, less forecast collection costs. With this forecast and the purchase price (including transaction costs) as a basis, each portfolio is assigned an initial EIR that is then used to discount cash flows through the life of the portfolio. Cash flow actual performance is compared against projections and monitored on a monthly basis for all portfolios, although adjustments to projections are only made after the first year. Projections are updated based on, among other things, achieved collection results, agreements reached with debtors on instalment plans and macroeconomic information. Cash flow projections are made at the portfolio level, since each portfolio of receivables consists of a small number of homogeneous amounts. On the basis of the updated cash flow projections and initial EIR, a new carrying value for the portfolio is calculated in the closing accounts. We are currently reassessing the methodology by which we adjust EIR. We expect to complete the assessment and implement the new methodology by December 31, 2020. The effects of changes in cash flow forecasts are referred to as revaluations and treated symmetrically, _i.e., both increases and decreases in forecast flows affect a given portfolio’s portfolio investments book value and,_ as a result, earnings. Prior to January 1, 2018, portfolios were not recognized at higher than cost. Effective January 1, 2018, we have applied IFRS 9 with the result that portfolios may be recognized at higher than cost if future cash flow forecasts change. Although selling portfolios of portfolio investments is not a part of our business model, when such sales do occur as an exception, the resulting sales price received for the portfolio is reported in the same way as if it had been collected from the debtors. The entire remaining carrying values of the portfolios are then recognized as amortization. From time to time, we also purchase portfolios on a forward flow basis. In a forward flow agreement, we agree to buy claims from a client on an ongoing basis at a pre-defined price or price range for a given volume and quality. Claims under forward flow agreements can be delivered on weekly, monthly or quarterly basis and the EIR of these claims is calculated per batch delivered. Each delivery under a forward flow agreement is treated as an individual portfolio purchase, using our own purchase cost and our own EIR calculation. _Recognition of revenue from portfolio investments_ Revenue on a portfolio investment is calculated as the total of the actual achieved gross collected amounts of the portfolio during each month, less portfolio investment amortization and adjusted for positive or negative portfolio investment revaluations. As a result of this methodology, revenue for a portfolio will correspond closely to its carrying value multiplied by the EIR that would have been determined if the calculation had been based on gross collections, adjusted for over- or under-performance and for revaluations. The table below sets forth an illustrative example of portfolio revenue recognition and changes in portfolio investments book value according our methodology under IFRS.

Payment is made in the form of a commission that is recognized as a cost within the Portfolio Investments segment. _Joint ventures_ In accordance with IFRS 11 Joint arrangements, we recognize our participations in joint ventures, in which we and other part-owners manage operations jointly in accordance with a shareholder agreement, in accordance with the equity method from the date on which joint control arises and such that we are entitled to net assets rather than having a direct entitlement to assets and responsibility for liabilities. Joint ventures are recognized at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net assets. In our consolidated income statement, our share of joint venture earnings is reported under Participations in the earnings of joint ventures. We do not recognize dividends received from joint ventures in the income statement, but instead reduce the carrying value of the investment. Shared operations are joint arrangements in which we and one or more partners are entitled to all of the financial benefits related to the assets of the operations. Shared operations are reported according to the profit split method under which each party to a joint venture reports its share of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. _Estimation of cash flow forecasts from portfolio investments_ The estimation of cash flow forecasts (i.e., ERC) is a key uncertainty within our policies on revenue recognition of portfolio investments. We establish estimates of cash flows that determine the EIR for each purchased portfolio. The estimates are based on our collection history with respect to portfolios comprising similar attributes and characteristics, such as date of purchase, debt originator, type of receivable, customer payment histories, customer location and the time since the original charge-off, as well as on our experience and the existing schedule of repayment plans on the particular portfolio for which we are determining EIR. _Revaluation of portfolio investments_ Prior to the end of each quarterly reporting period, we evaluate portfolio forecasts to assess whether there is objective evidence that a portfolio should be subject to revaluation. Indications of positive or negative revaluation primarily include any significant deviation against the currently active forecast for the portfolio, but also take into account an assessment of groups of customers experiencing financial difficulty, default of interest or principal payments, the probability that customers will enter into bankruptcy, debt restructuring or other financial reorganization and observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults. Conversely, there can also be a positive revaluation in the event that a portfolio displays objective evidence of expected cash flows above the currently active forecast. In practice, a number of portfolios are identified each quarter for potential revaluation. Generally, portfolios will be selected for potential revaluation only where (i) we have owned such portfolio for at least 12 months, (ii) net collections in the past 12 months, or since the latest revaluation within the past 12 months, for such portfolio have deviated more than 20% positively or negatively against the active forecast, (iii) net collections in the past 12 months for such portfolio have exceeded €100,000 or deviation in the last 12 months exceeds €250,000, and (iv) the current carrying value of such portfolio exceeds €10,000. Portfolios that do not fulfill all four of these criteria are not considered for revaluation unless a special request is made by country or regional management. Portfolios which fulfill all four criteria are considered as candidates for a potential revaluation and are analyzed by our staff at group and local levels to determine if the deviation in the past indicates a need to revise the forecast for the future. New forecasts may be generated using agreed-upon statistical methods. All changes in active collection forecasts are then signed off and agreed by our revaluation committee. A change in the collection forecast may be coupled with an adjustment of the applied EIR for portfolios within a certain range, whereby the carrying value remains unchanged for portfolios still performing within predefined limits. In the first half of 2020 our collection performance has been impacted by the economic downturn and closure of certain legal functions in certain of our key markets caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We have reflected this impact through our book value revaluations processes. In the six months ended June 30, 2020, we wrote down our portfolio investment by net SEK 633 million, which is 2.3% of our portfolio investment carrying 83 ----- value as of June 30, 2020.

We are currently party to the following joint venture arrangements. _Ithaca Investment DAC_ In April 2018, we entered into a partnership agreement with Intesa pertaining to the establishment of a shared Italian collection business and the securitization of non-performing loans originated by Intesa. In the context of the Intesa Partnership: - we acquired a majority 51% holding in a Italian collection business, Intrum Italy, to which Intesa contributed its service platform for overdue receivables, and Intrum contributed all of its Italian 88 ----- operations at the time (other than Cross Factor SpA and the holding company Lindorff Italy Srl). Intesa retains a 49% holding in Intrum Italy. In connection with this, Intrum Italy also entered into a 10-year exclusive servicing agreement with Intesa for the vast majority of Intesa’s new NPL inflow during this period. Intesa retains a 49% holding in Intrum Italy, and we therefore consolidate Intrum Italy’s results of operations. At the same time Intrum together with CarVal Investors acquired 51% of a portfolio of overdue receivables from Intesa, which is held by Penelope, an Italian special purpose vehicle, as described below. - through a new joint company, Ithaca Investment DAC (the “Intesa JV”), we own profit participating corresponding to 80% of the capital of the Intesa JV. The Intesa JV is subject, by agreement, to controlling influence shared by Intrum and CarVal Investors and we therefore report our interest in the jointly owned platform as a participation in a joint venture. The Intesa JV has invested in junior notes and mezzanine loans issued by Penelope. Penelope has invested in overdue receivables acquired from Intesa. Penelope also controls the property company, Savoy Reoco S.R.L., which assumes control of seized collateral in the form of properties. See “—Acquisitions, geographic _expansion and divestments.” Ibercaja Banco SA_ In December 2018, we reached an agreement to purchase 6,400 properties in Spain from Ibercaja Banco SA. The properties were transferred to a new company, Global Zappa SL, of which initially we were an 80% shareholder and a subsidiary of Ibercaja Banco SA was a 20% shareholder (the “Ibercaja JV”).

The decrease was primarily due to items affecting comparability of negative SEK 212 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to no items affecting comparability reported for the six months ended June 30, 2020. As a percentage of total revenue, sales, marketing and administrative expenses remained relatively stable, moving from 16% for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to 13% for the six months ended June 30, 2020. _Participations in joint ventures_ Our income from participations in joint ventures decreased from SEK 675 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 to SEK 183 million in the six months ended June 30, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to lower earnings from the Intesa JV and impact from the country lockdown due to COVID-19. _Operating earnings_ Our operating earnings decreased by SEK 1,015 million, or 36%, from SEK 2,822 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 to SEK 1,807 million in the six months ended June 30, 2020. Operating earnings include items affecting comparability of negative SEK 633 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to negative SEK 89 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. The increase was primarily due to revaluations of portfolio investments as a result of COVID-19. 90 ----- _Net financial items_ Our net financial items increased by SEK 235 million, or 31%, from negative SEK 748 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 to negative SEK 983 million in the six months ended June 30, 2020. The increase was primarily due to increased drawings under our Revolving Credit Facility in 2020 and costs associated with refinancing a portion of our Existing Notes and the issuance of the 2025 Notes. _Tax expense_ Our tax expense increased by SEK 271 million, or 59%, from SEK 456 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 to SEK 185 million in the six months ended June 30, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to lower earnings before tax. Tax expense as a percentage of earnings before tax was 23% for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 22% for the six months ended June 30, 2019. _Net earnings for the period_ Net earnings decreased by SEK 980 million, or 61%, from SEK 1,618 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 to SEK 638 million in the six months ended June 30, 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information” and “Management Discussion and _Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Significant factors affecting comparability—Significant Accounting Policies.” Total revenue_ Our total revenue increased by SEK 2,543 million, or 19%, from SEK 13,442 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 to SEK 15,985 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 with organic growth accounting for -2%, acquisitions for 18% (including Solvia, the Intesa partnership and the Piraeus partnership), portfolio revaluations for 0% and currency effects for 3%. This decrease in organic growth was primarily due to the loss of maturing high margin business process outsourcing contracts in Spain. Growth in total revenue was primarily due to acquisitions and our Intesa Partnership. Growth in our Portfolio Investments segment was primarily due to a full-year contribution from the Intesa JV that completed in December 2018, and favorable underlying growth in the other portfolio operations. For the year ended December 31, 2019, investments in portfolio investments amounted to SEK 7,324 million compared to investments of SEK 11,854 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, which contributed to an increase in book value for purchased receivables of 15% over the period. The decrease in portfolio investments was primarily due to joint venture portfolio acquired in December 2018. 91 ----- The table below sets forth our total revenue by segment, each segment ‘s operating total revenue as a percentage of consolidated total revenue and the associated percentage increase or decrease for the periods indicated.

Payment is made in the form of a commission that is recognized as a cost within the Portfolio Investments segment. _Cost of sales_ Our cost of sales increased by SEK 2,438 million, or 33%, from SEK 7,369 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 to SEK 9,807 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by a greater volume of demand, both organically and due to acquisitions, for our CMS services, which has a direct corresponding impact on collections related costs, including employee-related costs, expensed legal outlays and sending letters. Cost of sales includes items affecting comparability that increased to negative SEK 819 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to negative SEK 60 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, which increase primarily related to costs associated with our efficiency program. As a percentage of total revenue, cost of sales increased from 55% in the year ended December 31, 2018 to 61% in the year ended December 31, 2019. _Sales, marketing and administrative expenses_ Our sales, marketing and administrative expenses increased by SEK 383 million, or 18%, from SEK 2,170 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 to SEK 2,553 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to acquisitions and costs corresponding with increased volume of services being provided, and items affecting comparability of negative SEK 834 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to negative SEK 773 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. As a percentage of total revenue, sales, marketing and administrative expenses remained relatively stable from 16% in the year ended December 31, 2018 to 16% in the year ended December 31, 2019. _Provisions for credit losses on accounts receivable_ Our provisions from credit losses on accounts receivable increased by SEK 13 million, or 42%, from negative SEK 31 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 to negative SEK 44 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to increased sales revenues in Southern Europe. _Participations in joint ventures_ Our income from participations in joint ventures increased by SEK 1,073 million, or 1,012%, from SEK 106 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 to SEK 1,179 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due to a full-year’s contribution from the Intesa JV completed in December 2018. _Operating earnings_ Our operating earnings decreased by SEK 1,918 million, or 48%, from SEK 3,978 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 to SEK 2,060 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to goodwill impairment in our Iberian Peninsula and Latin America cash generating unit to reflect the underlying servicing business in Spain developing below expectations. In addition, costs related to our efficiency program also impacted earnings adversely. This was partially offset by a full year’s contribution from the Intesa JV that completed in December 2018 and the Intesa Partnership, as well as three-month’s contribution from the acquisition of our interest in Intrum Hellas and strategic partnership with Piraeus Bank. Earnings include items affecting comparability of negative SEK 4,148 million, of which negative SEK 2,700 million relates to goodwill impairment and SEK 28 million relates to revaluations, in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to negative SEK 522 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Accordingly, operating earnings excluding non 92 ----- recurring items, items affecting comparability and revaluations increased to SEK 6,208 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 from SEK 4,500 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. _Net financial items_ Our net financial items increased by SEK 558 million, or 44%, from negative SEK 1,363 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 to negative SEK 1,921 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Financial cost increased primarily due to increase in financial expenses. The increase in financial expense was SEK 561 million primarily due to increase in net debt and non-recurring early redemption cost of debt securities during 2019. Exchange rate differences had a positive impact of SEK 18 million on net financial items for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to SEK 19 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. _Tax expense_ Our tax expense decreased by SEK 175 million, or 29%, from SEK 599 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 to SEK 424 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, correlating with the decrease in earnings before tax. Tax expense as a percentage of earnings before tax increased to 306% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 23% for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to a non-deductible impairment of goodwill in 2019. _Net earnings for the period_ Net earnings for the period decreased by SEK 2,228 million, or 115%, from SEK 1,943 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 to negative SEK 285 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

Financial cost increased primarily due to a full, rather than half, year of interest expense associated with the June 2017 94 ----- Notes. The increase in financial expense was itself partly offset by lower non-recurring other financial items in 2018 (compared to SEK 316 million for the year ended December 31, 2017) as a result of fees and expenses related to the June 2017 Notes incurred in 2017.

Excluding foreign currency effect, total revenue of our Credit Management Services segment decreased by 4% in the six months ended June 30, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the negative impact from COVID-19 temporarily causing lower inflow of cases, although certain countries are gradually approaching to normalized levels of commercial activity at different rates dependent on local easing of country lockdowns. Strategic Markets segment: total revenue of our Strategic Markets segment increased by SEK 650 million, or 36%, from SEK 1,809 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 to SEK 2,459 million in the six months ended June 30, 2020. Excluding foreign currency effect, total revenue of our Strategic Markets segment increased by 35% in the six months ended June 30, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the Piraeus Partnership that completed in October 2019. Portfolio Investments segment: total revenue of our Portfolio Investments segment decreased by SEK 772 million, or 22%, from SEK 3,492 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 to SEK 2,720 million in the six months ended June 30, 2020. Excluding foreign currency effect, adjusted revenue of our Portfolio Investments segment decreased by 3% in the six months ended June 30, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to weaker collections due to the negative impact from COVID-19. _Segment earnings_ An analysis of our operating earnings by segment is set forth below: Credit Management Services segment: operating earnings of our Credit Management Services segment decreased by SEK 41 million, or 5%, from SEK 844 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 to SEK 803 million in the six months ended June 30, 2020. Excluding non-recurring items and foreign currency effect, operating earnings of our Credit Management Services segment decreased by 8% in the six months ended June 30, 2020. The decrease in operating earnings was primarily due to lower revenues, partially offset by savings from the efficiency improvements program completed at the end of 2019. Strategic Markets segment: operating earnings of our Strategic Markets segment decreased by SEK 128 million, or 22%, from SEK 575 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 to SEK 447 million in the six months ended June 30, 2020. Excluding non-recurring items and foreign currency effect, operating earnings of our Strategic Markets Services segment increased by 1% in the six months ended June 30, 2020. The increase in segment operating earnings was primarily due to the Piraeus Partnership completed in October 2019, largely offset by the negative impact from COVID-19 that led the country-wide lockdowns in Spain and Italy. Portfolio Investments segment: operating earnings of our Portfolio Investments segment decreased by SEK 1,114 million, or 44%, from SEK 2,520 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 to SEK 1,406 million in the six months ended June 30, 2020. Excluding non-recurring items and foreign currency effect, operating earnings of our Portfolio Investments segment decreased by 18% in the six months ended June 30, 2020.

The increase was primarily due to the full year impact in 2019 of the Italian joint venture portfolio that was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2018 as well as underlying growth in other portfolio operations. _Segment earnings_ An analysis of our operating earnings by service line is set forth below: Credit Management Services service line: operating earnings of our Credit Management Services service line decreased by SEK 2,848 million, or 117%, from SEK 2,433 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 to negative SEK 415 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was due to the underlying business in Spain developing below expectations resulting in a goodwill impairment in the Iberian Peninsula and Latin America cash generating unit. The underperformance in our Spanish servicing business had a negative impact on the operating margin for the year, which was partially offset by favorable developments in other countries. Portfolio Investments service line: operating earnings of our Portfolio Investments service line increased by SEK 1,361 million, or 39%, from SEK 3,600 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 to SEK 4,961 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.

Following the Merger, our primary source of liquidity has been borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and cash flow from operations. Additional key sources of liquidity include the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility and capital markets transactions. Historically, our collections have generated a stable and predictable cash flow throughout the year in contrast to the debt purchasing activities, which vary between quarters. Our debt purchasing activities are driven by supply of portfolios in the market, which we do not control, and our willingness to invest in any particular available assets at the prevailing price. This can lead to volatility in our free cash flow on a quarter by quarter basis. For example, in 2019 our quarterly cash flow from investing activities varied between negative SEK 242 million and negative SEK 7,169 million. Our operating cash flow generation depends on our future operating performance which to an extent is dependent on the general economic environment, market competition and the regulatory environment in jurisdictions in which we operate.

See “Risk Factors” for a discussion of these and other factors. _Foreign exchange risk_ We operate internationally and are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the Euro, NOK, Hungarian Forint and Swiss Franc, in relation to our reporting currency Swedish kronor. Foreign exchange risk arises from recognized assets and liabilities, net investments in foreign operations and any future commercial transactions involving foreign exchange. Exchange rate risk can be divided into transaction exposure and translation exposure. We have investments in foreign operations and the associated net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk. Our strategy is to manage and limit exchange rate risk through forward exchange contracts and currency interest rate swaps. For further information on foreign exchange risk see Notes 1 and 33 in the Issuer’s audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 and notes 1 and 34 in the Issuer’s audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. To an extent, we manage currency exposure arising from the net assets of our foreign operations through external loans in foreign currency and derivatives. - Transaction Exposure: revenue and operating expenses derived from national operations are primarily denominated in local currencies and thus currency fluctuations have only a limited impact on our operating earnings in local currency. Revenue and expenses from national operations are thus hedged in a natural way, which limits transaction exposure. Our international debt collection and debt purchasing options, however, are exposed to currency risk. In addition, our existing indebtedness is primarily denominated in euro and SEK, and the amounts incurred in euro and SEK do not necessarily match the cash flows generated from operations in such currencies. - Translation Exposure: we have operations in 25 countries. Our results of operations and financial position is reported in the relevant foreign currencies and later translated into SEK for inclusion our financial statements. In the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, 94%, 93% and 91%, respectively, of our revenue was generated in a currency other than SEK.

151,Final Offerings 2020.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.1,Introduction,521.1.1,,"Debt is created when a debt originator extends credit to a person, or a legal entity, who in turn becomes a customer. Such arrangements occur routinely and include financial institutions extending loans or trade sector companies (including, _inter alia, telecommunications and utilities companies) issuing invoices for services rendered. When a debtor does not repay the debt according to the terms on which it was extended, the debt becomes overdue. Overdue debt is a structural component of the credit industry, as debt originators typically expect a certain percentage of customers to default, and price credit accordingly. Overdue debt is either collected by the originator itself or by a credit management company, such as us.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521
151,Final Offerings 2020.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.2,Overview of the European credit management services and debt purchasing industry,521.2.1,Debt purchasing,"Debt originators will often sell overdue debt to credit management companies through either: (i) a one-off sale of an entire NPL portfolio; or (ii) a forward flow agreement where debt claims are sold at a pre-defined price for a given volume from a client on an ongoing basis. One-off agreements entail buying a portfolio of claims that are received in one transaction upon payment. Forward flow agreements entail buying a given volume of claims at a pre-defined price or price range from a client on an ongoing basis. Selling overdue debt helps debt originators increase their liquidity, strengthen their balance sheets, release resources to focus on early-stage delinquencies and reduce operational risks, reporting requirements and regulatory demands. How overdue debt is sold is dependent on the debt originators’ needs and balance sheet strategy. In the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis there was a pressing need for financial institutions to quickly de-lever balance sheets and therefore NPL sales focused on larger one-off transactions. Over the last years, we have observed a less immediate but continuous need for banks to improve their capitalization, and as a result we see an increasing trend towards forward-flow contracts as an additional measure for banks to manage NPL portfolios on an ongoing basis. The decision to sell overdue debt can occur at one of several stages throughout the debt collection cycle, depending on the type of debt, pricing and time since default. Typically, debt is sold after more than one year in default and following the performance of various non-legal and legal measures.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521
151,Final Offerings 2020.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.2,Overview of the European credit management services and debt purchasing industry,521.2.2,Market segments,"The markets for CMS and debt purchasing are typically generated from two sources: financial institutions and trade. Debt can also be broken down by client type, specifically consumer (“B2C”) and corporate (“B2B”) debt. _Financial institution generated debt_ Consumer debt originated by financial institutions primarily consists of bank loans and typically includes mortgages, credit card loans, car loans, overdrafts and consumer loans. When such loans become more than 90 days overdue, they are categorized as NPLs. These are typically characterized by a relatively high average value and long collection times. Typically bank loans are further divided into unsecured (e.g., credit card) and secured (e.g., mortgage) loans. We view the credit management services market for debt originated by the financial institutions sector as highly sophisticated. Historically, we have focused on unsecured consumer debt originated by financial institutions, with an average annual collection performance for unsecured consumer collections from 2000 to 2019 of 103%. We have in recent years expanded our footprint and capabilities in the secured debt market segment. In 2016, we acquired 85% of Aktua in Spain, with Santander holding the remaining 15%. In 2018, we acquired Solvia from Banco Sabadell, one of the leading real estate service providers in Spain with more than €21 billion assets under management, entered into a long-term strategic partnership with Intesa, creating a market leading servicer of secured and unsecured non-performing loans in Italy and also acquired a portfolio of 6,400 REOs from Ibercaja and its affiliates, allowing us to extend Aktua’s servicing contracts. In 2019, we also acquired an 80% stake in Piraeus Bank’s Recovery Banking Unit platform, creating a long-term strategic partnership with Piraeus which retained a 20 per cent ownership. Consequently, we define all consumer debt originated by financial institutions as our core addressable market (the “Core Addressable Market”). In addition to our Core Addressable Market we also address the market for B2B debt originated by financial institutions to small and medium-sized enterprises (“SMEs”). We also opportunistically cover the large corporates segment and therefore include the total European B2B market for debt originated by financial institutions in our total addressable market (the “Addressable",N/A,as_expected,2020,521
151,Final Offerings 2020.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.2,Overview of the European credit management services and debt purchasing industry,521.2.3,,"There are a number of stages in the debt lifecycle and credit management companies offer several services to clients throughout the cycle. A number of credit management services are exemplified in the following illustration and described in the text below. The Credit Management Services (CMS) industry can be divided into the following two sub-segments: _Payment, information and invoice services_ Before debt originators extend credit to debtors, credit management companies provide credit scoring and other forms of credit information services such as data extraction and modelling. Credit management companies also provide payment processing services including invoice administration, subsidiary ledger accounting, invoice printing, payment reminders and invoice purchasing. These services are provided before debt is overdue. _Debt collection_ Credit management companies provide debt collection services to debt originators for overdue debt. The debt collection process consists of three phases: pre-legal, legal and enforcement and surveillance. The pre-legal phase is the first stage in debt recovery and is where the collector seeks to find a voluntary solution with the 102 ----- debtor, for example through a payment plan. If it is unlikely that the debtor will pay voluntarily even if that person could afford to pay and/or was aware of the claim, the case is moved to the legal and enforcement phase where the court system is used to find a solution, for example through garnishment of wages or sale of collateral. If the debtor is insolvent and the claim is uncollectable the case moves to the surveillance phase. During this phase, debtors are monitored for any changes in personal circumstances, such as employment status, that may allow debtors to commence payment.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

Based on European Banking Authority (“EBA”) data, we estimate the stock of European NPLs on",521.3.1,,"banks’ balance sheets as of December 31, 2019 stood at €0.6 trillion. This figure (i) does not include NPLs held by non-bank entities and therefore does not include the large volumes of NPLs sold over the years to credit funds or debt purchasers such as ourselves and (ii) includes NPLs relating to the large corporate segment, which we only compete in on an opportunistic basis, as well as B2B debt to SMEs, both of which are not a part of our Core 103 ----- Addressable Market. As a result, the stock of NPLs in our Core Addressable Market is significantly smaller than our Addressable Market. _Trade_ OTRs mainly consist of overdue invoices from corporations. A number of industries are included in the sector, such as telecommunication, public sector, retail and utility companies. Compared to the financial institutions sector, debt portfolios originating from the trade sector that are serviced or purchased by credit management companies typically consist of a larger number of debt claims with a lower average value and relatively short collection times. We expect the market outlook for overdue debt in the trade sector to remain stable over the coming years.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

We have identified certain key market trends that we believe are particularly important to the further development of the credit management services industry in general and in particular the further development of the financial institutions sector: - continued elevated level of NPLs on banks’ balance sheets; - continued creation of new NPLs; - continued sale of NPLs as banks are under pressure to de-lever and not accumulate new stocks; - increasing amount of NPLs owned outside the banking systems and requiring servicing; and - clear industry value proposition resulting in increased volume of outsourcing,N/A,as_expected,2020,521

Italy, France, Spain and Greece account for the largest proportion of the NPL volumes and make up over 60% of total NPL volumes. From a macroeconomic perspective, we expect credit related to mortgages, consumer and SME/Corporate to grow over the coming years for the sourced countries. We believe this credit expansion will have an increasing impact on NPLs over time. In addition, while the exact magnitude remains uncertain, we saw European banks’ cost of risk on average more than double during the first three months of 2020 amid the COVID-19 crisis. The first three months of 2020 also saw the largest increase in loan loss provisions for European banks since the 2008 financial crisis. This uptick in a key underlying driver is a strong indication of large NPL volumes we expect to come to market.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

The 2008 - 2010 global financial crisis accelerated the build-up of NPLs in the European banking system driven by, inter alia, increased default rates coupled with limited NPL sales activity. The European bank NPL stock increased from approximately €0.4 trillion in 2007 to approximately €1.2 trillion in 2013. European bank NPL stock has subsequently decreased to approximately €0.6 trillion as of December 31, 2019 due to banks’ focusing on deleveraging, primarily via debt sales, but remains at more than 1.5 times the level of NPLs’ observed prior to the global financial crisis.

151,Final Offerings 2020.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.6,Continued sale of NPLs as banks are under pressure to de-lever and not accumulate new stocks,521.6.1,,"There are a number of underlying factors for the high level of NPL sales volumes in recent years. In addition to the buildup of NPLs on banks’ balance sheets, stricter regulations and increased provisioning levels have incentivized banks to de-lever and sell NPLs in recent years. Additionally, selling NPLs often provides banks with immediate benefits to liquidity and a positive impact to the profit and loss statements if the NPLs sold have been substantially written down or written off. Increased regulatory pressure and supervision (through, inter alia, continuation of annual European Banking Authority stress-tests and stronger supervisory mechanisms, such as Single Supervisory Mechanism, Single Resolution Board and European Systemic Risk Board), higher capital requirements for financial institutions as a result of Revised Basel III coupled with the implementation of IFRS 9 and European Central Bank guidance on prudential provisioning of non-performing loans, is expected to further drive banks to strengthen their balance sheets and continue NPL sales. Minimum loss coverage for non-performing exposures under CRR (as defined below) is currently a key regulatory issue confronting banks and their balance sheets: _Minimum loss coverage for non-performing exposures under Capital Requirements Regulation_ (“CRR”): Regulation (EU) 2019 / 630 amending the CRR came into effect April 2019, and requires banks to take an additional deduction from capital where non-performing exposures (“NPEs”) are not sufficiently covered by other existing adjustments. An NPE, for the purposes of the new rules, includes an exposure in default per the CRR definition, exposures considered to be impaired under the accounting framework, an exposure under probation where additional forbearance measures are granted or the exposure becomes more than 30 days past due, and a commitment which is unlikely to be repaid and a guarantee which is likely to be called. Under the new regulation, unsecured NPEs must be written off after 3 years while secured NPEs must be written off after 7 years. NPEs secured by residential/commercial property or guaranteed residential loans must be written off after 9 years. The aim of this regulation is to encourage banks to write off exposures more readily, thus accelerating the clean-up of their balance sheets, as well as to create a secondary market for NPEs. Given these developments, we expect banks to increasingly manage NPLs in a proactive manner leading to more regular sales of fresher NPLs.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

At the same time, mature credit management providers have emerged and added value to banks through their proven track record of improving recoveries and scale benefits. Debt collection requires a substantial amount of resources and know-how, and we believe this is performed most efficiently by specialists. Consequently, credit management providers have become an integral part of the credit industry and are frequently viewed as trusted partners to their clients. We believe that this relationship will continue to grow in the coming years, particularly in markets with lower outsourcing ratios, such as Germany and Italy. In addition to the overall increase in outsourcing of debt collection, we also see a trend where clients increasingly demand outsourcing solutions from credit management companies at a regional or pan-European level. As a leading European credit management company, we believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from this trend.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

Cerberus, Blackstone and Lone Star have been the most active such buyers in the European NPL market with approximately €200 billion of portfolios purchased for the period between 2014 to October 2019. These funds tend to outsource collections to entities providing debt collection services. Additionally, most funds tend to manage portfolios for a period of time and eventually sell the portfolios in secondary trades. Accordingly, we expect secondary sales to increase once the funds who took part in the first such wave of purchases begin to exit their investments. Lone Star, for example, sold approximately €9 billion of portfolios during the period from 2014 to October 2019. The graph below shows the top 20 most active buyers from 2014 to October 2019 (in € billions). 105 ----- _Source: Deleveraging Europe October 2019, Deloitte Financial Advisory Note: Intrum purchases of €24.3 billion presented in the graph above do not represent the entirety of Intrum’s investments for the period._",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

When viewing the competitive landscape, three factors should be considered: - _Product offering: Companies either offer a full-service business model and operate in all stages of the credit management value chain, or they focus on particular areas, such as debt collection or debt purchasing. - _Geographic presence: Smaller participants tend to only operate in local markets. Medium and large companies typically have broader geographical footprints while only a few firms, including us, have operations across multiple European countries. - _Scale: The majority of firms are small or mid-sized and have a limited geographic presence, scale, skills, experience and information. In contrast, larger firms have the necessary scale to provide a complete value proposition. Based on these considerations, the industry can be grouped into three categories of participants: (1) Integrated pan-European credit management companies We are one of the few large credit management companies in Europe, which we define as being present in more than five markets with an integrated offering throughout the credit management value chain. These companies typically have operations in several countries and a broad value proposition, including both debt 106 ----- collection and debt purchasing. The large companies have experienced strong growth and high profitability in recent years by capitalizing on scale in skills, experience, information and origination sources. The large integrated pan-European credit management companies generally have different focuses and value propositions. Such pan-European competitors include Lowell and Cabot. We believe our complete value proposition in combination with our focus on the financial institutions sector is attractive to potential clients and will enable us to capture anticipated growth opportunities across a variety of markets in the future. (2) Regional credit management companies Most European credit management companies are SMEs active only in one or few local markets, and have varying scale and business focuses. While these companies have a presence in their domestic markets, they have a limited or non-existing international presence. This segment also consists of several thousand participants without sizable operations who tend to focus on debt collection, as it has lower scale requirements. In addition to smaller credit management companies focusing on debt collection, there are a number of larger scale monoline players, which we define as having a presence in less than five geographic markets and/or who predominantly focus on debt purchasing. Monoline and regional credit management companies include PRA Group, Hoist and Kruk. (3) Portfolio investors The third group of participants in the credit management industry comprises international investors specializing in acquisitions of portfolios with distressed assets, such as Cerberus Capital Management, Lone Star Funds and Fortress Investment Group. The core competency of portfolio investors is the evaluation of portfolios and the raising of capital. Portfolio investors compete with other credit management companies in the debt purchasing segment; however they can also be strategic partners since they typically outsource debt collection. In recent years, we have created a co-investment vehicle and acted as a co-investor together with portfolio investors to acquire portfolios and have handled the debt collection process relating to the portfolios acquired.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

Through our Portfolio Investments segment, we offer a range of portfolio investment financial services, including our REO offering. Our portfolio investment financial services focuses on the purchase portfolios of secured and unsecured loans and other overdue receivables from our clients for a portion of their nominal value, which we generally then service using our in-house debt collection function. Upon purchase of defaulted receivables, we put in place long-term debt collection measures aimed at helping customers become debt-free as we work together to reduce their debt. In line with our core values, which are based on an empathetic and ethical approach to helping indebted customers become debt free in a respectful manner, we interact with every customer to craft solutions on the basis of their individual circumstances, for example through instalment plans that take account of each consumer’s payment capacity. As part of our Portfolio Investments segment, we also provide factoring, payment guarantees and e-commerce services. Our Portfolio Investments segment also houses our REO offering (including our REO offering in Brazil, Greece, Italy and Spain), which includes, either in the course of recovery activities for secured loans (or, infrequently, in relation to unsecured loans with personal guarantees) or as a standalone investment strategy, directly or indirectly and independently or alongside co-investors, holding title to real estate that we expect to eventually resell. We arrange for the sale of such real estate using internal and external resources and networks. Our real estate exposure within our Portfolio Investment segment is concentrated in Italy, Hungary, Portugal and Spain. Properties are either wholly owned or held by joint ventures in which we participate along with our co-investors. Our properties, including both wholly owned properties and properties held by joint ventures in which we participate along with our co-investors, total to approximately 5,816 properties. The book value of real estate assets in our consolidated balance sheet together with our joint ventures' book value related to properties as of June 30, 2020 was SEK 765 million.

As of June 30, 2020, the ERC of our portfolios of loans and overdue receivables was SEK 64,674 million (€6,162 million equivalent). We believe that the combination of our debt collection services, portfolio investments expertise and strategic financial institution partnerships has been and will continue to be key to our success. Our complete range of services helps attract and retain clients and increases the breadth and depth of collectible data, in turn supporting the creation of tailored collection strategies and development of analytical capabilities to more accurately price portfolios. Operating across Europe with an integrated and balanced business model also gives us investment optionality as we can allocate resources across our platform and jurisdictions to pursue the opportunities that we find most attractive.

We also believe that our scale, leading positions, full scope of services across the entire CMS value chain and our broad geographic footprint allow us to provide an increasingly attractive value proposition for our largest clients, who provide us with increasing sources of opportunities across Europe and enable us to efficiently allocate capital to opportunities with the best risk/reward profiles. 110 ----- _Market leading position in several European countries_ We are present in 24 European countries, which is more than any of our European competitors. Based on our internal estimates, we believe we hold a leading position in the majority of those countries. We believe our broad geographic footprint combined with strong local market positions is a competitive advantage which continues to enhance our ability to serve our existing clients with a complete value proposition across diverse markets and the entire CMS value chain and also to expand client relationships. _Leading position in the European financial institutions segment_ Based on our internal estimates, we believe that we hold one of the leading positions among credit management providers with respect to financial institutions clients in Europe. We believe that the financial institutions segment in Europe continues to represent one of the most attractive segments of the credit management market. Financial institutions are the largest originator of debt and, based on data from the EBA, European bank NPL stock amounted to approximately SEK 7 trillion (€0.6 trillion equivalent) as of December 31, 2019. The financial institutions segment also offers attractive economics with long durations and high earnings visibility. We have a long track record of collecting on NPLs and have built long-term relationships with European financial institutions. During the three years ended December 31, 2019, we acquired NPLs with a total collectible value on portfolio investments of SEK 441,895 million (€42,298 million equivalent) from European financial institutions. For the year ended December 31, 2019, 80% of revenue in our Portfolio Investments segment was generated by portfolios acquired from financial institutions. In addition, we have a strong track record in entering into strategic partnerships with financial institutions, including long-term servicing contracts and often the carve-out of operational servicing platforms. _Leading position in the European trade segment for credit management services and portfolio investments_ Based on our internal estimates, we believe that we hold a leading position among credit management providers in providing servicing and acquisition of OTR to non-financial services companies in Europe. The OTR segment complements the financial institutions segment as it offers a relatively stable and high volume of stock with short duration. In many of the markets in which we operate, we believe OTR flow will remain relatively consistent with historic high levels, driven by a structural shift towards a higher proportion of pay-later payment options, including invoice payments, installment payment plans and checkout payment plans, which are pay-later plans provided by Klarna, a Swedish online financial service provider which handles customer payments, and financing options, and increased outsourcing of CMS operations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

Our predominant activities are in the CMS and portfolio investments spheres. Additionally, within our Credit Management Services segment and Strategic Markets segment, we offer clients attractive value-added services before loans and receivables become overdue, including information, invoice and payment services, which are an important source of origination for our Credit Management Services segment, Strategic Markets segment and Portfolio Investments segment and for our data collection. Our broad product and value proposition is complemented by our ability to offer flexible solutions to our clients, including by leveraging our market-leading capabilities in the carving-out of financial institutions’ in-house collection units, co-investment structures and the provision of RES. _Ability to acquire and service several types of loans_ Historically, we have focused on unsecured consumer debt originated by financial institutions and OTRs originated by the non-financial sector. In recent years, we have also increased our activities in the secured consumer debt market segment, including through key acquisitions such as the June 2016 acquisition of 85% of Aktua, one of the leading credit management companies in the secured NPL segment in Spain, with Santander holding the remaining 15%, which strengthened our RES capabilities in the Spanish market, in particular with regard to servicing Intrum- or third-party owned real estate, the purchase of a real estate portfolio from Ibercaja in December 2018, which we hold with a co-investor, which bolstered our REO capabilities in the Spanish market and our acquisition in April 2019, of 80% of Solvia, which offers real estate management services in the Spanish market and which further built out our RES capabilities. We now work with secured assets in 12 countries, further demonstrating our capabilities across diverse types of loans. 111 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,521
151,Final Offerings 2020.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.19,Our Strengths,521.19.3,"Integrated client offering spanning the Credit Management Services, Strategic Markets and Portfolio Investments segments","_Data analytics_ Our broad value proposition allows us to collect data from across the CMS value chain and extract data synergies to continuously strengthen our data analytics capabilities. We believe data analytics and business intelligence are key to driving optimized collection strategies and accurately and competitively pricing the portfolios for which we bid. We estimate that we have collected depersonalized data on over 285 million claims from across our three segments. We also estimate that we have a data warehouse consisting of over 7.3 billion events, such as payments and actions taken, associated with the claims on which we have collected depersonalized data. _Operational synergies_ The combined scale we achieve through the breadth of our value proposition as well as our pan-European footprint provides us with economies of skill and scale. Given the scalable nature of our business model, operational synergies are important drivers of increased operational efficiency. We have successfully recognized significant cost synergies associated with the Merger. In the year ended December 31, 2019, the process of realizing the synergies from the Merger was completed with these amounting to SEK 680 million (€65 million equivalent), exceeding the SEK 560 million (€59 million equivalent) expected at the time of the Merger. See “—Our _Strategy—Continue to drive profitability through operational excellence and realization of operational synergies.” Financial complementarity_ With our integrated and balanced business model we can solve for our clients’ needs and offer a value proposition across the CMS value chain. Additionally, we benefit from the financial complementarity between our Credit Management Services segment and Strategic Markets segment, on one hand, and our Portfolio Investments segment, on the other hand, whereby capital light revenues from the Credit Management Services segment (SEK 4,559 million (€428 million equivalent) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020) and Strategic Markets segment (SEK 4,819 million (€452 million equivalent) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020) generate cash which can be deployed in our Portfolio Investments segment for portfolio investments and deleveraging.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

We have capabilities with respect to financial institutions as well as across multiple trade sectors, including utilities, telecommunications and retail, which allows flexible capital deployment for portfolio investments and enhance our ability to identify and take advantage of trends in various sectors across our segments. Furthermore, we benefit from our significant successful experience in executing co-investments which provides us with the resources to swiftly capitalize on market opportunities, allowing us to acquire larger and more mixed portfolios. Additionally our centrally organized AAG, which focuses on secured and sizeable B2B transactions, gives us the capacity and capability to address large, complex and sensitive transactions, as well as centrally coordinate and attract co-investors and secure additional sources of funding, as demonstrated by our Intesa Partnership and the acquisition of Ibercaja’s REO portfolio, which we hold with a co-investor. In addition to these transactions generating revenues, these transactions also act as growth accelerators by generating subsequent contracts to service the acquired portfolios, while requiring a lower level of upfront capital investment. Our extensive pan-European presence also allows us to provide CMS services to, and increase our share of wallet with, clients who have cross-border and cross-service activities. _Long-term relationships with our CMS clients_ We have an impressive track record of maintaining long-term relationships with our largest clients and we have also historically achieved high levels of repeat purchases from existing customers, which we believe evidences the strength of our product and value proposition. Of our 10 largest clients in the Credit Management Services segment, 5 have had a relationship with us lasting more than 10 years, of which 4 have had a relationship of more than 15 years and the relationship with our largest client in this segment extends beyond 25 years. 112 ----- _Large number of repeat and small purchases_ For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, we purchased SEK 1,449 million (€136 million equivalent) of loans and other overdue receivables under forward flow contracts, providing visibility on new business origination. Additionally, over the same period, we made SEK 595 million (€56 million equivalent) of smaller purchases of portfolios of less than SEK 20 million (€2 million equivalent) in size. As of June 30, 2020, our average portfolio investment claim size was SEK 20,218 (€1,929 equivalent). _CMS enables a competitive tendering process benefitting the portfolio investment part of our business_ When bidding for portfolios from existing clients in our Credit Management Services segment and Strategic Markets segment, we are able to leverage our existing business relationship, we can accurately and competitively price portfolios that we find attractive and offer an attractive value proposition to clients that is informed by our knowledge of, and provision of other services to, the specific client and portfolio. _Significant supply of NPLs in the market_ Based on data from the EBA, European bank NPL stock amounted to approximately SEK 7 trillion (€0.6 trillion equivalent) as of December 31, 2019, representing more than 1.5 times the 2007 levels. We expect continued regular and pro-active sales by banks as they manage a broad range of new rules and regulations such as, for example, Basel IV, IFRS 9 and ECB calendar provisioning. As a result, we anticipate an increase in debt sales as a proportion of NPL stock. Ultimately, the evolution of NPL stock depends on the macroeconomic situations of the countries in question. For example, in a favorable macroeconomic environment, NPL generation is more muted, as evidenced by NPL levels over the last few years. Following a downturn, such as is currently being experienced on a global level in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we would generally expect an increase in the generation of new NPLs.

We have historically undertaken a range of initiatives aimed at improving our collection and margins and that we believe will continue to improve the performance of our business. These include, among other things: - _standardization: consolidating infrastructure among subsidiaries, aligning operational processes and reducing the number of physical collection sites and IT and virtual collection systems; - _data management:_ centralizing data pools and implementing data cleansing techniques and analytical tools to support enhanced decision-making; - _digitalization and automation: investing in self-service consumer and client portals and software to facilitate timely and transparent communication and proactive management of credit management services; and - _shared services:_ consolidating and near-shoring shared services and continuing to evaluate expansion to additional service centers, with our shared service centre more than doubling in size since year-end 2017. In addition, we have successfully recognized significant cost synergies associated with the Merger. In the year ended December 31, 2019, the process of realizing the synergies from the Merger was completed with these amounting to SEK 680 million (€65 million equivalent), exceeding the SEK 560 million (€59 million equivalent) expected at the time of the Merger.

151,Final Offerings 2020.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.19,Our Strengths,521.19.6,Strong embedded risk culture,"We benefit from well-defined and multi-layered risk management frameworks and a rigorous approach to maintaining pricing discipline that we believe will continue to support profitability through active and effective 113 ----- management of pricing, reputation and regulatory risks throughout our investment decision-making process. Through the breadth and depth of our experience across the CMS value chain, we have access to comprehensive databases of purchased and serviced debt to which we apply our data analysis capabilities in order to take a centralized approach to forecasting and pricing. Our centralized forecasting and pricing is further supported by specialist local input, ensuring that the pricing of each portfolio benefits from a strong cross-organizational evaluation. Our data capabilities also facilitate more efficient debt collection strategies through data analytics and cross-learning. In addition, our three-tiered risk management approach helps ensure that our sophisticated pricing information is used in an investment decision-making context that is grounded in compliance and the maintenance of strong internal controls. Our focus on risk management and compliance is incorporated into our structure at the local level, which is our first line of defense, and up through both the internal and independent external risk control and auditing functions that are carried out at our executive and Board levels. All of our portfolio acquisitions are subject to a standardized process involving independent review by our risk function, which reports to our Chief Risk Officer, and our investment authority, which reports to our Chief Investment Officer (both the Chief Risk Officer and Chief Investment Officer, together with other relevant stakeholders, are part of our Risk and Investment Committee), with the largest transactions requiring approval by our Board of Directors. We believe that our focus on pricing discipline and risk management has historically enabled us to consistently outperform our forecasted collections. From January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2020, on a quarterly basis, we collected 103 – 115% of our cash flow forecasts.

In the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we reported Adjusted Cash EBITDA of SEK 10,655 million, SEK 9,236 million and SEK 6,339 million, respectively. In the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, our Adjusted Cash EBITDA increased to SEK 11,013 million compared to SEK 9,632 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019. In the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we maintained an EBITDA margin of 21%, 36% and 34%, respectively. The decrease in EBITDA margin during the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily a result of a revaluation of the portfolio. In the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, our EBITDA margin decreased to 15% compared to 40% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, with the decrease largely driven by the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially mitigated by our efficiency improvement program and other cost savings initiatives and the resiliency of our platform. See “Summary—Recent Developments—COVID-19.” We believe our results of operations will continue to be positively impacted by our resilient business model, operating leverage and ongoing cost savings initiatives. _Stable cash flows and a unique dataset from the capital light Credit Management Services and Strategic Markets segments_ Our Credit Management Services segment, which requires relatively limited investment, generates stable cash flows and is supported by long-term client relationships. As of June 30, 2020, our Credit Management Services segment managed third-party debt with a combined total collectible value on third-party debt of SEK 205,345 million (€19,593 million equivalent). Furthermore, our Strategic Markets segment benefits from long-term servicing contracts in Greece, Italy and Spain related to carve-out transactions with financial institutions. As of June 30, 2020, our Strategic Markets segment managed third-party debt with a combined total collectible value on third-party debt of SEK 913,144 million (€87,129 million equivalent). We also benefit from system integration with clients associated with the provision of our services, making it unattractive from the client perspective to switch credit management companies. Overall, we tend to experience strong client loyalty and limited attrition. _Significant cash flows embedded in investment portfolios_ As of June 30, 2020, our ERC was SEK 64,674 million (€6,162 million equivalent). We have made significant portfolio investments over the past three years. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we acquired portfolios for SEK 7,324 million, SEK 11,854 million and SEK 7,223 million, respectively.

Key features of our growth strategy include: - _Full client offering providing integrated CMS and financial services solutions. We offer our clients both CMS and financial services solutions, providing them with the full scope of services across the CMS value chain. We believe that our complete value proposition, geographic footprint and scale are highly attractive to existing and potential clients. For example, our Intesa Partnership included entering into a long-term servicing contract and, through a joint venture, the acquisition of an NPL portfolio. Our Piraeus Partnership also included a long-term servicing contract and the acquisition of a leading independent service platform. See “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial _Condition and Result of Operations—Significant factors affecting results of operations—Acquisitions, geographic expansion and divestments.” These transactions demonstrate the breadth of our capabilities_ and the attractiveness of our value proposition to our clients. Furthermore, we see opportunities to increase our share of wallet with existing CMS clients by providing services to them throughout their geographic footprint and service needs. Additionally, our Credit Management Services and Strategic Markets segments provide us with deep insight into the portfolios of our clients and enables us to competitively price portfolios. - _Continued focus on acquisitions of unsecured NPL and expansion of consumer (“B2C”) debt, _secured debt and real estate services. Unsecured consumer NPL sales volumes have remained high_ 115 ----- as banks increasingly prefer to sell their debt to trusted debt collection agencies in order to clean up their balance sheets and focus on their core business. We expect a continued high level of NPL sales, given factors such as the growth in consumer lending and ECB regulation of NPLs. We expect to continue to deploy capital within the unsecured NPL space in order to gain scale in markets where we are not a leader and, to a lesser extent, to opportunistically enter new business areas. We expect to continue to partner with banks on bilaterally agreed large, complex and sensitive transactions, of which our Intesa Partnership and Piraeus Partnership are two recent examples. Additionally, secured NPL transactions have increased in recent years and represent a large portion of the NPL market. In December 2018, we completed the acquisition of 6,400 properties in Spain from Ibercaja, which we hold with a co-investor, bolstering our REO offering and presence in the secured NPL space, and, in April 2019, we completed the acquisition of Solvia, which offers real estate management services in the Spanish market, from Banco Sabadell, which further built out our ability to service Intrum- or third-party-owned secured NPLs. See “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and _Result of Operations—Significant factors affecting results of operations—Acquisitions, geographic expansion and divestments” and “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations—Description of key consolidated income statement line items—Participations in joint ventures.” We expect to continue to strengthen our capabilities with regard to the secured NPL_ markets and RES through greenfield operations and, where relevant, opportunistic acquisitions. We see growth potential from leveraging and exporting the capabilities we have developed with regard to secured markets and RES across many of the geographies in which we operate. - _Co-investments. In our Portfolio Investments segment, we see a pipeline in terms of the number and the size of investment opportunities available, which may outpace our on-balance sheet investment appetite. We consider flexible capital deployment initiatives, such as co-investment structures, which provide us with the ability to acquire larger, mixed portfolios by sharing risk with co-investment partners. Co-investments also increase the breadth of our origination platform by leveraging the network of our co-investment partners. These transactions, in addition to generating revenues from portfolio investments, also act as growth accelerators of third-party debt collection while requiring a lower level of upfront capital investment. - _Geographic expansion. We have a strong track record of expansion into new business areas and expanding our presence within existing markets. We have established operations in 25 countries, including through partnerships and strategic transactions such as carve-outs and bolt-on acquisitions. Our Intesa Partnership established us as a leading player in late payments in Italy, one of Europe’s most attractive markets, and with our Piraeus Partnership we have created the first independent leading credit management platform in Greece. Based on EBA data, our geographic footprint covers 98% of European NPLs, as of December 31, 2019. We continuously assess market conditions, including changes in connection with COVID-19, to ensure we invest prudently and have decided to temporarily reduce our rate of investment and increase the yield requirements on new portfolio investments in order to increase cash flow in the business. Going forward, we will continue to proactively evaluate opportunities to gain market share in existing markets where we currently do not hold leading positions and, to a lesser extent, opportunistically enter new business areas, for example through carve-outs and targeted acquisitions. When entering new business areas, our strategy is typically based on a cautious first entry: we start small and increase our investments as our insight and experience in a particular market increases. Moreover, we often strengthen our local knowledge and databases through business acquisitions and/or carve-out transactions (as we have previously done in the United Kingdom, Spain, Poland, Italy and Greece). For example, one method we employ to enter a new market involves acquiring a company with existing debt servicing capabilities and data, operating the company to develop further knowledge and data capabilities and then leveraging this data and market knowledge to price and purchase debt in the newly entered market. Our investment and pricing strategy is characterized by strict pricing discipline and institutional investment processes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

We continue to implement several initiatives to further drive efficiency and increase our profitability going forward, including: 116 ----- - _Operational integration and portfolio management. We have identified four key operational levers which we continue to execute on: (i) utilization of shared services and scale opportunities, (ii) focus on IT effectiveness and efficiency, (iii) best-in-class sourcing and procurement and (iv) continuing to deploy best practices across our operations to maximize synergy opportunities. We seek to leverage scale and skills advantages and experience in data management, analytics, technology and digitalization to drive collection performance across our segments, seek better pricing and decrease costs and continue to see strong value potential in focusing on active portfolio management. - _Focus on pricing discipline, risk management and compliance. As a result of strict pricing discipline, institutionalized investment processes and operational improvements, from January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2020, on a quarterly basis, we have collected 103 – 115% of our cash flow forecasts. We intend to continue demonstrating a high level of underwriting discipline in order to maintain forecasting accuracy and to ensure that we only acquire portfolios that meet our investment return criteria. In addition, we seek to maintain our competitive advantage through continued early adoption of regulation and best-in-class compliance and risk management procedures. Our resilience throughout the COVID-19 crisis has demonstrated our agility and ability to respond to a rapidly changing hostile economic environment. Going forward this agility has the potential to positively impact our future cost structures. - _Realize operational synergies. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we completed the realization of Merger-related synergies, with realized synergies amounting to SEK 680 million (€65 million equivalent), exceeding the SEK 560 million (€59 million equivalent) expected at the time of the Merger. Realized cost savings related to optimization of operations centers, consolidation of administrative and support functions, harmonization of IT systems and application development and maintenance and increased scale in procurement. We have also capitalized on certain revenue synergies associated with the Merger from the combination of business intelligence operations and data sets, cross-selling of complementary offerings to existing clients, improved cross-border coverage of international clients and transfer of best practices. As part of our continuous efforts to increase our operational efficiency, we continue to identify and target strategic post-Merger efficiency and organizational transformation improvements to positively impact our bottom-line earnings. These additional efficiency programs may include activities such as prioritizing key IT projects, fully integrating newly acquired assets into our existing platform, and streamlining our daily operations and processes to ensure we benefit from the size and scale of our organization and deliver coordinated and seamless service to our clients.

On the Intrum Justitia side, we trace our origins to Sven Göranson founding a credit management services company in 1923 in Sweden. In the aftermath of World War I, as European economies were rebuilding, companies encountered difficulties securing payment from their customers on time, or at all. The companies that Sven Göranson founded became pioneers in developing processes to obtain credit information prior to lending and in specialized collection operations. Following World War II and through the 1960s, Europe experienced economic growth and an upswing in purchasing on credit. During this period, one of the companies founded by Sven Göranson, Justitia Inkasso och Juridiska byrå AB, became Sweden’s premier collection agency. Expanding both organically and through acquisitions, by the 1980s its value proposition included a comprehensive range of services for credit administration, including collection, financial and administrative services and factoring. In 1982, Justitia Inkasso och Juridiska byrå AB changed its name to 117 ----- Intrum Justitia AB (publ). In the years following, Intrum Justitia continued to expand, both through acquisitions and organic growth, to become one of Europe’s leading credit management companies. Lindorff was founded in 1898 in Norway by Eynar Lindorff. From its origins in Norway, it grew to become one of the leading credit management providers in Europe. In October 2014, Nordic Capital acquired 85% of Lindorff and. in mid-2015, Nordic Capital increased its ownership of Lindorff to 91%. Lindorff operated solely in Norway until 1998, after which it expanded into other Nordic and Baltic countries. Subsequently, Lindorff undertook significant European expansion, both organically and through acquisitions. Upon completion of the Merger, we became the leading credit management provider in Europe. Our shares have been listed on Nasdaq Stockholm since June 2002 and have been listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm Large Cap list since January 2014. In the past three years, we have carried out various acquisitions to complement our established operations in addition to the Merger. While historically we focused on investing in unsecured consumer debt, in 2016 we expanded the scope of our investments in purchased receivables to include new asset classes, primarily secured claims, including the acquisition of a large portfolio of consumer loans with real estate collateral from Erste Bank Hungary. In June 2016, Lindorff also completed the acquisition of 85% of Aktua, a servicing company providing primarily secured NPL services and real estate servicing in Spain, with Santander holding the remaining 15%. In April 2017, we completed the acquisitions of Top Factoring SRL, one of the leading portfolio investment companies in Romania, and in December 2017 we acquired CAF, an Italian credit management company with a large and diversified secured and unsecured debt portfolio. In November 2018, we entered into the Intesa Partnership and formed a company, Intrum Italy SpA, of which Intesa is a minority shareholder and to which Intesa contributed its service platform for overdue receivables and we contributed most of our Italian operations at the time. In December 2018, we acquired 6,400 properties in Spain from Ibercaja, which were transferred to a new company in which we were initially the sole majority shareholder, and in which, since February 2019, we have held a majority ownership along with a co-investor, with Ibercaja retaining a minority interest. In April 2019, we completed our acquisition of 80% of the shares of Solvia, which offers real estate management services in the Spanish market, from Banco Sabadell. We have also expanded geographically. In February 2017, we completed the acquisition of Intrum UK, representing our re-entry into the British market, in October 2017, we entered the Greek market by acquiring a debt portfolio from Eurobank and, in July 2018, we expanded into the Brazilian market with the acquisition of a 51% majority shareholding position in the credit management company iPlatform. In October 2019, we strengthened our Greek position and entered into the Piraeus Partnership and acquired 80% of Piraeus Bank’s Recovery Banking Unit in combination with a long-term non-performing exposures servicing agreement, establishing a leading independent credit management platform in Greece. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 80,000 clients and approximately 9,000 employees as well as operations in 25 countries. As of June 30, 2020, Nordic Capital, our largest shareholder, held 47.7% of our shares, with no other shareholder holding 10% or more of our shares. As a condition of the Merger, the EC required us to divest Intrum Justitia’s operations in Norway and Lindorff’s businesses in Denmark, Estonia, Finland and Sweden (the “Divestment”). The Divestment was consummated in March 2018.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

Our comprehensive value proposition combined with our scale supports our ability to develop and maintain strong customer relationships and collect and analyze data to gain further insight into consumer behavior. The depth and breadth of our data assets and analytical capability is key to promoting growth in each component of our business.

Collection services generate the greatest proportion of revenue for this segment. For the year ended December 31, 2019, collection services accounted for 93% of credit management revenue. Our other offerings in the Credit Management Services segment include credit information and optimization services and payment services. _Collection services_ The primary source of revenue for the Credit Management Services segment is the provision of debt collection services to clients when their invoices are past due, with the services being subject to guidelines chosen by the client regarding specific procedures and settlement. As of June 30, 2020, our aggregate total collectible value on third-party debt was SEK 1,118,489 million (€106,576 million equivalent). During the debt collection process we take into account country-specific laws and regulations and we aim in all instances to preserve clients’ reputations. We also undertake the same debt collection processes for our own portfolios. In the initial stages of the debt collection process, we use our Scoring process to estimate the creditworthiness of a group of consumers based on historical data, which allows us to anticipate their payment habits and behaviors. See “Management Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of _Operations—Significant factors affecting results of operations—Collection costs and operational efficiency.”_ Scoring allows us to predict the likelihood that a customer will pay their debts and to tailor our debt collection strategies to collect final payments from customers as efficiently as possible. The process is tailored to account for specific circumstances and behaviors and also to minimize the impact on the customer relationship. Typically, customers are sent a letter stating that we have been instructed to collect the claim on the client’s behalf. If the customer does not pay within a prescribed period, we employ tailor-made strategies aimed at successful collection. 119 ----- Collection methods include telephone calls, letters, text messages, emails and, to some extent, personal visits by agents. Via our online tools for clients, including IntrumWeb, we provide visibility for our clients on the amount a client’s organization is owed and the payment status in real-time. We also provide online tools to customers that allow customers to update their contact information, review their outstanding payments and proceed with payments independently without needing to interact with a customer service representative. Much of our debt collection process is standardized and automated, with the goal of maximizing the total amount collected over the life of the debt through sustainable payment plans or affordable settlements achieved through an amicable and solution-oriented collection approach, rather than exploiting short-term collection potential. We have integrated several automated processes into our debt collection process to improve efficiency and reduce the need for manual case handling. These processes include: - Standardized work processes: a sequence of predefined actions to occur according to a set schedule. Standardized processes determine when our agents should telephone, send a letter, text message or use another means to contact the customer. - Campaigns: the implementation of common processes for a group of claims. Campaigns typically begin when we expect customers to have an enhanced ability to pay. - Event engines: software driven processes that prescribe a series of actions to be taken in connection with 65 different external events, such as customer bankruptcy, death or address modification. For example, these actions could include periodic telephone calls, text messages and other methods typically utilized in the pre-legal collection process. - Automation: the automation of business processes through the use of advanced software, allowing us to carry out processes significantly faster and more efficiently than when done manually, including selecting which customers to contact based on certain criteria and gathering information and business intelligence across channels. We have the ability to provide international collection services to companies engaging in international trade in approximately 180 countries. Depending on the location of the customer, these services are delivered through our network of offices or selected partners. Our partners are selected through a structured on-boarding process and termination plan and are continuously monitored to ensure they meet our code of conduct. If, after the customer has received assistance from us and an opportunity to pay, an amicable collection process is unsuccessful, the matter may be forwarded to legal authorities for a decision. The legal systems vary between countries depending on, for instance, the applicable legislation and the local legal entities responsible for handling cases. We have established locally-adapted processes using highly skilled staff, which may involve third parties such as courts, attorneys and bailiffs where required. _Payment services_ We provide a full suite of services relating to accounts receivable, including invoicing and reminder services. Invoices are distributed automatically and, in circumstances where customers do not pay their bills, we offer reminder services. Using our IT capabilities and Scoring, we are able to send individually-adapted reminders to those who have fallen behind on their payments. Our database of customer payment patterns and trends enables us to adapt the design and frequency of payment reminders to customers’ finances and thereby to help maintain strong client-customer relationships. If a client wishes to send its own invoices, we also offer a tailored account ledger service to support clients in completing transactions with their customers. We further offer VAT specialist services to manage clients’ VAT refund processes, as well as VAT consultancy, registration and compliance services and tailored training packages on how to deal with VAT issues. _Credit information and optimization services_ We provide credit information on individuals and companies across Europe to help our clients determine who to sell to and on what terms. As business is increasingly conducted online, a higher proportion of goods and services are paid for through credit solutions such as invoicing or different installment models. Our integrated services help our clients prevent late or non-payment. We share our insight into existing and prospective consumers’ payment patterns so that clients can make credit decisions about the creditworthiness of their customers on the basis of efficient and reliable information to help ensure a successful transaction for which consumers have the capacity to pay. 120 ----- Our credit risk analysis is based on Scoring, which requires advanced statistical tools and considerable IT capacity. The overall credit risk assessment is derived from a combination of Scoring and an understanding of human behavior, payment patterns and the market. We therefore benefit from our long-term experience with European credit markets and our database of payment patterns in different markets. We also offer a monitoring service pursuant to which we monitor the performance of a client’s credit agreements and detect and alert the client of changes that could affect their credit risk and that may need action. This service helps clients avoid the possibility of non-payment in the future.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

The revenue generated from returns on purchased portfolios is the primary source of revenue for this segment. For the year ended December 31, 2019, revenue from Portfolios Investments accounted for 44% of our total revenue without giving effect to inter-company relations. Our Portfolio Investments business line also houses our REO offering, which includes, either in the course of recovery activities for secured loans (or, infrequently, in relation to unsecured loans with personal guarantees) or as a standalone investment strategy, directly or indirectly and independently or alongside coinvestors, holding title to real estate that we expect to eventually resell. We arrange for the sale of such real estate using internal and external resources and networks. Our real estate exposure within our Portfolio Investment segment is concentrated in Italy, Hungary, Portugal and Spain. Properties are either wholly owned or held by joint ventures in which we participate along with our co-investors. Our properties, including both wholly owned properties and properties held by joint ventures in which we participate along with our co-investors, total to approximately 5,816 properties. The book value of real estate assets in our consolidated balance sheet together with our joint ventures' book value related to properties as of June 30, 2020 was SEK 765 million. _Purchase of overdue receivables_ Following a thorough risk analysis assessment, we acquire portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables for a portion of their nominal value, with the percentage depending on the quality of the debt. Subject to certain exceptions, we service purchased portfolio debt independently using our in-house debt collection function, thereby benefiting from our expertise and economies of scale. We maintain pricing discipline through an institutionalized investment process and a structurally embedded risk management culture and further supported by our data analytics capabilities, which enable us to maintain high portfolio returns and mitigate the risk of overbidding on portfolios. We buy written-off debt from nearly every type and size of company, including credit institutions, private and public enterprises and government bodies, though we focus on acquiring portfolios from known clients. Our provision of CMS, and the complementarity between collection services and debt purchasing, places us in a strong position when seeking to purchase portfolios. In addition to benefiting from advantages related to scale, particularly in relation to data analytics and operational efficiencies, we have a greater understanding of the portfolios being acquired in circumstances where we previously serviced the relevant debt and can therefore assess and price offered portfolios more accurately. We believe our complete value proposition and established relationships make us an attractive bidder for debt portfolios. For the year ended December 31, 2019, 74% of investment in our Portfolio Investments segment were from existing or previous clients. Our core focus has been on portfolios containing consumer unsecured debt and we seek to maintain portfolios that are diversified by country and industry in order to limit overall volatility. We believe that the 121 ----- provision of debt collection services improves our ability to participate in tenders and make sound investment decisions with respect to portfolios of SME receivables. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we invested SEK 1,369 million and SEK 1,736 million, respectively, in forward flow agreements and for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 we invested SEK 852 million and SEK 772 million, respectively, in forward flow arrangements. We believe that forward flow agreements are beneficial as they provide certainty of a minimum volume of claims on which to perform debt collection. Similarly, these agreements are beneficial to the seller as they provide a level of predictability of the volume of claims being sold. _Origination_ The majority of portfolios for sale are currently offered to the market through competitive tender processes, although we also engage our clients in discussions to purchase portfolios through bilateral negotiations whenever opportunities arise. A key driver of our success in debt purchasing has been our ability to leverage our relationships with clients for whom we collect debt through outsourcing contracts. Our local sales teams maintain close relationships with key debt originators in countries where we have local operations. In addition, our senior management maintains close relationships on a cross-border level with our major debt originators and are actively involved in our largest transactions with our major debt originators. Through these relationships, we often receive requests for proposals in relation to the portfolios for sale. _Valuation and due diligence_ We engage in an extensive valuation of any given portfolio in order to determine what price we should offer our client. First, we look at certain characteristics, including the age of the claims in the portfolio, the size of the portfolio, the type of receivable the portfolio contains, the characteristics of collaterals (where applicable) and their connection to the claims and the collection process already undertaken in order to determine whether the portfolio is suitable. Once we have determined that a portfolio is suitable, we engage in an extensive valuation process. Our use of multiple valuation methods takes into account, among other factors, the below analyses: - for the most granular portfolios we conduct (i) vintage analysis, where we use historical cash flow information to forecast future returns, (ii) debt profiles, where we identify and segment portfolios based on the key value drivers in the portfolio and evaluate the total likely recovery for each claim; (iii) scorecards, where we use internal, external and client data to evaluate the likelihood of each customer to pay and to what amount; and (iv) paying books, where we identify different payment profiles and segment accounts based on historic behavior; - for secured loan portfolios or where claims are concentrated in an industry or particular asset class we commission collateral valuations, legal case reviews including court or bankruptcy documentation, servicing notes review including, for example, past or ongoing payment or settlement agreements with debtors and personal guarantor asset or income investigations which either (a) can be reviewed position-by-position by an underwriter and will result in a manual underwriting business plan specific to the position or (b) be captured in a position-by-position model which will augment or correct the seller-provided data with, for example, specific collateral values, liens, legal status, etc. and will calculate position-by-position business plans. Where it is not feasible or reasonable to commission reviews and valuations covering the entirety of a portfolio, we will typically select a composition of the most valuable positions together with a random sample; the results of these reviews and valuations, augmented with the results of the aforementioned exercises, will be fed into extrapolation models that will help adjust inputs and assumptions for the positions that could not be reviewed. As a final validation step, the investment and operations team organize sessions during which the business plan for a selection of positions is reviewed against their inputs. The emphasis we place on each valuation method depends on the specific circumstances, information available and characteristics of the portfolio for sale. In conjunction with the valuation process, we also perform due diligence on the portfolio prior to making a final bid. The purpose of this due diligence process is to identify any areas of risk that would impact our ability to successfully manage the portfolio following its purchase. As part of the due diligence process, we request and work to verify certain data fields, including claim balances, payment history on claims, details of credit agreements and legal enforceability. Additionally, we undertake a detailed review of the assumptions underlying the valuation process and determine whether the assumptions should be adjusted. For certain transactions, we also engage 122 ----- external advisors for this process. We seek to leverage our relationships with clients to assist us with this process by obtaining guidance on pricing, where possible. We believe that we have a competitive advantage when we are invited to bid on a portfolio for which we already perform debt collection because we are able to accurately assess the potential uplift that can be generated given our familiarity with the debt collection measures that have already been undertaken, allowing us to accurately price the portfolio. This results in being able to confidently offer an attractive value proposition to clients, which makes us a strong contender for portfolios that we find attractive. _Offer_ Depending on the size of the transaction, the assessment and final pricing of a portfolio involves input from our country-level management and operations, our debt purchasing and debt collection teams, our IT team and senior executives. This group works together to use the information gathered in the process to prepare the final bid, and the relevant country team uses its knowledge and expertise to provide a current and accurate reflection of the competitive environment in order to ensure that the final bid is competitive. The final bid is determined based on an analysis of various scenarios, which are designed to test our models at the high and low ends of prior experience, and is evaluated and approved by pre-defined levels of management based on the size of the bid. The final price that we offer for a portfolio takes into account the return that we require to compensate for the risk present in the transaction, the possibility that actual performance of the portfolio may deviate from the expected performance and the level of competition that we face in the market. We believe that a key driver of our success in debt purchasing is due to our ability to leverage our relationships with clients. We use these relationships to engage in a dialogue with the client in order to help us putting together a competitive bid. These relationships can also be used to propose alternative structures if we believe it will create value for us and the client. We also frequently receive a “first and last look opportunity” at a portfolio due to these pre-existing relationships. _Contract and closing_ For the majority of our portfolio purchases, clients receive a one-off cash payment. However, we also offer different pricing models in an effort to address specific needs or desires of our clients. One such alternative pricing model is a profit sharing “earn-out model” in which the client receives an upfront cash payment for the portfolio based on an initial forecast and then receives a percentage of any gains above the initial forecast. _Implementation_ After purchasing a portfolio, if we do not already perform debt collection on the purchased portfolio, we must ensure that claim balances are accurately recorded, funds paid between the determination date and the closing date by customers are received and customers are diverted to the appropriate phase of the collection process. We also screen individual claims against various databases to determine whether any of the claims do not meet the specified criteria and should be returned, if contractually permitted. If we already service the purchased portfolio, the risks associated with the conversion process are minimized as many of these steps have already been undertaken as part of our debt collection services. _Contact and collection process_ After acquiring a portfolio, we typically manage the portfolio in-house. Our deep knowledge of the debt collection process enables us to create customized approaches for each customer and to determine whether we can extract additional value from a customer and uplift on a portfolio by applying different collection methods. By servicing purchased portfolios in-house, we also provide stability and scale to the debt collection segment of our business, which allows us to improve and enhance our debt collection methods.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

Each of these services helps to ensure that our clients are paid and their customers become debt-free. 123 ----- We believe that our extensive data assets and analytical capabilities enable us to proactively assess portfolios. Companies that only purchase portfolios typically have less data on customers and associated payment trends until a portfolio is purchased, when the specific customers in the portfolio can be matched to a credit referencing agency database. In addition, customer files in a portfolio may contain inaccurate or incomplete information on the name, address or telephone number of the customer, which can make it difficult to locate the customer or can otherwise complicate the debt collection process.

In June 2020, we received a draft decision from the Swedish tax authorities who increased our taxable income for the year ended December 31, 2018 by SEK 4.5 billion (€438 million equivalent) resulting in an estimated cash tax SEK 760 million (€74 million equivalent) due and payable during the fourth quarter 2020. The increase represents the accumulated difference in amortization at December 31, 2018. Due to the accrual of deferred tax liabilities, representing the difference, the decision by the Swedish tax authorities will result in a reclassification from deferred tax to current tax. This reclassification is estimated to have very limited, if any, impact on our consolidated income statement.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

Since 1998, we have conducted an annual study of business outlook and payment behaviors in Europe, which we disseminate through the European Payment Report. Since 2013, we have conducted an annual study of European consumers’ ability to manage household finances which is outlined in the European Consumer Payment Report. These annual reports provide information on the effects of late payments on companies and consumers across Europe. The European Payment Report 2020 indicates that businesses are facing unparalleled uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic. One in two companies reported that late payments reduce their liquidity during the 126 ----- COVID-19 pandemic and seven in ten companies accept unfavorable payment terms in order to secure credit and maintain cash flow. As a consequence, the European Payment Report 2020 indicates that approximately fifty percent of European companies support initiatives to prevent late payments from corporations and new legislation. Data from these reports is used by clients, decision-makers at the EU and at local levels as well as by the media. Since 2013, as the representative of the business community, we have spoken publically about the consequences within the EU of late payments based on the insights from the annual reports. We continue to participate in dialogue with the EC on how to make the implementation of the Late Payment Directive as effective and impactful as possible. We have also undertaken a number of initiatives at the local level. In 2016, we launched Spendido in Sweden, an interactive web lesson on household economy, with a focus on credit. The lesson constitutes a tool for high school teachers to illuminate the consequences of buying on credit. Within this framework, our employees hold lessons in upper secondary school classes about what buying on credit entails, what the cost is when someone fails to pay and what happens once an invoice has been passed on for debt collection.

When credit assessments and payment flows function as they should, companies are paid. This allows companies to be more profitable, to develop, to grow and to recruit more employees. At the same time, we help people become debt-free and to achieve sound private finances. It is in helping others achieve a sound economic situation, which in turn is a fundamental element of society’s overall sustainability efforts, that we can make our greatest impact. We have taken a number of concrete steps toward this goal. For example, over the years we have taken an active role in policy development by frequent lobbying in Brussels. Additionally, since 1998, we have conducted Europe’s largest survey on payment habits and commissioned written reports thereon. The survey results demonstrate the need for countries, governments, businesses and consumers to establish efficient payment flows throughout Europe. In general, we endeavor to improve consumer skills in private finance by helping consumers understand the importance of spending responsibly and the risks associated with high indebtedness. We are committed to providing the greatest possible benefits for clients through offering a comprehensive range of services. We have developed three general focal points that drive our sustainability and social responsibility efforts moving forward: (i) enabling sustainable payments, (ii) being a trusted and respected industry actor and (iii) growing by making a difference. - _Enabling sustainable payments._ We believe that by ensuring our interactions with clients and the services that we provide to customers are founded upon our four core values of empathy, ethics, dedication and solutions, we can, as a market leader, influence the development of the credit management industry in an ethical and sustainable direction, in turn enabling sustainable payment flows through which our clients receive payments and customers become debt free. - _Being a trusted and respected industry actor. We believe that the integration of good business ethics throughout our operations and value chain is key to being a trusted and respected actor within the industry. Following the Merger, we consolidated the Intrum Justitia and Lindorff internal regulations to form our new Code of Conduct. A key facet of being a trusted and respected actor, which is reflected in our Code of Conduct, is our commitment to conducting our business and treating all of our customers with respect and consideration. We have rolled out a program in which each of our employees will receive a Code of Conduct training and the program is well underway. Through our environmental instructions, in connection with our Code of Conduct, we work to reduce our environmental and climate impact and we further endeavor to protect the personal data of the individuals with whom we deal by handling sensitive information in a manner that guarantees their personal integrity is respected, enabling a sustainable future for coming generations. - _Growing by making a difference._ We strive to be the most attractive employer in the sector by offering meaningful and stimulating work with strong opportunities to develop, grow and make a difference in the communities in which our employees work. It is important to us that all of our employees are treated respectfully and are afforded equal opportunities for development.

Instead, each country has developed its own set of rules for debt collection operations. The regulations cover, among other things: the methods by which claims can be assigned or transferred; the ways in which a customer can be contacted and a debt collected; and the types and level of fees, interests and costs that can be imposed, and whether those fees, interests and costs can be passed to the customer or the client. In countries where there are no specific regulations covering debt collection and where no licensing requirements apply for certain debt collection operations, there are still regulations of a more general nature which we must observe when carrying out our debt collection operations. Such regulations include, for example, general civil and commercial rules and consumer protection laws and regulations regarding caps on collection fees and interest costs. In addition, in a number of markets in which we operate, the reimbursement of costs for debt collection is limited by law. Any regulatory changes reducing the amount of such costs we can recover may have a negative impact on our results of operations. Note that in Norway amendments to the Debt Collection Regulation have been adopted and will take effect from October 1, 2020, which will reduce the amount of debt collection costs that can be claimed from debtors. In Finland, the supervising authority has objected to Intrum’s practice of combining collection fees of several collection cases into one case where Intrum is the creditor. We are considering appealing this decision in the Administrative Court of Helsinki on the basis that, in our opinion, the current business model is more beneficial for our end customers. However, should the decision stand, Intrum Finland may be required to change its business model with respect to debt surveillance and collection practices. While it is not possible to estimate when this matter may be resolved, in particular if there is an appeal, Intrum Finland has begun to assess and discuss alternative business models for debt surveillance collection processes with the supervising authority. In many of the countries in which our operations are licensed or regulated, our subsidiaries are subject to certain integrity tests with respect to debt collection. These integrity tests may include verifying that: the collection business is carried out in accordance with local rules and regulations; consumer lending operations are conducted in accordance with sound lending practices; the directors of the board have sufficient knowledge and experience and have not misused any debt collection permissions; and the directors meet other general suitability and reliability checks.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

In a majority of the countries in which we operate, it is possible to extend the statutes of limitation on historic debt claims indefinitely by using various methods, including enforcement actions, notification of the customer or otherwise interrupting the limitation period with continued court proceedings. Some of the countries in which we operate have in recent years changed the statutes of limitation for certain debt including by limiting the ability to extend or interrupt the limitation period, or have discussed doing so. We constantly monitor any 128 ----- changes in these rules in the countries in which we operate, and, where appropriate, implement local procedures to interrupt the limitations period. Any significant reduction in the statute of limitations or in the ability to toll the statute of limitations, and any failure to implement local procedures to interrupt the limitations periods, would negatively impact our operations.

151,Final Offerings 2020.md,900,REGULATORY OVERVIEW,900.1,Regulation of the credit management industry,900.1.3,Enhanced consumer protection,"There has been a trend in recent years to afford more protection to consumers. Various laws, regulations and judicial decisions in jurisdictions in which we operate have changed the way we operate and some have negatively impacted our financial condition. For example, a few countries have proposed giving bailiffs the right to provide services in the pre-legal market, including the right to purchase debts and perform voluntary collections. We are currently assessing the impact of these proposals on the relevant subsidiaries and are closely involved in the legislative processes. Consumer protection laws can limit our ability to enforce debt claims. For example, in Finland, the enforcement of a consumer debt claim in the event of a default by the customer is subject to restrictions, such as a minimum period of time having passed as the payment due date and a minimum proportion of the debt remaining outstanding. Further, enforcement is prohibited if the payment default of the consumer customer is due to social force majeure, such as illness or unemployment, or other circumstance beyond the customer’s control, unless it would be perceptibly unreasonable to the creditor in the circumstances. Similar laws exist in other jurisdictions in which we operate. Certain countries in which we have operations have taken steps to facilitate debt restructuring by individuals, whereby a payment plan for all outstanding indebtedness is initiated. After making all payments pursuant the payment plan, the customer is no longer liable to pay any of the debt included in the debt reconstruction. In Sweden, a new Debt Reconstruction Act (Sw. Skuldsaneringslag 2016:675) came into effect on November 1, 2016, under which eligible customers are allowed a payment plan shorter than the normal five years. In Norway, a debt reconstruction may involve either a delay in payment of all or part of a debt; the creditors waiving, in whole or in part, their claims on interest or fees; and/or the customer no longer being liable to pay the debt after a particular period of time. Other jurisdictions have taken measures to impose moratoriums on collections procedures under certain conditions or offer other collections solutions to those in debt. In 2013, the Spanish Act for the Support of Entrepreneurs introduced an out-of-court payment arrangement proceeding (Sp. acuerdo extrajudicial de pagos) in the Spanish Insolvency Act, available to natural and legal persons meeting certain requirements (such as having liabilities which do not exceed €5 million and having sufficient assets to meet the expenses of the out-of-court payment arrangement). A customer unable to meet its payment obligations may apply for this procedure and a mediator will be appointed. Among other things, the opening of the out-of-court payment arrangement procedure will stay enforcement of claims over assets of the debtor for a maximum of three months, except under certain circumstances, and suspend the accrual of interest during the negotiation period and for a maximum of three months. Payment agreements may include the assignment of certain assets of the debtor for payment of the debt, a reduction of debt, moratoriums of up to ten years or a conversion of debt into equity or into profit participative loans with a term of up to ten years. Creditors may suggest changes to the proposed agreement, which is subject to a majority vote by creditors and may therefore be imposed on dissenting unsecured creditors. If the out-of-court procedure does not succeed, the mediator must immediately file for the customer’s insolvency and will be appointed as the insolvency administrator. In the Netherlands, a so-called ‘broad moratorium’ came recently into force that provides for a temporary cooling off period for the customer to achieve a more stable financial situation. Customers may also become subject to insolvency proceedings which may result in a delay or prevention in the enforcement of the claims transferred to us, including reductions in principal or interest. Collection of unsecured claims in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency is generally limited by means of the funds available for distribution from the insolvent estate.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

Other countries have targeted particular types of consumer credit agreements. In the Netherlands, a Supreme Court ruling in June 2014 held that telecom consumers party to an 129 ----- agreement in which a “free” phone is provided are protected by certain laws and regulations relating to payments by instalments and consumer credit. Another pronounced effect of this enhanced focus on consumer credit has been to increase the scope of which entities must hold a consumer credit license. In reaction to a recent European Court of Justice case, Verein für_ _Konsumenteninformation v INKO, Inkasso GmbH,_ that held debt collection companies were credit intermediaries and thus not required to provide pre-contractual information to consumers, many countries took legislative action to impose a requirement on debt collection companies to register with the local authority or obtain a consumer credit license.

As of May 25, 2018, the processing of personal data by companies established within the EU is governed by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679) (“GDPR”). Similar laws are in place in Norway and Switzerland. Although based on a regulation, the national data protection laws are not identical; therefore slightly different requirements may apply to each of our subsidiaries within the EU. The requirements include that personal data may only be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and may only be processed in a manner consistent with these purposes. Further, personal data must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which it is collected and/or processed and it must not be kept for a longer period of time than necessary for the purposes of the collection. In several jurisdictions, however, the local anti-money laundering legislation requires that the financial undertakings store data obtained in relation to customer due diligence for five years after the closure of a customer relationship or five years after a transaction has been executed, regardless of whether the storage is considered necessary. We are also subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in each country where we operate. To comply with regulatory requirements, we have established data protection processes, including having in place data protection policies, information security policies, data retention policies and procedures for handling data subject requests. Furthermore, many jurisdictions in which we operate require that we acquire a license from, or register with, the local data protection authority. The GDPR contains several opening clauses, whereby EU Member States may enact specific national rules in specified areas. In Sweden, national rules have been implemented in the Swedish Act on Supplementary Provisions to the EU Data Protection Regulation (Sw. Lag (2018:218) med kompletterande bestämmelser till EU:s _dataskyddsförordning) (the “Act”). The Act contains provisions regarding, inter alia, the processing of certain_ categories of personal data. In addition to the Act, the Swedish Regulation regarding Supplementary Provisions to the EU Data Protection Regulation (Sw. Förordning (2018:219) med kompletterande bestämmelser till EU:s _dataskyddsförordning) (the “Regulation”) is applicable. The Regulation stipulates, inter alia, that the Swedish_ Data Protection Authority is the supervisory authority under the GDPR and the Act. It is not yet fully clear how the EU Member States in which we operate will make use of these opening clauses, and how this might affect our business. We expect the data protection policies of our entities outside of the EU to largely be in line with the GDPR by the time of its entry into force. Norway has already directly implemented the GDPR through the Norwegian Act of Data Protection of 2018. The Act also contains certain national provisions regarding, _inter alia, the processing of certain categories of personal data. In Switzerland, legislation is being considered that would update data protection law to be more consistent with EU law. In the 130 ----- U.K., it is not yet clear what impact the announced exit from the EU will have on our data protection responsibilities, including with respect to length of time such data may be retained, whether such data must stay within the U.K. and how transfers of personal data to and from the U.K. will be protected. However, all of our entities, including any in the U.K., will be included in the our Company-wide GDPR Program, as further described below, to ensure the data protection policies across all of our entities are harmonious. The GDPR significantly changes the EU data protection landscape, including strengthening of individuals’ rights, stricter requirements on companies processing personal data and stricter sanctions with administrative fines up to €20 million or, in the case of undertakings, 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. GDPR also offers data subjects the option to let a privacy organization litigate on their behalf, including collecting the potential damages. We have established a data protection project team, with representatives from the compliance, IT, operations and legal departments, and on March 22, 2019, we adopted a new data privacy policy to ensure compliance with the GDPR.

The 4th AML Directive enhances the current client due diligence requirements and also imposes stricter sanctions with administrative fines of at least €5,000,000 or 10% of total annual turnover. The 4th AML directive directs all EU Member States to transpose the directive into local law by June 2017. To ensure compliance with the 4th AML directive, we have established a specifically-designed initiative, the AML Project, and appointed a group AML officer to monitor transposition of the 4th AML Directive, coordinate implementation of required solutions for new client due diligence measures and ensure ongoing monitoring of clients and their transactions.

In some jurisdictions, purchasing performing mortgages portfolios could trigger certain requirements, such as having to obtain a credit license, comply with AML measures or maintain a certain level of civil liability insurance. Many countries specifically regulate the assignment of debt claims to other parties. For example, in Norway, loans and credits granted by financial institutions can only be assigned without consent of the debtor to other financial institutions. Further, the transfer of a loan portfolio is subject to the Norwegian regulator’s consent if the portfolio is of significance for any of the involved entities.

If any Payor becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any Note or Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date).

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Principal Paying Agents an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Principal Paying Agents the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer. If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee or the Registrar as applicable will promptly authenticate (or cause to be authenticated) and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Note equal in aggregate principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in an aggregate principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Securities Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notices on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control, or an offer or other transaction that if consummated would result in a Change of Control has been publicly announced and, if applicable, not withdrawn, at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. 194 ----- The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which the Notes are then listed) in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict. Under the RCF Facility Agreement and the Backstop RCF Agreement, the occurrence of a change of control would require the repayment of such indebtedness, and under the Existing Indentures, the occurrence of a change of control would require the Issuer to make an offer to holders of the Existing Notes to repurchase the Existing Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof. Future debt of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may contain similar requirements, or may prohibit the Issuer from purchasing Notes in the event of a Change of Control or provide that a Change of Control is a default. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to purchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, other debt, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of the purchase on the Issuer. The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited to the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes—We may _not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the Indenture.”_ Holders may not be entitled to require the Issuer to purchase their Notes in certain circumstances involving a significant change in the composition of the Issuer’s board of directors, including in connection with a proxy contest. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is limited case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes under the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant: (1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant; (2) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date under the RCF Facility Agreement and the Backstop RCF Agreement shall be deemed Incurred on the Issue Date under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the description of this covenant and not the first paragraph or clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the description of this covenant; (3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments or any “parallel debt” obligation relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included; (4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7), (11), (12) or (15) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included; (5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof; (6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; (7) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS; (8) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred under this covenant in reliance on a percentage of ERC or Total Assets at the time of Incurrence, such percentage of ERC or Total Assets restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus premiums (including tender premiums), costs and fees in connection with such refinancing; and 198 ----- (9) for the purpose of determining compliance with clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant, ERC shall be measured at the option of the Issuer on (i) the most recent date on which new commitments with respect to such Indebtedness are obtained or (ii) the date on which such Indebtedness is Incurred; and shall be the ERC as of the most recent balance sheet date for which internal ERC calculations are available. Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be calculated as specified under the definition of “Indebtedness.” If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date. For purposes of determining compliance with any euro- or SEK-denominated (as applicable) restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness (including any Indebtedness to be Incurred under the first paragraph of this covenant or by reference to a percentage of ERC or Total Assets) or for purposes of calculating the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or Consolidated Leverage Ratio for any other purpose under the Indenture, in each applicable case, the euro or SEK equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness or, at the option of the Issuer, first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower euro or SEK equivalent, as applicable), in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro or SEK, as applicable, and such refinancing would cause the applicable ratio or euro- or SEK-denominated restriction, as applicable, to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such ratio or euro- or SEK-denominated restriction, as applicable, shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the aggregate principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, premiums (including tender premiums) and other costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing; (b) subject to clause (c) below, the euro or SEK equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if and for so long as any such Indebtedness is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in which such Indebtedness is denominated covering all or any portion the principal and interest on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro or SEK, as applicable, will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor (if any) will incur any Indebtedness (including any Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the second paragraph of this covenant) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any such Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and the applicable Guarantee thereof on substantially identical terms (as determined in good faith by the Issuer); _provided,_ however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured, by virtue of being secured with different collateral, by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis, by virtue of being guaranteed by different obligors or by virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment-ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness under Credit Facilities. 199 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

The operations and procedures of the settlement system are controlled by the settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither the Issuer nor any of the Initial Purchasers is responsible for those operations or procedures. The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can act only on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

This discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. holder (as defined below), except for the discussion of FATCA (as defined under “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act”), and does not address the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. This discussion is based upon the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder (the “Treasury Regulations”), and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or that any such position would not be sustained. This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the unearned income Medicare contribution tax or the alternative minimum tax, or to holders subject to special rules, such as certain financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt entities, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass through entities and investors in such entities, persons that are tendering any notes in the Redemption, persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an “applicable financial statement” (as defined in Section 451 of the Code), U.S. holders that are resident in or have a permanent establishment in a jurisdiction outside the United States, U.S. holders that hold Notes through non-U.S. brokers or other non-U.S. intermediaries and persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other integrated transaction. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase Notes for cash pursuant to this Offering at their “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of Notes is sold to the public for cash, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and who hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code. For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any entity taxable as a corporation that is created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) any estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) any trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person. If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the U.S. tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partnership considering an investment in the Notes, and partners in such a partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

Our position is uncertain and is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS successfully takes a contrary position, U.S. holders would generally be required to treat any gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of the notes as ordinary income rather than as capital gain. Furthermore, U.S. holders would be required to accrue 260 ----- interest income on a constant yield determined at the time of issuance of the notes, with adjustments to such accruals when any contingent payments are made that differ from the payments calculated based on the assumed yield.

A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that receives a payment of stated interest on the Notes will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency interest payment (determined based on the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time. A cash method U.S. holder will not recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such stated interest, but may recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the foreign currency so received. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or who is otherwise required to accrue interest prior to receipt, will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the amount of stated interest income in foreign currency that has accrued for such year determined by translating such amount into U.S. dollars at the average spot rate of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate of exchange for the partial period within each taxable year. Alternatively, an accrual basis U.S. holder may make an election (which must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the electing U.S. holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. holder, and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS) to translate accrued interest income into U.S. dollars using the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the interest accrual period (or the last day of the portion of the accrual period within each taxable year in the case of a partial accrual period), or at the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt, if that date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued stated interest income on the date such interest is received. The amount of foreign currency exchange gain or loss recognized will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency payment received (determined based on the spot rate of exchange on the date such stated interest is received) in respect of such accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income that has accrued during such accrual period (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time. Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated, for foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss, and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

In such event, U.S. holders generally will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) for U.S. federal income tax purposes on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. holders generally will include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. The Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds their issue price (as defined above) by an amount equal to or greater than a statutorily defined _de minimis_ amount (generally, 0.0025 multiplied by the stated principal amount and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date). In the event that the Notes are issued with OID, the amount of OID with respect to a Note includible in income by a U.S. holder is the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in which such U.S. holder holds such Note. A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The accrual period of a Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that 261 ----- each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of such accrual period and its “yield to maturity,” determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of stated interest allocable to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note at the start of any accrual period is equal to its issue price, increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period and decreased by the amount of any payments previously made on the Notes that were not stated interest payments. The yield to maturity of a Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all principal and interest payments to be made under the Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the Note. OID, if any, on the Notes will be determined for any accrual period in foreign currency and then translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described above in the third paragraph under “—Payments and accruals of stated interest.” A U.S. holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the disposition of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency payment received, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. For these purposes, all receipts on a Note will be viewed first, as payment of stated interest payable on the Note; second, as receipt of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and third, as receipt of principal. The rules governing OID instruments are complex and prospective purchasers should consult their own tax advisors concerning the application of such rules to the Notes as well as the interplay between the application of the OID rules and the currency exchange gain or loss rules.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will, in general, be the cost of such Note to such U.S. holder, decreased by payments on the Note other than stated interest and increased by any OID previously accrued by such U.S. holder with respect to such Note. The cost of a Note purchased with foreign currency generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price on the date of purchase, calculated at the exchange rate in effect on that date. If the Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and, if it elects, an accrual basis taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of the Note by translating the amount paid at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase. If a U.S. holder receives foreign currency on such a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of taxable disposition. In the case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder (and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder) will determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency by translating such amount at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the disposition. The special election available to accrual basis U.S. holders in regard to the purchase and disposition of Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. holder from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss. Gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Note generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss. Gain or loss attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of a Note generally will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Note, determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition, and the U.S. 262 ----- dollar value of the U.S. holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Note, determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date the U.S. holder purchased the Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder may recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest and accrued OID, if any, which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of stated interest” or “—Original Issue Discount,” as applicable. However, upon a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder will recognize any foreign currency exchange gain or loss (including with respect to accrued and unpaid interest and OID, if any) only to the extent of total gain or loss realized by such U.S. holder on such disposition. Any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note in excess of foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to such disposition generally will be U.S. source gain or loss and generally will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) derived in respect of capital assets held for more than one year are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding how to account for payments made in a foreign currency with respect to the acquisition, sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note and the foreign currency received upon a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

Under proposed Treasury Regulations, any withholding on foreign passthru payments on Notes that are not otherwise grandfathered would apply to passthru payments made on or after the date that is two years after the date of publication in the Federal Register of applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments. Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed regulations until final Treasury Regulations are issued. Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable final Treasury Regulations defining foreign passthru payments are published in the Federal Register generally would be “grandfathered” unless materially modified after such date. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA could apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering period. Non-U.S. governments have entered into agreements with the United States (and additional non-U.S. governments are expected to enter into such agreements) to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein. Holders should consult their own tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes.

151,Final Offerings 2020.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.53,Swedish tax considerations,21.53.1,,"The following summary outlines certain Swedish tax consequences relating to holders of Notes. The summary is based on the laws of Sweden as currently in effect and is intended to provide general information only. The summary does not address, inter alia, situations where Notes are held in an investment savings account (Sw. investeringssparkonto), the tax consequences of a write-down or conversion of the Notes, the existence of the ability of relevant regulatory authorities to effect such a write-down or conversion, any tax consequences following a variation or substitution (instead of redemption) of any Notes or the rules regarding reporting obligations for, among others, payers of interest. Further, the summary does not address credit of foreign taxes in Sweden. Investors should consult a professional tax adviser regarding the Swedish tax and other tax consequences (including the applicability and effect of tax treaties for the avoidance of double taxation) of acquiring, owning and disposing of Notes in their particular circumstances. _Holders not tax resident in Sweden_ Payments of any principal or any amount that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes to the holder of any Notes should not be subject to Swedish income tax, provided that such a holder (i) is not a resident of Sweden for Swedish tax purposes and (ii) does not have a permanent establishment in Sweden with which the Notes are effectively connected. However, broadly speaking, provided that the Notes are deemed to be securities taxed as shares, private individuals who have been residents of Sweden for tax purposes due to a habitual abode or continuous stay in Sweden at any time during the calendar year of disposal or redemption or the ten calendar years preceding the year of disposal or redemption, are liable for capital gains taxation in Sweden upon disposal or redemption of such Notes. In a number of cases though, the applicability of this rule is limited by the applicable tax treaty for the avoidance of double taxation. Swedish withholding tax, or Swedish tax deduction, is not imposed on payments of any principal or any amount that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes except in relation to certain payments of interest (and other distributions on Notes) to a private individual (or the estate of a deceased individual) who is (or was) resident in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes (see “Holders tax resident in Sweden” below). 264 ----- _Holders tax resident in Sweden_ In general, for Swedish corporations and private individuals (and estates of deceased individuals) with residence in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes, all capital income (for example, income that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes and capital gains on Notes) will be taxable. Specific tax consequences may be applicable to certain categories of corporations, for example life insurance companies. Moreover, specific tax consequences may be applicable if, and to the extent that, a holder of Notes realizes a capital loss on the Notes and to any currency exchange gains or losses. If amounts that are deemed as interest for Swedish tax purposes are paid by a legal entity domiciled in Sweden, including a Swedish branch, or in certain cases a clearing institution within the EEA or the United Kingdom, to a private individual (or an estate of a deceased individual) with residence in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes, Swedish preliminary taxes are normally withheld by the legal entity on such payments. Swedish preliminary taxes should normally also be withheld on other returns on Notes (but not capital gains), if the return is paid out together with such a payment of interest referred to above.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521
151,Final Offerings 2020.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.54,Certain United Kingdom tax considerations,21.54.1,,"The following is a general description of certain U.K. tax consequences relating to the Notes and is based on current U.K. tax law and HM Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) published practice, both of which may be subject to change, possibly with retrospective effect. It does not purport to be a complete analysis of all U.K. tax considerations relating to the Notes, does not purport to constitute legal or tax advice, relates only to persons who are the absolute beneficial owners of Notes and who hold Notes as a capital investment, and does not deal with certain classes of persons (such as brokers or dealers in securities and persons connected with the Issuer) to whom special rules may apply. Prospective noteholders should consult their own tax advisors on the U.K. tax consequences of owning and disposing of the Notes in their particular circumstances. _Stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax (“SDRT”)_ No liability to U.K. stamp duty will arise on the issue of the Notes to holders. If no register of the Notes is maintained in the U.K., (i) U.K. stamp duty will not normally be payable in connection with a transfer of the Notes, provided that any instrument of transfer is executed and retained outside the U.K. and no other action is taken in the U.K. by the transferor or transferee, and (ii) no U.K. SDRT will be payable in respect of the issue of or any agreement to transfer the Notes. In any event, the Notes are expected to fall within an exemption for debt instruments, so there should be no charge to U.K. stamp duty or SDRT for a purchaser on any subsequent transfer of the Notes. _Information reporting_ Information relating to securities and certain cross-border arrangements may be required to be provided to HMRC in certain circumstances. This may include the value of the securities, details of the holders or beneficial owners of the securities (or the persons for whom the securities are held), details of the persons to whom payments derived from the securities are or may be paid and information and documents in connection with transactions relating to the securities. Information may be required to be provided by, amongst others, the holders of the securities, persons by (or via) whom payments derived from the securities are made or who receive (or would be entitled to receive) such payments, persons who effect or are a party to transactions relating to the securities on behalf of others, persons who are a UK intermediary or UK relevant tax payer, as defined in the UK International Tax Enforcement (Disclosable Arrangements) Regulations 2020, where that legislation applies, and certain registrars or administrators.

151,Final Offerings 2020.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.55,CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS General,21.55.1,,"The U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) imposes certain requirements on “employee benefit plans” (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) subject to Title I of ERISA and on entities that are deemed to hold the assets of such plans (collectively, “ERISA Plans”), and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including, but not limited to, the requirement of investment prudence and diversification and the requirement that an ERISA Plan’s investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the plan. Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan (as well as those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts, or entities that are deemed to hold the assets of such plans (together with ERISA Plans, “Plans”)) and certain persons (who are “parties in interest” within the meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, or “disqualified persons” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code) having certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or the Code. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of a Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of a Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation (direct or indirect) to a Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of such Plan. Any Plan fiduciary which proposes to cause a Plan to purchase the Notes should consult with its counsel regarding the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code to such an investment, and to confirm that such purchase and holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any other violation of an applicable requirement of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law (as defined below). Non-U.S. plans, (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), “governmental plans” (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA) and certain “church plans” (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA), while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to non-U.S., state, local or other federal laws or regulations that are substantially similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA and the Code (collectively, “Similar Law”). Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with their counsel before purchasing the Notes to determine the need for, and the availability, if necessary, of any exemptive relief under any such law or regulations. Each Plan should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers or the guarantors or any of their respective affiliates (the “Transaction Parties”) is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or advice based on any particular investment need, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. All communications, correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the Notes are intended to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of the Notes, and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment in the Notes for any specific purchaser. The decision to purchase and hold the Notes must be made solely by each prospective Plan purchaser on an arm’s length basis.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

Such parties in interest or disqualified persons could include, without limitation, the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer Agents or any of their respective affiliates. Depending on the satisfaction of certain conditions which may include the identity of the Plan fiduciary making the decision to acquire or hold the Notes on behalf of a Plan, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA, Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code (which exempt certain transactions between a Plan and non-fiduciary service providers to a Plan) or Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (“PTCE”) 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by an “independent qualified professional asset manager”), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate 266 ----- accounts), PTCE 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 95-60 (relating to investments by insurance company general accounts) or PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions directed by an in-house asset manager) (collectively, the “Class Exemptions”) could provide an exemption from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. However, there can be no assurance that any of these Class Exemptions or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes, or that all of the conditions for any such exemption will be satisfied. Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing the assets of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding (i) are entitled to exemption relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code and are otherwise permissible under all applicable Similar Laws or (ii) would not otherwise constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or any violation of applicable Similar Laws. The foregoing is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive. Each Plan fiduciary (and each fiduciary for non-U.S., governmental or church plans subject to Similar Law) should consult with its legal advisor concerning the potential consequences to the plan under ERISA, the Code or such Similar Laws of an investment in the Notes.

The Purchase Agreement will provide that the Initial Purchasers are obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase all of the Notes, if any are purchased. In the event that an Initial Purchaser fails or refuses to purchase the Notes which it has agreed to purchase, the Purchase Agreement will provide that the purchase commitments of the other Initial Purchasers may be increased up to a specified amount or that the Purchase Agreement may be terminated. The Purchase Agreement will provide that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel. The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. After the initial Offering, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. We have agreed to provide the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees or discounts for their services in connection with the Offering and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses. Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page hereof. The Purchase Agreement will provide that we will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We will agree, subject to certain limited exceptions, not to offer, sell, contract to sell, issue or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuer or any other member of the Group during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date that is 90 days after the date of the Purchase Agreement.

The Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will only offer or sell the Notes: (i) in the United States to QIBs in compliance with Rule 144A; and (ii) outside the United States in offshore transactions to non-U.S. persons in compliance with Regulation S. Until 40 days after the commencement of the Offering, an offer or sale of the Notes within the United States by a broker-dealer (whether or not it is participating in the Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144A. In addition, as Nykredit Bank A/S and Swedbank AB (publ) and their affiliates are not registered with the SEC as U.S. registered broker dealers, they will effect offers and sales of the Notes solely outside of the United States. Nordea Bank Abp’s ability to engage in U.S. securities dealings is limited under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act and it may not underwrite, offer or sell securities that are offered or sold in the United States. Nordea Bank Abp will only underwrite, offer and sell the Notes that are part of its allotment solely outside the United States. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Rule 144A and Regulation S, as applicable.

Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.” One or more Initial Purchasers may make offers or sales of the Notes in the United States through an affiliate or any other U.S. registered broker-dealers pursuant to applicable U.S. securities laws. The Issuer will also agree that it will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities Act or the safe harbor of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes. The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there is currently no market. We have applied for the Notes to be admitted to the Securities Official List of the Exchange, without admission to trading on one of the securities markets operated by the Exchange; however, we cannot assure you that such listing will be obtained, or, if obtained, will be maintained. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market for the Notes as permitted by applicable law after completing the Offering. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act. We cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—There may not be an active _trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_ We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+ 8”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding five business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle in T+8, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing and the next succeeding five business days should consult their own advisors. In connection with the Offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to stabilize the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may also over-allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in market-making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading market for, the Notes.

Accordingly, we are offering and selling the Notes to the Initial Purchasers for re-offer and resale only: - to U.S. investors that we reasonably believe to be QIBs in compliance with Rule 144A; and - outside the United States in offshore transactions to non-U.S. persons in compliance with Regulation S. We use the terms “offshore transaction” and “United States” with the meanings given to them in Regulation S. Each purchaser of Notes, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to and agreed with the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers as follows: (1) It understands and acknowledges that the Notes have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable state securities laws, that the Notes are being offered for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the U.S. Securities Act or any state securities law, including sales in reliance on Rule 144A or Regulation S, and, unless so registered, may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except in compliance with the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable state securities laws, pursuant to an exemption therefrom or in any transaction not subject thereto, and, in each case, in compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) below. (2) It is not an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144) of the Issuer or acting on behalf of the Issuer and it is either: (a) a QIB and is aware that any sale of the Notes to it will be made in reliance on Rule 144A, and the acquisition of Notes will be for its own account or for the account of a party that is a QIB; or (b) a non-U.S. person purchasing the Notes in an offshore transaction in compliance with Regulation S. (3) It acknowledges that none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Principal Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Initial Purchasers, or any person representing any of them, have made any representation to it with respect to the offering or sale of the Notes, other than the information contained in this Offering Memorandum which has been delivered to it and upon which it is relying in making its investment decision with respect to the Notes. It has had access to such financial and other information concerning the Issuer and its subsidiaries and the Notes as it has deemed necessary in connection with its decision to purchase any of the Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of, and request information from, the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers. (4) It is purchasing the Notes for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which it is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the U.S. Securities Act or any state securities laws, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and subject to its or their ability to resell such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other exemption from registration available under the U.S. Securities Act. (5) It agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is purchasing the Notes, as applicable, and each subsequent holder of the Notes by its acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Notes prior to the end of the resale restriction periods described below only: (i) to the Issuer or any subsidiary thereof; (ii) pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared effective under the U.S. Securities Act; (iii) for so long as the Notes are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person it reasonably believes is a QIB who purchases for its own account or for the account of a QIB to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A; (iv) pursuant to offers and sales that occur 271 ----- outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in compliance with Regulation S; or (v) pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and in compliance with any applicable state securities laws, and any applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject to the Issuer’s and the Trustee’s rights prior to any such offer, sale or transfer: (a) pursuant to clause (iv) or (v) to require the delivery of an opinion of counsel, certification and/or other information satisfactory to each of them; and (b) in each of the foregoing cases, to require that a certificate of transfer in the form appearing on the reverse of the security is completed and delivered by the transferor to the Trustee. The foregoing restrictions on resale will not apply subsequent to the Resale Restriction Termination Date (as defined below). The foregoing restrictions on resale will apply (i) in case of Notes sold in reliance on Rule 144A, from the Issue Date until the date that is one year after the later of the Issue Date and the last date that the Issuer or any of its affiliates was the owner of the Notes or (ii) in case of Notes sold in reliance on Regulation S, 40 days after the later of the commencement of this Offering and the closing of this Offering (each, a “Resale Restriction Period”) and will not apply after the applicable Resale Restriction Period ends.

UPON WRITTEN REQUEST, THE ISSUER WILL PROMPTLY MAKE AVAILABLE TO ANY HOLDER OF THIS NOTE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION: (1) THE ISSUE PRICE AND DATE OF THE NOTE, (2) THE AMOUNT OF ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT ON THE NOTE AND (3) THE YIELD TO MATURITY OF THE NOTE. HOLDERS SHOULD CONTACT THE ISSUER AT HESSELMANS TORG 14, NACKA, SE 105 24 STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN, ATTENTION: TREASURER. 273 ----- Each purchaser of the Notes will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions apply to holders of beneficial interests in the Notes, as well as to holders of the Notes. (1) It agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers the Notes notice of any restrictions on transfer of such Notes. (2) It acknowledges that until 40 days after the commencement of the Offering, any offer or sale of the Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A. (3) If it is a non-U.S. person in a sale that occurs outside the United States within the meaning of Regulation S, it acknowledges that until the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period (as defined below), it shall not make any offer or sale of the Notes to a U.S. person or for the account or benefit of a U.S. person within the meaning of Rule 902 of Regulation S. The “Distribution Compliance Period” means the 40-day period following the issue date for the Notes. (4) It acknowledges that the Registrar will not be required to accept for registration or transfer any Notes acquired by it except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to the Issuer and the Registrar that the restrictions set forth therein have been complied with. (5) It acknowledges that the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements and agrees that if any of the acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements deemed to have been made by its purchase of the Notes is no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify the Initial Purchasers. If it is acquiring any Notes as a fiduciary or an agent for one or more investor accounts, it represents that it has sole investment discretion with respect to each such investor account and that it has full power to make the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf of each such investor account. (6) It understands that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would result in a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for such purpose is required. Consequently, any transfer of the Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set forth under “Plan of Distribution.” (7) If it is a purchaser in a sale that occurs outside the United States within the meaning of Regulation S, it acknowledges that until the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, it shall not make any offer or sale of these Notes to a U.S. person or for the account or benefit of a U.S. person within the meaning of Rule 902 under the U.S. Securities Act.

151,Final Offerings 2020.md,903,ENFORCEMENT OF FOREIGN JUDGMENTS AND SERVICE OF PROCESS,903.1,Sweden,903.1.1,,"It is not established by Swedish judicial precedent or otherwise by Swedish law that a power of attorney or a mandate of agency, including the appointment of a service of process agent, can be made irrevocable and therefore any powers of attorney or mandates of agency issued by a Swedish party can be revoked and will terminate by operation of law and without notice at the bankruptcy or temporal demise of the Swedish party giving such powers. The principal rule is that foreign judgments are neither recognized nor enforced in Sweden, unless such judgments pertain to a civil or commercial matter (but not for example bankruptcy) rendered by a court of another EU Member State or member state of the Economic Free Trade Association (“EFTA”), or judgments rendered by a court of another Nordic country. The United States and Sweden do not currently have a convention or treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of court judgments, other than arbitral awards, in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for payment of money rendered by a federal or state court in the United States in civil and commercial matters, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not be directly enforceable, either in whole or in part, in Sweden. In order to enforce any such judgment in Sweden, proceedings must therefore be initiated by way of civil law action on the judgment debt before a court of competent jurisdiction in Sweden, or an administrative tribunal or executive or other public authority of Sweden. Enforcement of any such judgments in Sweden, would not be recognized or enforceable in Sweden as a matter of right without a retrial on its merits (but will be persuasive authority as a matter of evidence before the courts of law, administrative tribunals or executive or other public authorities of Sweden). However, there is Swedish case law to indicate that such judgments: (a) that are based on contract which expressly exclude the jurisdiction of the courts of Sweden; (b) that were rendered under observance of due process of law; (c) against which there lies no further right to appeal; and (d) the recognition of which would not manifestly contravene fundamental principles of the legal order or the public policy of Sweden, should be acknowledged without retrial on its merits. Any legal proceedings in the courts of Sweden will be conducted in Swedish and a court or enforcement authority in Sweden may require, as a further condition for admissibility and/or enforceability the translation into Swedish of any relevant document, and assistance from Swedish authorities in the service of process in connection with foreign proceedings might require the observance of certain procedural and other regulations. Pursuant to the provisions of the 2012 Brussels Regulation, a judgment entered against a company in the courts of a Member State (as defined therein, _i.e._ all EU Member States) and which is enforceable in such a 276 ----- Member State, will be directly enforceable in Sweden upon the satisfaction of the formal requirements of the 2012 Brussels Regulation without any declaration of enforceability being required. It should be noted, however, that a party may apply for refusal of recognition or refusal of enforcement, as applicable, in accordance with the 2012 Brussels Regulation. Such an application shall be submitted to the relevant district court (Sw. tingsrätt) in Sweden. With regard to the provisions of the 2007 Lugano Convention on the Recognition of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters (the “Lugano Convention”), a judgment entered against a company in the courts of a Contracting State (as defined in therein, i.e. all EU Member States and member states of the EFTA other than Liechtenstein (namely Iceland, Switzerland and Norway)) and which is enforceable in such Contracting State, will be directly enforceable in Sweden only upon the satisfaction of the following requirements: (a) that a motion for enforcement has been filed with the relevant district court (Sw. tingsrätt) in Sweden as provided by law and has been granted; (b) that no appeals lie against the judgment entered in the courts of such Contracting State; (c) that the courts of such Contracting State had jurisdiction; (d) that summons has been duly served on the respondent in the proceedings before the courts of such Contracting State; (e) that the judgment is not inconsistent with a prior judgment given between the same parties in the same matter; and (f) that the judgment does not contravene fundamental principles of the legal order or the public policy of Sweden. Judgements which are not within the scope of the 2012 Brussels Regulation or Lugano Convention would, with very limited exceptions, not be recognized or enforced in Sweden without a retrial on the merits. This would for example apply to judgments from United States and other non-EU/EFTA countries. As a result, as the United Kingdom has left the EU, an English court judgement entered against a company incorporated in Sweden may not be recognized or enforceable in Sweden (absent any replacement arrangements being put in place and disregarding that the United Kingdom during a transition period will continue being classified as a Member State for the purposes of the 2012 Brussels Regulation and a Contracting State for the purposes of the Lugano Convention). Swedish courts may award judgments or give awards in currencies other than the local currency, but the judgment debtor has the right under the laws of Sweden to pay the judgment debt (even though denominated in a foreign currency) in the local currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of payment (however, the judgment creditor may, subject to availability of the foreign currency, convert such local currency into the foreign currency after payment and remove such foreign currency from Sweden), and a choice of currency provisions by the parties to an agreement may not be upheld by Swedish courts to constitute a right to refuse payment in Swedish kronor. 277 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

Many of our directors, officers and other executives are neither residents nor citizens of the United States. Furthermore, most of our assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon such persons or us or to enforce against them or us judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws despite the fact that, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, we have appointed, or will appoint, an agent for the service of process in New York. It may be possible for investors to effect service of process within Sweden upon those persons or us or over our subsidiaries provided that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with. If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer, investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the Issuer has assets.

151,Final Offerings 2020.md,51,LEGAL ADVISORS TO THE INITIAL PURCHASERS,51.124,Accounting principles,51.124.1,,"This interim report has been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting for the Group and in accordance with Chapter 9 of the Annual Accounts Act for the Parent Company. In addition to appearing in the financial statements, disclosures in accordance with IAS 34.16A also appear in other parts of the interim report. The accounting principles applied by the Group and the Parent company are substantially unchanged in comparison to the Annual Report 2018, however with the exceptions noted below. The Group applies IFRS 16 Leases as of 2019. See also Note 1 in the 2018 Annual Report. IFRS 16 stipulates that for both financial and operational leases of significance, a right of use asset and a lease liability are to be recognised. Exceptions are short-term leases and leases for assets with a low value, where the leasing cost is recognized on a straight-line basis. The right of use asset is recognised with linear amortisation over the term of the contract. The lease liability is recognised including interest expenses in accordance with the effective interest rate method. The implementation of IFRS 16 entails the recognition of leasing liabilities for leases which were previously classified as operational leases under IAS 17. The liabilities are calculated as the present value of future minimum lease payments discounted at the incremental borrowing rate. Intrum applied the modified retroactive method, meaning that the effect of introducing IFRS 16 was recognised directly against the opening balance without the comparison figures being recalculated. The principal effects on Intrum’s accounting were that the Group’s total assets increased by SEK 709 M, calculated as per the beginning of 2019, with both an asset and a liability being reported for leases in effect (and where the amount is updated monthly), and with operating earnings improving by a preliminary SEK 40 M annually through the implicit interest expense in the leases being reported in net financial items rather than in operating earnings. Intrum has also made a new interpretation of the rules in RFR 2 Accounting legal entities, entailing the Parent Company’s exchange rate differences attributable to the hedging of the Group’s exchange rate risk in foreign operations no longer being reported under Other comprehensive income but under Net financial items in the Parent Company’s income statement. Comparison figures for the preceding year were recalculated in the same way. The amended interpretation with regard to the Parent Company’s accounting has no impact on shareholder’s equity in the Parent Company or on the consolidated financial statements.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

The address of the Company’s headquarters is Hesselmans Torg 14, Nacka, SE- 105 24 Stockholm, Sweden. During 2019, the Company was listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm, Large Cap list. The consolidated accounts were approved for publication by the Company’s Board of Directors on 1 April 2020. The balance sheets and income statements will be presented to the Annual General Meeting on 6 May 2020. The Parent Company’s functional currency is Swedish kronor (SEK), which is also the reporting currency for the Parent Company and for the Group. The financial statements are therefore presented in SEK. All amounts, unless indicated otherwise, are rounded off to the nearest SEK M. The consolidated and annual accounts pertain to 1 January  31 December for income statement items and 31 December for balance sheet items. Accounting standards applied With regard to the consolidated financial statements, the Annual Report for Intrum AB (publ) has been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The Group applies IFRS as adopted by the European Union (EU). For 2018 and 2019, there are no new accounting standards relevant to Intrum in the IFRS issued by the IASB that have not yet been adopted by the EU. This means that the Group’s application of IFRS as adopted by the EU during the year also corresponds to the application of IFRS as issued by the IASB. Further, recommendation RFR 1 Supplementary accounting rules for groups from the Swedish Financial Reporting Board has been applied. The Parent Company applies the same accounting principles as the Group except in the cases stated in the section “Parent Company accounting principles”. Assumptions Assets and liabilities are recognised at historical cost, with the exception of certain financial assets and liabilities, which are measured at fair value. The preparation of financial reports in accordance with IFRS requires the Board of Directors and Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the accounting principles and the carrying values of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and a number of other factors that under current circumstances seem reasonable. The result of these estimates and assumptions is then used to determine the carrying values of assets and liabilities that otherwise are not clearly indicated by other sources. Actual outcomes may deviate from these estimates and assumptions. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed regularly. Changes in estimates are recognised in the period in which the change is made, provided it has affected only this period, or the period the change was made and future periods if the change affects both current and future periods. ----- ##### Estimates made by the Company that have a significant impact on the financial statements and estimates, which could necessitate significant adjustments in financial statements in subsequent years, are described in more detail in Note 36. The accounting principles described below for the Group have been applied consistently for all periods in the Group’s financial statements, unless otherwise indicated. The Group’s accounting principles have been applied consistently in the consolidation of the Parent Company, subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures. Changes in accounting principles Accounting standards that entered into force in 2019 The Group applies IFRS 16 Leases as of 2019. IFRS 16 stipulates that for both financial and operational leases of significance, a right of use asset and a lease liability are to be recognised. The exception is short-term leases and lease agreements for lower-value assets, for which lease fees are expensed on a straight-line basis. The right of use asset is recognised with linear amortisation over the term of the contract or the assessed financial lifetime of the asset, whichever is shorter. The lease liability is recognised including interest expenses in accordance with the effective interest rate method. The introduction of IFRS 16 entails lease liabilities being recognised for lease agreements previously classified as operational leases in accordance with IAS 17. These liabilities are valued at the present value of the future minimum lease payments, discounted at the marginal loan rate. Intrum applied the modified retroactive method, meaning that the effect of introducing IFRS 16 was recognised directly against the opening balance without the comparison figures being recalculated. The principal effects on Intrum’s accounting were that the Group’s total assets increased by SEK 709 M, calculated as per the beginning of 2019, with both an asset and a liability being reported for leases in effect (and where the amount is updated annually), and with operating earnings improving over the first year by SEK 43 M annually through the implicit interest expense in the leases being reported in net financial items rather than in operating earnings. Leases of low value (assets that, in new condition, have a value of less than approximately SEK 50,000) - primarily comprising IT and office equipment - are not included in the leasing debt but continues to be expensed on a straight-line bases over the lease term. Accordingly, the amended accounting relates mainly to rented office premises and cars. Intrum applies IFRIC 23 — Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments, from 1 January 2019. IFRIC 23 requires that a reservation be made, based on a probability assessment, for all tax risks where it is probable that the tax authorities, in the event of a full review, would disagree with the Company’s assessment. In conjunction with the introduction of IFRIC 23, Intrum has increased its provisions for potential tax disputes attributable to intra-Group transactions. The effect is an increase of SEK 155 M in the Group’s income tax liabilities, which is reported directly against the opening balance without the comparison figures being translated. Other changes to IFRS are not expected to have any material effect on the consolidated accounts. Classification issues Fixed assets and long-term liabilities in the Parent Company and the Group consist of amounts that are expected to be recovered or paid more than twelve months after the balance sheet date. Current assets and current liabilities in the Parent Company and the Group consist of amounts that are expected to be recovered or paid within twelve months of the balance sheet date. ----- ##### Consolidation In subsidiaries The Group applies IFRS 3 Business combinations and IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements. The consolidated accounts include the annual accounts of all subsidiaries, i.e., companies in which the Parent Company, directly or indirectly, holds more than 50 percent of the votes or otherwise can exercise control over operations. A controlling interest is achieved when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from, its commitment to the Company and is able to affect returns by means of its decisive influence. An influence arises when the Group has existing rights enabling it to control the relevant operations, that is, the operations that significantly affect the Company’s performance. The consolidated accounts are prepared according to the acquisition method, which means that the acquisition of a subsidiary is treated as a transaction where the Group indirectly acquires the subsidiary’s assets and takes over its liabilities and contingent liabilities. The Group’s equity therefore includes only the portion of the subsidiary’s equity added since acquisition. The Group’s cost is determined through an acquisition analysis in connection with the acquisition. The analysis determines the cost of the shares or operations as well as the fair value of acquired, identifiable assets and assumed liabilities and contingent liabilities. The cost of the subsidiary’s shares or operations consists of the fair value of the compensation on the transfer date and transaction expenses directly attributable to the acquisition. The cost includes conditional purchase considerations recognised as liabilities at fair value per the acquisition date. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. In acquisitions where the cost exceeds the net value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities and contingent liabilities, the difference is reported as goodwill. When the difference is negative, it is recognised directly through profit or loss. Non-controlling interests arise in cases where the acquisition does not relate to the entire subsidiary. There are two options for recognising non-controlling interests. The two options are to recognise the percentage of non-controlling interests that makes up proportional net assets, or to recognise non-controlling interests at fair value, which means that non-controlling interests form a percentage of goodwill. The method used for recognising non-controlling interests is made on a case by case basis. The financial reports of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated accounts from the acquisition date until control ceases. Intra-Group receivables and liabilities, revenue and expenses, and unrealised gains and losses that arise from transactions within the Group are eliminated in their entirety in the consolidated accounts. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associated companies and joint ventures are eliminated to a degree corresponding to the Group’s ownership of those companies. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, to the extent there is an indication of impairment. Associated companies and joint ventures The Group applies IAS 28 Investments in associates and joint ventures, and IFRS 11 Joint arrangements. ----- ##### Associated companies are companies that are not subsidiaries but where the Parent Company, directly or indirectly, has at least 20 percent of the votes or otherwise exercises significant influence without having control over the partly owned company. Participations in associated companies and joint ventures are recognised in the consolidated accounts according to the equity method, which means that the holding in the company is recognised at cost and subsequently adjusted to the Group’s share of the change in the associated company’s net assets. The value of the shares includes goodwill from the acquisition. The consolidated income statement includes the Group’s participation in the company’s earnings less goodwill impairment. The amount is reported under Participations in the earnings of associates and joint ventures. Dividends received from the company are not recognised in the income statement and instead reduce the carrying value of the investment. Any difference between the cost of an acquisition and the owner’s share of the net fair value of the associated company’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised in accordance with IFRS 3. The equity method is applied from the date a significant influence arises until the time it ceases or the associated company becomes a subsidiary. If the Group’s share of reported losses in the company exceeds the carrying value of its participations, the value of those participations is reduced to nil. Losses can also be offset against the Group’s unsecured receivables from the company if they constitute part of the net investment. Further losses are not recognised provided the Group has not issued guarantees to cover them. Joint ventures The Group applies IFRS 11 Joint arrangements. Joint arrangements pertain to companies in which Intrum and other part-owners manage operations jointly in accordance with a shareholder agreement. Joint arrangements classified as joint ventures are reported in the consolidated accounts in accordance with the equity method. Joint ventures are companies in which the Group, through collaborative agreements, shares a controlling interest with one or more parties, such that the Group is entitled to net assets rather than having a direct entitlement to assets and responsibility for liabilities. Jointly owned companies are recognised at cost and subsequently adjusted for the Group’s share of the change in the company’s net assets. The consolidated income statement includes the Group’s share of earnings, and this is reported under Participations in the earnings of associates and joint ventures. Dividends received from joint ventures are not recognised in the income statement and instead reduce the carrying value of the investment. The equity method is applied from the date on which joint control is gained until the date that it ceases or transitions to the sole influence of Intrum. Shared operations, usually conducted in a company format, are joint arrangements in which Intrum and one or more partners are entitled to all of the financial benefits related to the assets of the operations. Shared operations are reported according to the profit split method, meaning that each party to a joint venture reports its share of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Foreign currency The Group applies IAS 21 Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. ----- ##### Transactions in foreign currency Group companies prepare their accounts in the local functional currency in the country where they have their operations. Transactions in a currency other than the local currency are recognised at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction day. When such transactions are offset or settled, the exchange rate may deviate from the one that applied on the transaction day, in which case a (realised) exchange rate difference arises. Moreover, monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are translated at the exchange rates on each balance sheet date, due to which an (unrealised) exchange rate difference arises. Both realised and unrealised exchange rate differences of this type are recognised in the income statement - in the operating result if, for example, they refer to accounts receivable or accounts payable, or in net financial items if they refer to financial investments and borrowing in foreign currency. To avoid exchange rate differences, receivables and liabilities in foreign currency are sometimes hedged through forward exchange contracts. The Group’s holding of forward exchange contracts is marked to market on each balance sheet date, and changes in value are recognised through profit or loss. Translation of the financial statements of foreign operations Assets and liabilities in foreign operations, including goodwill and other Group surplus and deficit values, are translated from the functional currency to the Group’s reporting currency, Swedish kronor, at the exchange rate on balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated at the average rate, which serves as an approximation of the rate that applied on each transaction date. Translation differences arise in the translation of subsidiary accounts in part because the balance sheet date rate changes each period and in part because the average rate deviates from balance sheet date rate. Translation differences are recognised directly in total comprehensive income as the year’s change in the translation reserve. Long-term receivables and liabilities between the Parent Company and subsidiaries can be seen as an extension or reduction of the net investment in each company. If this is the case, translation differences are recognised under other comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements. When foreign operations are sold, accumulated translation differences attributable to those operations are realised. The Group has hedged certain cash flows in a foreign currency by entering into a series of forward exchange contracts. The effects of market valuation of the forward exchange contracts are initially reported in other comprehensive income, but are recognised in operating profit in pace with the reporting of the planned underlying cash flows. Financial assets and liabilities The Group applies IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. A financial instrument is any form of agreement giving rise to a financial asset in a company and a financial liability or equity instrument in a counterparty. Financial instruments recognised in the balance sheet include, on the asset side, cash and bank balances, accounts receivable and other equity instruments, loans receivable, portfolio investments and derivatives. Client funds are recognised on a separate line in the balance sheet and therefore are not included in the Group’s reported liquid assets. Included among liabilities and equity are accounts payable, client funds payable, debt and equity instruments in issue, loan liabilities and derivatives. ----- ##### On initial recognition, financial assets (except accounts receivable with no significant financing component) and financial liabilities are valued at fair value plus (in the case of financial instruments not measured at fair value via the income statement) transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition or issue. Accounts receivable with no significant financing component are valued at the transaction price. On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as valued at amortised cost, fair value via other comprehensive income or at fair value via the income statement. Financial assets are not reclassified after initial recognition, unless the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets, in which case all of the financial assets concerned are reclassified from the first day of the reporting period commencing after the change in business model. A financial asset or financial liability is recognised in the balance sheet when the Company becomes party to the instrument’s contractual terms. Receivables are recognised when the Company has performed and there is a contractual obligation on the counterparty to pay, even if an invoice has not yet been received. Accounts receivable are recognised in the balance sheet when an invoice has been sent. Liabilities are recognised when the counterparty has performed and there is a contractual obligation to pay, even if an invoice has not yet been received. Trade accounts payable are recognised when an invoice is received. A financial asset is removed from the balance sheet when the rights in the agreement are realised, expire or the Company loses control over them. A financial liability is removed from the balance sheet when the obligation in the agreement has been discharged or otherwise extinguished. The fair value of listed financial assets corresponds to their listed market price on the balance sheet date. The fair value of unlisted financial assets is determined by using valuation techniques, e.g., recently conducted transactions, the price of similar instruments and discounted cash flows. For forward exchange contracts and currency interest rate swaps, fair value is determined based on listed prices. The fair value of forward exchange contracts and currency interest rate swaps is calculated by discounting the difference between the contracted forward rate and the forward rate that can be secured on the balance sheet date for the remaining contract period. The current value is obtained by discounting applying the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. For further information, see Note 34. Portfolio investments Portfolio investments consist of portfolios of delinquent receivables purchased at prices significantly below the nominal receivable. Portfolio investments usually refer to receivables from private individuals and are often unsecured receivables. They are reported in accordance with the rules for acquired impaired (“credit-impaired”) receivables in IFRS 9, that is, at amortised cost applying the effective interest method and an effective interest rate reflecting the degree to which the receivable is impaired. The portfolios are attributable to the third stage of credit risk in accordance with the classification in IFRS 9. In the income statement, income from portfolio investments is recognised, in accordance with the effective interest rate method, as the collected amount less amortisation. The collection is often performed by the same personnel who handle collections and debt surveillance on behalf of external clients within the Credit Management service line. The cost of collection is debited internally at market price and expensed in the income statement for the Portfolio Investments service line as a cost of services sold. Reporting follows the effective interest method, where the carrying value of each portfolio corresponds to the present value of all projected future cash flows discounted by an initial effective interest rate determined on the date the portfolio was acquired, based on the relation between cost and the projected future cash flows on the acquisition date. Changes in the carrying value of the portfolios are comprised of amortisation for the period and are recognised ----- ##### in earnings as a deduction item in the calculation of income in accordance with the effective interest method. In connection with the purchase of each portfolio of receivables, a projection is made of the portfolio’s cash flows. Cash flows include the loan amount, reminder fees, collection fees and late interest that, based on a probability assessment, are expected to be received from end customers, less forecast collection costs. With this forecast and the acquisition price including transaction costs as a basis, each portfolio is assigned an initial effective interest rate that is then used to discount cash flows through the life of the portfolio. Current cash flow projections are monitored over the course of the year and updated based on, among other things, achieved collection results, agreements reached with end-customers on instalment plans and macroeconomic information, including forecasts of economic development and unemployment in each country. Cash flow projections are made at the portfolio level, since each portfolio of receivables consists of a small number of homogeneous amounts. On the basis of the updated cash flow projections and initial effective interest rate, a new carrying value for the portfolio is calculated in the closing accounts. The accounting model assumes each portfolio to be relatively homogeneous and comprising a large number of receivables for smaller amounts. Portfolios comprising individual larger receivables, generally receivables with underlying collateral in the form of properties, are valued on acquisition and at the level of the receivables in ongoing reporting over the lifecycle of the portfolio and not at the portfolio level. The Group applies internal application rules which mean that the initial effective interest rate can be adjusted in certain cases without a change in the carrying value of the portfolio for minor projection adjustments within a predetermined interval. Changes over time in the book value can be divided into an anticipated time and interest rate component (amortisation) and a component related to changes in estimates of future cash flows (revaluation). The effects of changes in cash flow forecasts, including changes in the anticipated financial lifetime of the portfolio, are referred to as revaluations and treated symmetrically, i.e., both increases and decreases in forecast flows affect the portfolios’ book value and, as a result, earnings. This means that certain portfolios may be valued at an amount higher than their cost. Although selling portfolios of purchased debt is not included in the business model, when such sales do occur as an exception, the resulting sales price received for the portfolio is reported in the same way as if it had been recovered from the end-customers. The entire remaining carrying values of the portfolios are recognised as amortisation. Long-term receivables and other receivables Long-term receivables and other receivables are those that arise when the Company provides money without the intent to trade its claim. If the anticipated maturity is longer than one year they constitute long-term receivables, and if it is shorter they are other receivables. These receivables are recognised at amortised cost. Accounts receivable Accounts receivable are recognised at the amount expected to be received after deducting impaired receivables, which are determined individually or according to statistical models based on historical experience in each country. Provisions are made for doubtful accounts receivable as the receivables arise, for expected losses, and are, if necessary, adjusted over the term of the claim. The anticipated maturity of accounts receivable is short, so they are carried at amortised cost without discounting. ----- ##### Legal outlays The Group incurs outlays for court fees, legal representation, enforcement authorities, etc., which can be charged to and collected from end-customers. In certain cases Intrum has agreements with its clients where any expenses that cannot be collected from end-customers are instead refunded by the clients. The amount that is expected to be recovered from a solvent counterparty is recognised as an asset in the balance sheet on the line Other receivables. The anticipated maturity of these receivable is short, so they are carried at amortised cost without discounting. Client funds Client funds, which are reported as assets and liabilities in the balance sheet, represent cash received on collection of a specific debt on behalf of a client and payable to the client within a specified period. Client funds are liquid funds with a restricted disposition right. The same amount is reported as a liability. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, as well as immediately available balances with banks and similar institutions. Short-term investments consist of investments with an insignificant risk of fluctuating in value, which can easily be converted to cash and have a maturity of not more than three months from acquisition. Liabilities The Group applies IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. A financial liability is any form of agreement involving a commitment to deliver liquid funds or other financial assets to a counterparty, or that can be resolved by providing an equity instrument. Liabilities are initially recognised at the amount received following deduction of transaction costs. Subsequent to acquisition, loans are carried at amortised cost according to the effective rate method. Long-term liabilities have an anticipated remaining maturity of more than one year, while short-term liabilities have a maturity of less than one year. The Group’s long-term loans generally have short fixed interest periods, which means that the nominal loan amount plus accrued interest is a good approximation of the liability calculated according to the effective rate model. Accounts payable Accounts payable are valued at amortised cost. However, accounts payable have a short anticipated maturity and are carried without being discounting to a nominal amount. Derivative instruments Derivatives consist of forward exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and currency interest rate swaps used to reduce interest and exchange rate risks attributable to assets and liabilities in foreign currency. Derivatives are also contractual terms embedded in other agreements. Embedded derivatives are recognised separately if they are not closely related to the host agreement. Forward exchange contracts are classified as financial assets or liabilities recognised at fair value via the income statement (held for trade) and assessed at fair value without deductions for transaction expenses that may arise on sale or similar. ----- ##### Hedge accounting is not needed for forward exchange contracts because the hedged item and the hedging instrument are carried at the price on the balance sheet date with changes in value recognised in the income statement as exchange rate differences. Changes in the value of operations-related receivables and liabilities are recognised in operating earnings, while changes in the value of financial receivables and liabilities are recognised in net financial items. Currency interest rate swaps are valued at fair value and reported in the balance sheet together with hedge accounting via Other comprehensive income. Currency interest rate swaps may be signed in connection with the Group issuing bonds in one currency that need to be exchanged to another currency to hedge net investments in foreign operations where the loan currency has been used in the operations. Hedge accounting with regard to exchange rate risk in the net investment in foreign subsidiaries Investments in foreign subsidiaries (net assets including goodwill) are to some extent hedged through loans in foreign currency or forward exchange contracts that are translated on the closing date to the exchange rate then in effect. Translation differences for the period on financial instruments used to hedge a net investment in a Group company are recognised in the degree the hedge is effective in total comprehensive income, while cumulative changes are recognised in equity (translation reserve). As a result, translation differences that arise when Group companies are consolidated are neutralised. Property holdings The Group applies IAS 2 Inventories. In connection with acquisitions of portfolio investments and in connection with the recovery of collateral for acquired receivables, Intrum may become owners of property holdings or other physical goods. They have been acquired for the purpose of being divested within the Group’s ongoing operations, and are therefore classified as inventories. These are reported in the balance sheet at cost or net realisable value, whichever is lower. When goods from these inventories are sold, the sales price received is recognised as income and the amount recognised as an inventory asset is reported among expenses for goods and services sold in the same period. Intangible fixed assets Goodwill Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of an acquisition and the fair value of the acquired assets, assumed liabilities and contingent liabilities. If the Group’s cost of the acquired shares in a subsidiary exceeds the market value of the subsidiary’s net assets according to the acquisition analysis, the difference is recognised as Group goodwill. The goodwill that can arise through business combinations implemented through other than a purchase of shares is recognised in the same way. For business combinations where the cost is less than the net value of acquired assets and assumed and contingent liabilities, the difference is recognised directly through profit or loss. Goodwill is recognised at cost less accumulated impairment. The fair value of goodwill is determined annually for each cash-generating unit in relation to the unit’s performance and anticipated future cash flow. If deemed necessary, goodwill is written down on the basis of this ----- ##### evaluation. Intrum’s operations in each geographical region (Northern Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, Western and Southern Europe, as well as the Iberian Peninsula and Latin America) are, in this context, considered to be the Group’s cash-generating units. Goodwill arising from the acquisition of a company with a functional currency other than SEK is recognised as an asset in the functional currency and translated in the accounts at the balance sheet date rate. Capitalised expenditure for IT development The Group applies IAS 38 Intangible Assets. Expenditures for IT development and maintenance are generally expensed as incurred. Expenditures for software development that can be attributed to identifiable assets under the Group’s control and with anticipated future economic benefits are capitalised and recognised as intangible assets. These capitalised costs include staff costs for the development team and other direct and indirect costs. Borrowing costs are included in the cost of qualified fixed assets. Additional expenditures for previously developed software, etc. are recognised as an asset in the balance sheet if they increase the future economic benefits of the specific asset to which they are attributable, e.g., by improving or extending a computer programme’s functionality beyond its original use and estimated useful life. IT development costs that are recognised as intangible assets are amortised using the straight-line method over their useful lives (3-5 years). Useful life is reassessed annually. The asset is recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Costs associated with the maintenance of existing computer software are expensed as incurred. Client relationships Client relationships that are recognised as fixed assets relate to fair value revaluations recognised upon acquisition in accordance with IFRS 3. They are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life (5-10 years). Useful life is reassessed annually. The asset is recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Other intangible fixed assets Other intangible fixed assets relate to other acquired rights are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life (3-5 years). Useful life is reassessed annually. The asset is recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Tangible fixed assets The Group applies IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 40 Investment Property. Tangible fixed assets are recognised at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes the purchase price and costs directly attributable to putting the asset into place and condition to be utilised in the way intended. Examples of directly attributable costs are delivery and handling, installation, consulting services and legal services. Depreciation is booked on a straight-line basis over the asset’s anticipated useful life (3-5 years). Useful life is reassessed annually. Operational properties are properties that have been acquired to be leased to others or used within the Group’s operations rather than being sold. They are reported in accordance with the cost method, applying depreciation over the estimated useful life of the buildings. ----- ##### Additional expenses are capitalised only to the extent that they increase value in relation to performance on the date on which the property was acquired. No depreciation is applied for land. The carrying value of a tangible fixed asset is excluded from the balance sheet when the asset is sold or disposed of or when no economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal of the asset. The gain or loss that arises on the sale or disposal of an asset is comprised of the difference between the sales price and the asset’s carrying value less direct costs to sell. Gains and losses are recognised as other operating earnings. In connection with each closing date, a determination is made of each asset’s residual value and useful life. Tangible fixed assets are recognised as an asset in the balance sheet if it is likely that the future economic benefits will accrue to the Company and the cost of the asset can be reliably estimated. Leasing The Group applies IFRS 16 Leases. IFRS 16 stipulates that for leases of significance, a right of use asset and a lease liability are to be recognised. The exception is short-term leases and lease agreements for lower-value assets, for which lease fees are expensed on a straight-line basis. The right of use asset is recognised with linear amortisation over the term of the contract. The lease liability is recognised including interest expenses in accordance with the effective interest rate method. These liabilities are valued at the present value of the future minimum lease payments, discounted at the marginal loan rate. Taxes The Group applies IAS 12 Income Taxes. Income taxes consist of current tax and deferred tax. Income taxes are recognised in the income statement unless the underlying transaction is recognised directly in other total comprehensive income and in shareholders’ equity, in which case the related tax effect is recognised in other total comprehensive income and in shareholders’ equity. Current tax is tax that is to be paid or received during the year in question applying the tax rates applicable on the balance sheet date; which includes adjustment of current tax attributable to previous periods. Deferred tax is calculated according to the balance sheet method based on temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their value for tax purposes. The following temporary differences are not taken into account: temporary differences that arise in the initial reporting of goodwill, the initial reporting of assets and liabilities in a transaction other than a business combination and which, at the time of the transaction, do not affect either the recognised or taxable result, or temporary differences attributable to participations in subsidiaries and associated companies that are not expected to be reversed within the foreseeable future. The valuation of deferred tax is based on how the carrying values of assets or liabilities are expected to be realised or settled. Deferred tax is calculated by applying the tax rates and tax rules that have been set or essentially are set as of the balance sheet date. ----- ##### Deferred tax assets from deductible temporary differences and tax-loss carry forwards are only recognised if it is likely they will be utilised within the foreseeable future. The value of deferred tax assets is reduced when it is no longer considered likely they can be utilised. Shareholders’ equity Share repurchases and transaction expenses are recognised directly against equity. Dividends are recognised as a liability after they are approved by the Annual General Meeting. Provisions The Group applies IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets. A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or informal obligation owing to an event that has occurred and it is likely that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. The carrying amount for the provision is based on an assessment of the most likely outcome, and can be calculated by weighing the various possible outcomes and multiplying this by their estimated probability. Where it is important when in time payment will be made, provisions are estimated by discounting the forecast future cash flow at a pre-tax interest rate that reflects current market estimates of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks associated with the liability. A provision for restructuring is recognised when a detailed, formal restructuring plan has been established and the restructuring has either begun or been publicly announced. No provision is made for future operating expenses. A provision for termination costs is recognised only if the persons in question have known or presumed to have expected to be terminated by the balance sheet date. A provision is recognised for a loss-making contract when anticipated benefits that the Group expects to receive from a contract are less than the unavoidable costs to fulfil the obligations as set out in the contract. A provision for dilapidation agreements on leased premises is recognised if there is a contractual obligation to the landlord to restore the premises to a certain condition when the lease expires. Unidentified receipts and excess payments The Group receives large volumes of payments from end-customers for itself and its clients. There are instances where the sender’s reference information is missing or incorrect, which makes it difficult to allocate the payment to the right case. There are also situations where payments are received on closed cases. In such instances a reasonable search and attempt is made to contact the payment sender but, failing this, the payment is recognised as income after a certain interval. A provision is recognised in the balance sheet corresponding to the anticipated repayments of incorrectly received payments on a probability analysis. Contingent liabilities A contingent liability is recognised when there is a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by one or more uncertain future events or when there is an obligation that is not recognised as a liability or provision because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required. ----- ##### Impairment The Group applies IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. The carrying value of the Group’s assets, with certain exceptions, is tested on each balance sheet date for any indication of impairment. IAS 36 is applied in the impairment testing of all assets except financial assets, which are valued in accordance with IAS 9, investment assets for pension liabilities, which are valued in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits, and tax assets, which are valued in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes. If there is any indication of impairment, the asset’s recoverable value is estimated. For goodwill and other intangible assets with an indeterminate useful life and intangible assets not yet brought into use, recoverable values are calculated annually. If essentially independent cash flows cannot be isolated for individual assets, the assets are grouped at the lowest level where essentially independent cash flows can be identified, i.e., a cash-generating unit. Intrum’s operations in each geographical region are considered to be the Group’s cash-generating units in this regard. Impairment is recognised when the carrying value of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable value. Impairment is recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses attributable to a cash-generating unit are mainly allocated to goodwill, after which they are divided proportionately among other assets in the unit. The recoverable amount of cash-generating units is the higher of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Value in use is measured by discounting future cash flows using a discounting factor that takes into account the risk-free rate of interest and the risk associated with the specific asset. Impairment of goodwill is not reversed. Impairment of other assets is reversed if a change has been made in the assumptions that served as the basis for determining the recoverable amount. Impairment is reversed only to the extent the carrying value of the assets following the reversal does not exceed the carrying value that the asset would have had if the impairment had not been recognised. Employee benefits The Group applies IAS 19 Employee Benefits. Pension obligations The Group’s pension obligations are, for the most part, secured through official pension arrangements or insurance solutions. Pension obligations vary between countries on the basis of legislation and different pension systems. See also Note 21 for a further description. Defined contribution pension plans are plans where the Company’s obligation is limited to the fees it has committed to pay. The size of the employee’s pension depends in part on the fees the Company pays to an insurance company and in part on the return generated and actuarial factors. Consequently, it is the employee who assumes the investment risk and actuarial risk. The Company’s obligations for defined contribution pension plans are expensed through the income statement as they are vested by employees who render services on behalf of the Company. For defined benefit pension plans, the pension obligation does not cease until the agreed pensions have been paid. The Group’s net obligation for defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating future compensation the employees has earned in current and previous periods; this compensation is discounted to its present value. ----- ##### The discount rate is the interest rate as per the balance sheet date on high-quality corporate bonds, including covered bonds, with a maturity that, if possible, corresponds to the Group’s pension obligations. The calculation is performed by an actuary using the so-called Projected Unit Credit Method. The fair value of Intrum’s share of any investment assets as of the balance sheet date is calculated as well. Actuarial gains and losses may arise in the determination of the present value of the obligation and the fair value of investment assets. They arise either because the actual outcome deviates from previous assumptions or the assumptions change. All changes in value associated with such changes in assumptions are recognised in other comprehensive income. The balance sheet value of pensions and similar obligations is therefore equivalent to the present value on the balance sheet date less the fair value of assets under management. Pension costs for service in the current period are reported in the operating earnings, while the calculated interest expense on the pension liability and the interest income from assets under management are reported in net financial items. Pension obligations in Sweden that are met through pension insurance premiums to Alecta in the so-called ITP 2 plan are reported as defined contribution pension solutions. Borrowing costs The Group applies IAS 23 Borrowing Costs and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. Costs to secure bank financing are amortised across the term of the loan as financial expenses in the consolidated income statement by applying the effective interest method. The amount is recognised in the balance sheet as a deduction to the loan liability. The Group capitalises borrowing costs in the cost of qualifying assets, that is, fixed assets for substantial amounts with long periods of completion. No such investments have yet commenced. Revenue recognition The Group applies IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Intrum’s principal income derives from sales of collection services and from investments in portfolios of overdue receivables. Income from the collection services is reported in accordance with IFRS 15 and consists of collection fees, commissions, debtors’ fees and subscription income. Income from investments in portfolios of overdue receivables is reported in accordance with IFRS 9 and consists of income from the portfolios, calculated according to the effective interest method, as well as positive and negative revaluations. Revenue, consisting of commissions and collection fees, is recognised on collection of the claim. Subscription revenue is recognised proportionately over the term of the underlying service contracts, which is usually one year. Revenue from other services is reported when the service has been performed, at a particular point in time that is. In addition to income from collection services and investments in portfolios of overdue receivables, Intrum has certain other income, the most important of which is income from property sales and income from property services. In addition, Intrum has certain smaller sources of income from, for example, payment guarantees, credit information sales, customer account management, consulting services, factoring operations and VAT recovery services. Income from property sales refer mainly to sales of properties acquired together with portfolios of overdue receivables and properties pledged as collateral accruing to Intrum on the ----- ##### settlement of the claim. Income from property services is generated in a single country, where Intrum has companies that sell services to property owners, such as tenant administration, property valuations, key management and relocation of tenants. Income from property sales and from property services are reported separately from other income in Note 2, as they are of greater importance in terms of their amounts than the smaller items in other income, and, where they are considered different from one another and from Intrum’s other income with regard to their terms, nature and risk. These are not usually reported separately in interim reports, presentations to investors or internal reports to the CEO, however. To a certain extent, Intrum owns properties that are to be sold within the ordinary course of business. The properties are usually acquired together with portfolios of overdue receivables, by taking possession of pledged assets or through acquisition at executive auction called for to liquidate pledged assets where Intrum is the creditor for the underlying receivable. The properties are reported as inventory assets applying the valuation rules in IAS 2. Sales of properties constituting inventory assets are reported gross, that is, the sales amount received is recognised as income in the income statement, while the reported value of the property is reported as cost of goods sold. Income from property sales is reported when the control passes to the buyer when the buyer gains access to the property. Financial income and expenses Financial income and expenses consist of interest income on bank balances and receivables and interest-bearing securities, bank fees, interest expenses on loans, dividend income, exchange rate differences, realised and unrealised gains on financial investments, and derivatives used in financial operations. Payment guarantees Intrum offers some of the Group’s clients the opportunity, against payment, to obtain a guarantee from Intrum regarding the clients’ receivables from their customers. The guarantee entails an undertaking by Intrum to acquire the receivable from the creditor at its nominal value, or a certain part thereof, once it has fallen overdue for payment by a certain number of days. The income, in the form of a guarantee fee, is recognised when the guarantees are issued, while a liability is recognised in the balance sheet for expected losses related to those guarantees. If the debtor fails to make payment, Intrum acquires the claim. The disbursement is then recognised as portfolio investments, less the liability recognised when the guarantee was issued. Cash flow statement The Group applies IAS 7 Cash Flow Statements. The cash flow statement includes changes in the balance of liquid assets. The Group’s liquid assets consist of cash and bank balances. Cash flow is divided into cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash flow from investing activities includes only actual disbursements for investments during the year. Disbursements for the purchase of portfolios of overdue receivables are reported under cash flow from investing activities, while the collection and repayment of such portfolios are reported under cash flow from operating activities. ----- ##### Foreign subsidiaries’ transactions are translated in the cash flow statement at the average exchange rate for the period. Acquired and divested subsidiaries are recognised as cash flow from investing activities, net, after deducting liquid assets in the acquired or divested company. Earnings per share The Group applies IAS 33 Earnings per Share. Earnings per share consist of net earnings for the year (attributable to the Parent Company’s shareholders) divided by a weighted average number of outstanding shares during the year. In this context, treasury holdings of repurchased shares are not included in outstanding shares. With regard to treasury shares that may be reissued in the future to fulfil commitments under the incentive programme for company management, no dilution effect is calculated until the vesting requirements of the incentive programme have been met. Segments The Group applies IFRS 8 Operating Segments. An operating segment is a part of the Group from which it can generate income and incur expenses and for which separate financial information is available. that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, i.e. the CEO in deciding how to assess performance and allocate resources to the operating segment. Intrum’s operating segments are the geographical regions of Northern Europe (Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Norway and Sweden), Central and Eastern Europe (Greece, Poland, Romania, Switzerland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary and Austria), Western and Southern Europe (Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK), as well as the Iberian Peninsula and Latin America (Spain, Portugal and Brazil). Central and joint expenses are spread across the geographical regions in proportion to their purchasing power parity-adjusted revenues. The break-down by geographical region is also used for internal monitoring in the Group. As of 2020, new operating segments will be applied: Credit Management Services (CMS), Portfolio Investments (PI) and Strategic Markets (Greece, Italy and Spain). Among other things, Note 2 details net revenue and operating earnings by geographic region. However, interest income, interest expenses, assets and liabilities are not reported by segment. This is not considered relevant because the distribution of financial items and parts of the balance sheet is dependent on Group structure and financing, which are not affected by the actual performance of the regions. Nor are actual reported interest income, interest expenses, assets and liabilities by segment included in any internal reporting to the CEO. Parent Company’s accounting principles The Parent Company has prepared the Annual Report according to the Annual Accounts Act (1995:1554) and recommendation RFR 2 Accounting for Legal Entities from the Swedish Financial Reporting Board. RFR 2 means that the Parent Company, in the annual report for the legal entity, must apply all EU-approved IFRS and statements as far as possible within the framework of the Annual Accounts Act and taking into account the connection between reporting and taxation. The recommendation specifies exemptions and additions relative to IFRS. As of 2019, Intrum has made a new interpretation of the rules in RFR 2 Accounting legal entities, entailing the Parent Company’s exchange rate differences attributable to the hedging of the Group’s exchange rate risk in foreign operations no longer being reported under Other ----- ##### comprehensive income but under Net financial items in the Parent Company’s income statement. Comparison figures for the preceding year were recalculated in the same way. The amended interpretation with regard to the Parent Company’s accounting has no impact on the consolidated financial statements. Differences between the Group’s and Parent Company’s accounting principles The differences between the Group’s and Parent Company’s accounting principles are indicated below. The accounting principles for the Parent Company as stated below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the Parent Company’s financial statements. Subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures Shares in subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures are recognised by the Parent Company at cost, including transaction costs less any impairment. Only dividends received are recognised as income. Credit risks in the Parent Company’s receivables from subsidiaries have been considered, showing no significant need for impairment. Group contributions and shareholders’ contributions for legal entities The Company reports Group contributions and shareholders’ contributions in accordance with statement RFR 2 of the Swedish Financial Reporting Board. Group contributions received are recognised as dividends and Group contributions paid are recognised as shareholders’ contributions. Shareholders’ contributions are recognised directly in the shareholders’ equity of the recipient and capitalised in the shares and participating interests of the contributor, to the extent impairment is not required. Other The presentation format for the Parent Company’s income statement and balance sheet follows the rules in the Annual Accounts Act, which deviate marginally from the consolidated presentation format in accordance with IFRS. The accounting rules for leasing in accordance with IFRS 16 that are applied in the consolidated accounts are also applied in the Parent Company’s accounts. Intrum has also made a new interpretation of the rules in RFR 2 Accounting legal entities, entailing the Parent Company’s exchange rate differences attributable to the hedging of the Group’s exchange rate risk in foreign operations no longer being reported under Other comprehensive income but under Net financial items in the Parent Company’s income statement. Comparison figures for the preceding year were recalculated in the same way. The amended interpretation with regard to the Parent Company’s accounting has no impact on the consolidated financial statements. ----- ##### Note 2 Information by geographical region and service line Information by geographic region and service line",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reported net if they relate to the same tax authority or are planned to be utilised simultaneously. Intrum has reported net income in a foreign subsidiary in accordance with the so-called CFC taxation of earnings in foreign subsidiaries with low taxed income in the Swedish income tax returns. Income recognition has been based on accounting in accordance with Swiss law and a deferred tax liability has been recognised, attributable to temporary differences in the accounting period, which also affected the income statement . The income recognition will be adjusted in accordance with Swedish accounting rules, entailing a reduction in deferred tax liabilities for portfolio investments, which will partly be offset by loss carryforwards and an increased current tax liability. The Group has tax-loss carryforwards that can be utilised against future taxable surpluses totalling SEK 5.952 M (6.293). Deferred tax assets related to loss carryforwards amounted to SEK 1,193 M at 31 December 2019 and include SEK 854 M in Sweden, SEK 163 M in Norway, SEK 68 M in Spain, SEK 38 M in the Netherlands, SEK 36 M in Italy, SEK 18 M in the UK and SEK 15 M in Austria. As a consequence of the costs for the head office expenses and financing costs, the Parent Company has for several years incurred a tax deficit, even when taking in to account the Group contributions received from the profitable companies conducting business in Sweden. In accordance with CFC taxation and investments in profit participating notes in foreign subsidiaries liable for taxation in Sweden, the assessment is that the loss carryforwards can be utilised. Loss carryforwards for which no deferred tax assets are reported relate primarily to the UK with SEK 461 M, Denmark with SEK 44 M, Sweden with SEK 44 M and Italy with SEK 21 M. Non-taxable income and non-deductible expenses in the Parent Company consist primarily of dividends from subsidiaries, as well as gains on disposals of shares. At the end of the year, the Parent Company had accumulated loss carryforwards of SEK 487 M (68). To the extent that it is expected to be possible to utilise them against future taxable surpluses, deferred tax assets are reported for these loss carryforwards in the amount of SEK 104 M (8). Tax expenses reported in other comprehensive income during the year amounted to SEK 174 M (79), of which SEK 175 M (81) pertained to currency hedging and SEK -5 M (-2) pertained to revaluations of pension provisions. The tax effect of implementing the new accounting principle/IFRIC 23 was SEK -154 M and is reported directly against shareholders’ equity. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

The recoverable amount is determined through an estimation of its value in use. For each cash-generating unit, management has compiled a projection of annual future cash flows based on historical experience and the Company’s own plans and estimates for the future. The calculation is generally based on a detailed forecast for the years 2020-2022 and thereafter an annual increase of 1 percent. Exceptions are for Iberian Peninsula & Latin America where the assumption for the period after 2022 is an everlasting growth in cash flows that are essentially unchanged. The cash flows have been discounted to present value applying the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, which is estimated at 6.0 percent (6.2) per year before tax, corresponding to 4.2 percent (4.8) per year after tax. The recoverable amount has been compared for each unit with the Group’s net book value of the unit’s assets and liabilities. Impairment testing is based on a number of assumptions, where the outcome is judged to be most sensitive to some of those assumptions in particular: For 2021, annual revenue growth of 4 percent (4) is assumed, and for 2022, 4 percent (1), with each SEK 1,000 in increased revenue being assumed to result in an increase in working capital of SEK 250 (250), that is, an “incremental increase in earnings” of 25 percent (25). For the period after 2022, perpetual growth in cash flow of 1 percent (1) annually is assumed. Most of the assumptions were applied for all four geographical regions. The same discount rates were also applied, since no significant long-term difference can be identified between the regions’ growth potential or risk. ----- ##### With these assumptions, it was necessary to impair goodwill attributable to the Iberian Peninsula and Latin America region by approximately SEK 2.7 billion as a consequence of challenges in Spain and lower earnings levels compared to previous periods with other market conditions. There is no need for impairment for the other three regions. Sensitivity analysis A sensitivity analysis has been performed, in which cash flows have been discounted at 6 percent interest after tax. With this assumption, it was necessary to impair goodwill attributable to the Iberian Peninsula and Latin America region by approximately SEK 3 billion, in addition to the aforementioned approximately SEK 2.7 billion, and Western and Southern Europe approximately SEK 1.8 billion.

The VAT portion of the acquired receivable can be recovered from the tax authorities if it is not collected from the end-customer and is therefore recognised as a separate receivable. The portion that is expected to be recovered within 12 months is recognised as current. In the Netherlands, bailiffs are private companies and expenses for collection cases paid to them can sometimes be recovered from the bailiffs if their collection measures fail. When it emerges that Intrum is entitled to request that the amount be returned from the enforcement authorities, the amount is moved from Outlays on behalf of clients, to To recover from enforcement authorities. In the third quarter of 2019, Intrum reclassified a receivable as done in previous year to the acquisition cost for the ownership share in the joint venture and thus at a surplus value in the underlying assets.

All shares are fully paid in, carry equal voting rights and share equally in the Company’s assets and earnings. No shares are reserved for transfer. There are 131,541,320 shares in the Company, and the share capital amounts to SEK 2,899,805.49. See below regarding repurchased shares. Share repurchase In 2018, 250,000 shares were repurchased for SEK 56 M and, in 2019, 350,000 shares were repurchased for SEK 86 M. Accordingly, the number of shares outstanding at the end of 2018 was 131,291,320 and, at the end of 2019, there were 130,941,320 shares. The average number of shares outstanding over the year was 131,065,782 (131,390,632). ----- ##### Other shareholders’ equity in the Group Other paid-in capital Refers to equity other than share capital contributed by the owners or arising owing to the Group’s shared-based payment programmes. Also included are share premiums paid in connection with new issues. Reserves Includes the translation reserve, which contains all exchange rate differences that have, since the transition to IFRS in 2004, arisen in the translation of financial statements from foreign operations as well as long-term intraGroup receivables and liabilities that represent an increase or decrease in the Group’s net investment in the foreign operations. The amount also includes exchange rate differences arising in the Parent Company’s external loans in foreign currency, which are intended to hedge the Group’s translation exposure attributable to net assets in foreign subsidiaries. Retained earnings including net earnings for the year Refer to earnings in the Parent Company and subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated companies. Provisions to the statutory reserve, excluding transferred share premium reserves, were previously included in this item. Accumulated revaluations of the Group’s defined benefit pension provisions are also included. Dividends paid and share repurchases are deducted from the amount. Following the balance sheet date, the Board of Directors proposed a dividend of SEK 11 per share (9.50), or a total estimated payout of SEK 1,440 M (1,247). Other shareholders’ equity in the Parent Company Statutory reserve Refers to provisions to the statutory reserve and share premium reserve prior to 2006. The statutory reserve is restricted equity and may not be reduced through distributions of earnings. Share premium reserve When shares are issued at a premium, the amount exceeding their quota value is transferred to the share premium reserve. Provisions to the share premium reserve as of 2006 are non- restricted equity. Fair value reserve Refers to unrealised exchange rate gains or losses on external loans in foreign currency, which are intended to hedge the Group’s translation expo sure attributable to net assets in foreign subsidiaries. The fair value reserve is non-restricted equity. Earnings brought forward Refer to retained earnings from the previous year less the dividend paid and share repurchases. Retained earnings are non-restricted equity. Capital structure The Company’s definition of capital corresponds to shareholders’ equity including holdings without a controlling interest, which at year-end totalled SEK 24,893 M (25,672). ----- ##### The measure of the Company’s capital structure used for control purposes is consolidated net debt in relation to pro forma rolling 12-month-adjusted cash EBITDA, which at year-end amounted to 4.3 (4.3). This ratio is calculated by placing current consolidated net debt at the end of the year in relation to pro forma cash EBITDA, including operations being phased out and including a calculated cash EBITDA throughout the period for larger units acquired during the year, and excluding non-recurring items (NRIs). Net debt is defined as the sum of interest- bearing liabilities and pension provisions less liquid funds and interest-bearing receivables. The Board of Directors has established financial targets for the Group, in which net debt divided by pro forma rolling 12-month-adjusted cash EBITDA, as stated above, shall be between 2.5 and 3.5 in the long term Note 21 Pensions Employees in Intrum’s companies are covered by various pension benefits, some of which are defined benefit plans and others as defined contribution plans. The Group applies IAS 19 Employee Benefits, which contains, among other things, uniform regulations on the actuarial calculation of provisions for pensions in defined benefit plans. Group employees in Switzerland, and certain employees in Germany, are covered by pension plans funded through assets under the management of insurance companies and are reported as defined benefit pension plans. Other employees in Germany and employees in Norway and Italy are covered by unfunded defined benefit pension plans that can be paid out as a one- time sum or as monthly payments following retirement. In France, the Company makes provisions for one-time payments made to employees on retirement, and these provisions are also reported according to the rules for defined benefit pension plans. In Belgium and Sweden, there are pension plans, funded through insurance, which theoretically should have been reported as defined benefit plans, but which are recognised as defined contribution plans since the Company lacks sufficient data to report them as defined benefit plans. See also below regarding the ITP 2 plan. Among other things, IAS 19 requires pension costs for service in the current period to be reported in the operating earnings, while the calculated interest expense on the pension liability and the interest income from assets under management are reported in net financial items. Actuarial revaluations are recognised in other comprehensive income. Provisions for pensions reported in the balance sheet can be analysed as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

Funded defined benefit pension plans For Group employees in Switzerland, commitments exist in the form of obligatory service pension plans funded through insurance policies in the Swiss Life Collective BVG Foundation and in Transparenta BVG Foundation. The funded commitments currently amount to SEK 335 M (307), and the fair value of the assets under management is SEK 240 M (237). Consequently, the net pension liability is SEK 94 M (70). The pension commitment is funded through insurance contracts. During the year Intrum paid SEK 41 M (42) to the plan, while disbursements to retirees amounted to SEK 56 M (43). For Group employees in Norway, mandatory occupational pensions commitments exist that were previously secured through a funded defined benefit pension solution, although these were replaced in 2019 by an unfunded defined benefit solution and a defined contribution solution. ----- ##### ITP 2 plan The commitments for retirement and family pensions for the Group’s Swedish employees are secured through insurance with Alecta according to the so-called ITP 1 and ITP 2 plans. ITP 1 includes employees born in 1979 or later, while ITP 2 covers employees born in 1978 or earlier. ITP 1 is a defined contribution plan. On the other hand, according to a statement from the Swedish Financial Reporting Board, UFR 10, the ITP 2 plan is a multi-employer defined benefit plan. Alecta’s customers have not had access to such information for the fiscal year that would make allow them to report their proportional share of plan assets, liabilities and costs, preventing it from being possible to report the plan as a defined benefit plan. Nor is there a contractual agreement how surpluses and deficits in the plan are to be distributed among plan participants. The ITP 2 plan secured through insurance with Alecta is therefore reported by Intrum as if it were a defined contribution plan. The premium is individually calculated, depending on salary, previously vested pension and anticipated remaining term of employment. At year-end Alecta’s surplus in the form of the collective funding ratio was 142 percent (154). The collective funding ratio consists of the market value of Alecta’s assets as a percentage of the insurance obligations calculated according to Alecta’s actuarial assumptions, which do not conform to IAS 19. Under the provisions of the ITP 2 plan, measures must be taken if the funding ratio falls below 125 percent (for example, in connection with an increase in the price of the subscription) or exceed 155 percent (for example, in connection with a premium reduction).

In February 2019, the banking group was expanded to six and the limit to EUR 1,375 M. The loan framework of EUR 1,375 M can be utilised for borrowing in a number of different currencies. As of 31 December 2019, the loan framework had been utilised for loans in Swedish kronor totalling SEK 6,186 M (6,534), in euro totalling EUR 435 M (295) and in Norwegian kronor totalling NOK 1,550 M (3,000). The unutilised portion of the facilities amounted to SEK 8,178 M (4,241). The loan carries a variable interest rate based on the interbank rate in each currency, with a margin. All operational and financial covenants were fully met in 2019. In December 2019 a new agreement regarding a new syndicated loan facility of EUR 1,800 M was signed with a bank consortium of 14 banks. The facility has a duration of five plus one years and came into effect on 15 January 2020. In connection with this, the previous facility, agreed in June 2017, was annulled. The new loan facility contains operations-related and financial covenants, including limits on financial indicators. In addition, the new credit agreement includes covenants that may restrict, condition or prohibit the Group from incurring additional debt, making acquisitions, disposing of assets, making capital and finance lease expenditures, allowing assets to be encumbered, changing the scope of the Group’s business and entering into a merger agreement. During 2017, Intrum AB issued public bonds divided into four tranches of a total EUR 2,700 M and SEK 3,000 M. In 2018, Intrum issued a public bond for SEK 1,000 M. In 2019, Intrum issued an MTN bond of SEK 2,000 M, which was later increased by SEK 900 M. In November, Intrum issued another bond of SEK 1,100 M, upon which the MTN programme was fully utilised. In addition, Intrum issued two bonds of EUR 800 M and EUR 850 M, respectively, the liquidity was used to repay two bonds with variable interest rates (EUR 300 M and SEK 3,000 M), and to reduce a fixed-rate bond by EUR 750 M, all of the earlier bonds had been issued in 2017 and were due to mature in 2022. In December 2019, a bond of EUR 75 M was issued with a maturity of five years and three months. Consequently, Intrum has outstanding bond loans for a total SEK 41,645 M (34,254). In 2019, Intrum also issued a commercial paper that, at the end of the year, amounted to SEK 2,794 M (2,123). Change in borrowings during the year Group",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

Pledged collateral also includes shares in subsidiaries within the Group pledged as collateral for the Parent Company’s revolving credit facility. The reported value of pledged collateral in the table above refers to the consolidated value of the subsidiaries’ net assets. Payment guarantees The Group offers services whereby clients, against payment, obtain a guarantee from Intrum regarding the clients’ receivables from their customers. This entails a risk being incurred that Intrum must compensate the customer for the guaranteed amount in the event that the invoices are not paid on time. In those cases where the guarantee comes into play, Intrum assumes the client’s claim against its customer and takes over the continued handling of the case within the Portfolio Investments area of operations. At the end of the year, the total amount guaranteed was SEK 92 M (120). Intrum’s risk in this business is managed through strict credit limits and analyses of the borrower’s credit status. As of year-end Intrum had allocated SEK 1 M (1) in the balance sheet to cover payments that may arise due to the guarantee. ----- ##### Other In Spain, a number of disputes are in progress against two former executives, attributable to their termination in June 2015. The disputes concern whether the dismissals were unlawful, the former executives’ entitlement to different bonuses and the entitlement to compensation for one of the former executives for a competition commitment in his employment contract. Intrum has won all disputes in the lower court, with the disputes over illegal dismissal having gained legal force and can no longer being possible to appeal. The remaining disputes are currently being addressed by the higher court. Intrum refutes all of these claims. In Poland, a dispute is in progress related to the acquisition of Casus Finanse S.A. in 2015. The dispute concerns the entitlement of the sellers, the former management of Casus Finanse SA, to an additional purchase consideration and remuneration for continued employment under the share transfer agreement. The former management of Casus Finanse SA was dismissed in December 2016, and Intrum’s position is that no entitlement to an additional purchase consideration nor remuneration for continued employment applies. The dispute has been referred to the arbitration panel, which in December 2019 settled the dispute substantially in Intrum’s favour. Although there is a theoretical possibility for the counterparties to appeal against the arbitration panel’s ruling, the risk of a successful appeal is considered small. The possible effect on the Group’s earnings of the above disputes is not assessed to be significant, and Intrum has made provisions for the disputes in accordance with the anticipated outcome. The Group is otherwise involved in disputes in the normal course of business. In the opinion of the Board, none of these disputes are expected to give rise to any significant cost.

Parent Company figures refer strictly to cash payments, however. For information on compensation to the Group’s senior executives, see Note 28. Note 28 Terms and conditions of employment for senior executives Guidelines on compensation for senior executives The 2019 Annual General Meeting adopted guidelines for remuneration to senior executives, the CEO and members of Group Management. The proposal has been prepared by the Board and its Remuneration Committee. Salary and remuneration philosophy Intrum is dependent on its employees to achieve ambitious objectives in a challenging environment. The salary and remuneration philosophy seeks to ensure our employees are rewarded for their valuable contributions to the Company’s earnings. We also strive to be able to recruit, develop and retain high-performance employees in a competitive international ----- ##### environment. At the same time, we try to ensure that our employees are offered salaries in line with the market. Remuneration levels should reflect duties, responsibility and performance, and should be competitive compared with similar companies in similar sectors in the same geographic area. To ensure that appropriate behaviours are encouraged, and that efforts are focused in the appropriate areas, remuneration levels need to be related to the objectives closely associated with the Group’s business strategy and its core values. The total remuneration is based on four principal components: fixed salary, variable salary, long-term incentive programmes and pension benefits. Other benefits, such as a company car, may be offered as well. Fixed salary component Fixed salary is set based on three perspectives: The complexity and responsibility of the post, individual performance and local market conditions. Variable salary component Intrum’s variable salary component (VSP) serves to encourage short-term performance. It is set for one year at a time. The metrics are set individually for each member of Group Management to reflect the Group’s business strategy and priorities. The metrics reflect business targets or other generation of value for the Company. Short-term variable salary also entails the Company’s expenses varying depending on the Group’s financial development. Short-term variable salary is capped at 50 percent of fixed annual salary for the CEO and at between 35 and 50 percent for other members of Group Management. However, the Chief Risk Officer does not receive a variable salary component. Long-term incentives Our long-term variable salary programme (LTIP) brings Group Management’s long-term interests and perspectives are brought onto an equal footing with those of shareholders, while commitment to the Company is also reinforced. This rewards long-term generation of value over a three-year period, allowing Group Management to participate in the Company’s financial success. Performance targets set by the Board of Directors in terms of the Group’s earnings per share (EPS) is generally applied as a metric because this is considered a good indicator of the Group’s long-term success. As with the variable salary component, an effect of the programme’s design is that the salary cost varies alongside the Group’s financial performance. The long-term incentive programme is proposed to be offered to Group management through the allocation of Performance Shares. The maximum allocation is 150 percent of fixed annual salary for the CEO, CFO and CIO and between 35 and 50 percent of fixed annual salary for other members of Group Management. The outcome of the long-term incentive programme is not pensionable. Pension benefits, etc. Retirement pension, disability and health insurance and similar benefits are to be designed to reflect the practices and requirements in the senior executives’ home countries. ----- ##### Expenses for variable salary components and long-term incentive programmes For 2019, the expenses are expected to amount to at most SEK 19 M for the variable salary component and at most SEK 35 M for the 2019 long-term incentive programme, excluding social security contributions. The estimate does not take into account any changes in the composition of Group Management during the year. Guidelines for individual share ownership It is proposed that the guidelines for individual share ownership, applied since 2015, be discontinued due to the share-based incentive programme established in 2018. Other In the event of termination by Intrum, severance pay (if applicable) shall not exceed 12 months’ fixed salary. The Board of Directors shall have the right to depart from these remuneration guidelines if there is particular justification for doing so in individual cases. Role of the Remuneration Committee The Board of Directors has a Remuneration Committee whose task is to address the Group’s remuneration issues on behalf of shareholders and the Board. The Remuneration Committee is responsible for preparing the Group’s remuneration guidelines, which include general principles for how salaries and other remunerations are determined, as well as addressing remuneration issues concerning the CEO and Group Management. The Remuneration Committee comprises two Board members. Since the 2019 Annual General Meeting, the Remuneration Committee has consisted of Per E. Larsson (Chairman) and Magnus Yngen. The CEO and the Company’s Chief Human Resources Officer are co-opted to the Committee’s meetings, though not when their own remuneration is discussed. Terms of employment and remuneration of the CEO During 2019, Mikael Ericson, President and CEO, received remuneration in accordance with the Group’s principles as detailed above. In 2019, his fixed monthly salary was SEK 510,000, which was two percent more than in 2018. In addition to his fixed salary, he had the opportunity to receive 50 percent of his annual salary within the framework of the variable salary component and 50 percent of his annual salary within the framework of the 2017 long-term remuneration programme. In 2019, he was offered long-term incentives with an initial allocation of 150 percent of his fixed annual salary. In addition to his salary, the Company paid pension contributions corresponding to 35 percent of his fixed annual salary. The pension policy is a defined contribution plan and the retirement age is 65 years. He also had a company car in accordance with the Group’s car policy, as well as subsidised meals under the same terms as other Group employees in Sweden. Terms of employment and remuneration for other members of Group Management During 2019, other members of Group Management also had benefit levels in accordance with the Group’s principles as detailed described above. This includes fixed annual salary and the opportunity to receive 0-50 percent of annual salary within the framework of the variable salary component and, for former members of Intrum Justitia’s Group Management, 20-50 percent within the framework of the 2017 long-term remuneration programme. In 2019, they were offered long-term incentives with an initial allocation of 35-150 percent of their fixed annual salary. Pension benefits vary from country to country. In several cases, they are included in monthly salaries. Pension policies are defined contribution plans, and the retirement age is ----- ##### generally 65. Members of Group Management have company cars, in accordance with the Group’s car policy. Smaller benefits also occur according to local practice, such as subsidised meals and travel. In March 2017, certain senior executives, excluding the President and CEO, were offered an additional bonus, amounting to two or three months’ salary, linked to the merger between Intrum Justitia and Lindorff. Since the predetermined terms have been met, the exceptional bonus was paid out in March 2018. The variable remuneration for 2018 reported below includes the exceptional bonus, which was vested during the period 22 March 2017 to 31 March 2018. The notice of termination for members of Group Management Team varies from three to twelve months, regardless of whether termination is initiated by the employee or the Company. Remuneration for the year Other senior executives in the table are defined as members of Group Management (see pages 50-51) other than the CEO. In 2019, no new members were appointed and two stepped down. At the end of 2019, there were 10 other senior executives.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

According to the new accounting model, all contracts containing leases are to be recognised on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. If leases meet two criteria, 1) they are current leases (shorter than one year) and 2) they pertain to “low-value assets”, such as personal computers, laptops, tablets, telephones, office equipment or other items where the purchase price is typically below USD 5,000 (or EUR 4,300), they are not covered by IFRS 16 and are therefore recognised as ongoing expenses as prior to application of IFRS 16. Leased items covered by IFRS 16 within Intrum are office premises, motor vehicles, ITC equipment and other leasing. The Company has implemented the leasing standard applying the simplified method (modified retroactive approach) and the transitional effects of IFRS 16 are reported as retained earnings as of 1 January 2019 without recalculating the comparative figures. The foremost effect on the consolidated financial statements derives from accounting for office premises. Prior to implementation of IFRS 16, Intrum’s leases were classified as operational and financial leasing. As of 2019, all of Intrum’s leases are instead reported as non-current assets and financial liabilities in the statement of financial position. Rather than reporting the leasing fee as an operating expense, Intrum reports depreciation and interest expenses under Total comprehensive income for the year. The right-of-use assets are depreciated over the term of the lease. The lease liability represents the present value of future lease payments. The change in right-of-use assets and lease liabilities since implementation is summarised below. ----- ##### Right-of-use assets",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

They are valued based on a valuation technique that uses observable market data and thus falls under Level 2 in the valuation hierarchy according to IFRS 13. Financial assets include the balance sheet items: purchased debt, other long-term receivables, accounts receivable, client funds, other current receivables, accrued income, derivatives with positive value, cash and cash equivalents and, for the Parent Company, intra- Group receivables. The total recognised value of consolidated financial assets amounted to SEK 36,039 M (30,109) on the balance sheet date. Financial assets amounted to SEK 35,835 M (29,507) and financial assets recognised at fair value via the income statement amounted to SEK 204 M (602). ----- ##### The total recognised value of the Parent Company’s financial assets amounted to SEK 37,604 M (35,909) on the balance sheet date. Financial assets amounted to SEK 37,400 M (35,880) and financial assets recognised at fair value via the income statement amounted to SEK 204 M (229). Financial liabilities include the balance sheet items: non-current and current liabilities to credit institutions, bond loans, commercial papers, client funds payable, accounts payable, advances from clients, other current liabilities, accrued expenses for the Parent Company, intra-Group liabilities. The total recognised value of consolidated financial assets amounted to SEK 56,647 M (47,469) on the balance sheet date. Financial liabilities recognised at amortised cost amounted to SEK 56,291 M (47,440) and financial liabilities recognised at fair value amounted to SEK 356 M (29). The total recognised value of the Parent Company’s financial liabilities amounted to SEK 51,702 M (50,573) on the balance sheet date. Financial liabilities recognised at amortised cost amounted to SEK 51,346 M (50,544) and financial liabilities recognised at fair value amounted to SEK 666 M (29). Portfolio investments Portfolio investments consist of purchased debt reported at amortised cost according applying an effective interest rate model with an effective interest rate reflecting the risk of defaulted payment. Considering the purchased receivables are assessed to be in default they are classified to the third stage of credit risk as defined in IFRS 9. The Group determines the carrying value by calculating the present value of estimated future cash flows at the receivables’ original effective interest rate. Adjustments are recognised in the income statement. With this valuation method, the carrying value is the best estimate of the fair value of debt portfolios, in the Company’s opinion. On the balance sheet date, the carrying value of purchased debt amounted to SEK 28,508 M (24,830). An account of purchased debt by year acquired is provided in Note 33. Accounts receivable Accounts receivable are recognised at amortised cost with no discount being applied since the remaining maturity is judged to be short. Accounts receivable amounted to SEK 1,860 M (719) on the balance sheet date. Other receivables Other receivables have short maturities. Receivables in foreign currency are translated in the accounts at balance sheet date rates. Consequently, carrying value corresponds to fair value. Other receivables, including accrued income, amounted to SEK 3,764 M (3,211) on the balance sheet date. The item includes forward exchange contracts for SEK 204 M (229), recognised at fair value in the income statement. The remaining SEK 3,561 M (2,982) is valued at amortised cost. For the Parent Company, other receivables, including receivables from Group companies, amounted to SEK 36,825 M (35,857). The item includes forward exchange contracts for SEK 204 M (229), recognised at fair value in the income statement. The remaining SEK 36,622 M (35,628) is valued at amortised cost. Cash and cash equivalents Liquid assets mainly consist of bank balances. Liquid assets in foreign currency mainly consist of bank balances. Liquid assets in foreign currency are translated in the accounts at balance sheet date rates. Consequently, carrying value corresponds to fair value. On the balance sheet ----- ##### date, cash and cash equivalents amounted to SEK 1,906 M (1,348). For the Parent Company, the corresponding amount was SEK 220 M (251) on the balance sheet date. Liabilities to credit institutions The Parent Company’s and the Group’s loan liabilities carry market rate interest with short fixed interest terms. Liabilities in foreign currency are translated in the accounts at balance sheet date rates. Consequently, carrying value corresponds to fair value. On the balance sheet date, consolidated liabilities to credit institutions amounted to SEK 6,186 M (6,831) and for the Parent Company, they amounted to SEK 6,186 M (6,545). Bond loans The Parent Company and the Group had bond loans outstanding for a value of SEK 41,644 M (34,254) on the balance sheet date. The bond loans are recognised at amortised cost. The fair value of the bonds, in accordance with observable market data, is SEK 42,479 M (31,606) and classified as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy according to IFRS 13 Commercial papers The Parent Company and the Group had commercial papers outstanding for a value of SEK 2,794 M (2,123) on the balance sheet date. Accounts payable Accounts payable have short maturities. Liabilities in foreign currency are translated in the accounts at balance sheet date rates. Consequently, carrying value corresponds to fair value. Consolidated accounts payable amounted to SEK 512 M (488). For the Parent Company, the equivalent amount was SEK 72 M (33). Other liabilities The Parent Company’s and the Group’s other liabilities have short maturities. Liabilities in foreign currency are translated in the accounts at balance sheet date rates. Consequently, carrying value corresponds to fair value. Other liabilities, including accrued expenses amounted to SEK 5,588 M (3,773) on the balance sheet date. The item includes derivatives valued at SEK 356 M (29), recognised at fair value in the income statement (held for trade). Other liabilities, excluding derivatives amounted to SEK 5,233 M (3,744). For the Parent Company, other liabilities amounted to SEK 1,361 M (7,618) on the balance sheet date and included liabilities to Group companies and accrued expenses. Derivatives are recognised at fair value in the income statement (held for trade) and amounted to SEK 356 M (29). Other liabilities, excluding derivatives amounted to SEK 1,005 M (7,589). Offset of financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value comprise derivatives. Financial assets and liabilities are not offset in the balance sheet. However, there are legally binding agreements that allow offsetting should one of the counterparties for the Group’s derivatives suspend their payments. At the end of the year, Intrum had financial assets totalling SEK 29 M (29) that could be offset against debts should the counterparties suspend their payments. ----- ##### Note 33 Financial risks and financial policies Principles of financing and financial risk management The financial risks that arise in Intrum operations are limited. Thanks to a strong cash flow, combined with little need for investment and operating capital, external capital needs in the Group’s Credit Management operations are relatively low. The purchased debt operations have a greater need for capital, particularly during a growth phase. Intrum’s financing and financial risks are managed within the Group in accordance with the treasury policy established by the Board of Directors. The treasury policy contains rules for managing financial activities, delegating responsibility, measuring and identifying financial risks and limiting these risks. Internal and external financial operations are concentrated in Group Treasury in Stockholm and Oslo, which ensures economies of scale when pricing financial transactions. Because Group Treasury can take advantage of temporary surpluses and deficits in the Group’s various countries of operation, the Group’s total interest expense can be minimised. Market risk Market risk consists of risks related to changes in exchange rates and interest rate levels. Exchange rate risk Exchange rate risk is the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates will negatively affect the Group’s income statement, balance sheet and/or cash flows. The most important currencies for the Intrum Group, other than the Swedish krona (SEK), are the euro (EUR), the Swiss franc (CHF), the Hungarian forint (HUF) and the Norwegian krone (NOK). The following exchange rates have been used to translate transactions in foreign currency in the financial accounts:",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

Transaction exposure consists of net operating and financial receipts and disbursements in different currencies. Translation exposure consists of the effects from the translation of the financial reports of foreign subsidiaries and associated companies to SEK. Transaction exposure In each country, all income and most operating expenses are denominated in local currencies, and thus currency fluctuations have only a limited impact on the Company’s operating earnings in local currency. National operations seldom have receivables and liabilities in foreign currency. Income and expenses in national currency are thereby hedged in a natural way, which limits transaction exposure. The currency exposure that arises within the operating activities is limited to the extent it pertains to international collection operations. The subsidiaries’ projected flow exposure is not hedged at present. All major known currency flows are hedged on a continuous basis in the Group and the Parent Company through forward exchange contracts. ----- ##### Translation exposure Intrum operates in some 25 countries. The results and financial position of subsidiaries are reported in the relevant foreign currencies and later translated into SEK for inclusion in the consolidated financial statements. Consequently, fluctuations in the SEK exchange rate affect consolidated income and earnings, as well as equity and other items in the financial statements.

Regarding the currency risk attributable to currency interest rate swaps, see the description below under Interest rate risks. The Group hedges part of its translation exposure by means of currency hedging measures, consisting of external loans in foreign currency and derivative instruments. Over the year, goodwill was excluded as a hedged balance sheet item, contributing to a change year-on-year in the table above. There is an economic relationship between the hedged balance sheet items and the hedging instruments, in which the efficiency of the hedge is tested and adjusted ----- ##### monthly. The effects of the translation exposure and hedging measures have opposite values (negative/positive) and are reported under Other comprehensive income. The hedging instruments amounted to SEK -41,645 (-34,185) at year-end. No inefficiencies were reported during the year regarding hedges of net investments in foreign operations. Interest rate risks Interest rate risks relate primarily to the Group’s interest-bearing net debt, which amounted to SEK 49,105 M (42,122) on 31 December 2019. The loan rate is tied to the market rate. Intrum has a strong cash flow which gives the Group the option of repaying loans or investing in portfolios. The Group’s loans have a fixed interest term - currently about 46 months (30) for the entire loan portfolio. A 1-percent increase in market interest rates during the year would have adversely affected net financial items by approximately SEK 397 M. A 5-per- cent increase would have adversely affected net financial items by SEK 1,986 M. To establish an appropriate matching of currencies in the balance sheet and thus manage the currency risk between assets and liabilities, the Company uses currency interest rate swaps in which the Parent Company swaps liabilities in SEK and receives EUR at the same rate on both the start and maturity dates. In this way, the Company can maintain the desired level of hedging of shareholders’ equity per currency while also maintaining an interest rate exposure in the same currency. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk of a loss or higher-than-expected costs to ensure the Group’s ability to fulfil its short and long-term payment obligations to outside parties. The Group’s long-term financing risk is limited by confirmed loan facilities. The Group’s objective is that at least 35 percent of total committed loans have a remaining maturity of at least three years and that not more than 35 percent of the total have a remaining maturity of less than 12 months. In December 2019 a new agreement regarding a new syndicated loan facility of EUR 1,800 M was signed with a bank consortium of 14 banks. The facility has a duration of five plus one years and came into effect on 15 January 2020. In connection with this, the previous facility, agreed in June 2017, was annulled. The new loan facility contains operations-related and financial covenants, including limits on financial indicators. In addition, the new credit agreement includes covenants that may restrict, condition or prohibit the Group from incurring additional debt, making acquisitions, disposing of assets, making capital and finance lease expenditures, allowing assets to be encumbered, changing the scope of the Group’s business and entering into a merger agreement. During 2017, Intrum AB issued public bonds divided into four tranches of a total EUR 2,700 M and SEK 3,000 M. In 2018, Intrum issued a public bond for SEK 1,000 M. In 2019, Intrum issued an MTN bond of SEK 2,000 M, which was later increased by SEK 900 M. In November, Intrum issued another bond of SEK 1,100 M, upon which the MTN programme was fully utilised. In addition, Intrum issued two bonds of EUR 800 M and EUR 850 M, respectively, the liquidity was used to repay two bonds with variable interest rates (EUR 300 M and SEK 3,000 M), and to reduce a fixed-rate bond by EUR 750 M, all of the earlier bonds had been issued in 2017 and were due to mature in 2022. In December 2019, a bond of EUR 75 M was issued with a maturity of five years and three months. Consequently, Intrum has outstanding bond loans for a total SEK 41,644 M (34,254). In 2019, Intrum also issued a commercial paper that, at the end of the year, amounted to SEK 2,794 M (2,123). ----- ##### The Group’s aim is that the liquidity reserve, which consists of cash, bank balances and short- term liquid investments should amount to at least SEK 100 M more than the unutilised portion of committed lines of credit. The Group has deposited its liquid assets with established financial institutions where the risk of loss is considered remote. The Group’s finance function prepares regular liquidity forecasts with the purpose of optimising the balance between loans and liquid funds so that the net interest expense is minimised without, for that matter, incurring difficulties in meeting external commitments. The table below provides an analysis of the financial liabilities of the Group and the Parent Company broken down according to the amount of time remaining until the contractual maturity date. The amounts given in the table are the contractual, undiscounted cash flows. The amounts falling due within 12 months agree with the reported amounts since the discount effect is negligible.

Financial assets that potentially subject the Group to credit risk include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, portfolio investments, outlays on behalf of clients, derivatives and guarantees. For financial assets owned by Intrum, no collateral or other credit reinforcements have been received, with the exception of a certain portion of the Group’s portfolio investments. The maximum credit exposure for each class of financial assets corresponds to the carrying amount. Cash and cash equivalents The Group’s cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of bank balances and other short- term financial assets with a remaining maturity of less than three months. The Group has deposited its liquid assets with established banks where the risk of loss is considered remote. Accounts receivable The Group’s accounts receivable from clients and debtors in various industries, and are not concentrated in a specific geographical region. The Group’s largest client accounts for less than two percent of revenues. Most accounts receivable outstanding are with customers previously known to the Group and whose creditworthiness is good. For an analysis of accounts receivable by age, see Note 16. Portfolio investments As part of its portfolio investment operations, Intrum acquires portfolios of consumer receivables and tries to collect them. Unlike its conventional collection operations where Intrum works on behalf of clients in return for commissions and fees, in this case it assumes all the rights and risks associated with the receivables. The portfolios are purchased at prices significantly below their nominal value, and Intrum retains the entire amount it collects, including interest and fees. The acquired receivables are overdue and in many cases are from debtors who are having payment problems. It is obvious, therefore, that the entire nominal amount of the receivable will not be recovered. On the other hand, the receivables are acquired at prices significantly below their nominal value. The risk in this business is that Intrum, at the time of acquisition, overestimates its ability to collect the amounts or underestimates the costs of collection. The maximum theoretical risk is of course that the entire carrying value of SEK 28,508 M (24,830) would become worthless and have to be written off. To minimise the risks in this business, prudence is exercised in purchase decisions. The focus is on small and medium-sized portfolios with relatively low average amounts, to help spread risks. The average nominal value per case is approximately SEK 19,895. Portfolios are normally acquired from customers with whom the Group has had a long-term relationship. The acquisitions have generally consisted of unsecured debt, requiring relatively less capital and significantly simplifying administration compared with collateralised receivables. Since 2016, however, Intrum has also begun to acquire portfolios with underlying collateral, usually in the form of property mortgages. Intrum places high yield requirements on the portfolios it acquires. Before every acquisition, a careful assessment is made based on a projection of future cash flows (collected amount) from the portfolio. In these calculations Intrum benefits from its extensive experience in debt collection and from the Group’s scoring methods. Intrum therefore believes that it has the expertise required to evaluate these types of receivables. To enable acquisitions of larger portfolios at attractive risk levels, Intrum has, on occasion, ----- ##### partnered with other companies such as Piraeus Bank and Ibercaja Banco to share the capital investment and return. The currency risk is attributable to the translation of the balance sheet item Portfolio investments is limited due to currency hedging using loans in the same currency as the assets, and currency forwards. A considerable proportion of the acquisitions take place through forward flow agreements - that is, Intrum may have previously agreed with a company to acquire all of that company’s accounts receivable at a certain percentage of their nominal value once they are overdue by a certain number of days. In most of these agreements, however, Intrum has the opportunity to decline to acquire the receivables if, for example, their quality decreases. Risks are diversified by acquiring receivables from clients in different sectors and different countries. The Group’s purchased debt portfolios include debtors in 24 countries. The Group’s total carrying amount for purchased debt is distributed as follows: Of the total carrying value on the balance sheet date, 25 percent represents portfolio acquisitions in 2019, 20 percent acquisitions in 2018, 18 percent acquisitions in 2017 and 10 percent acquisitions in 2016. The remaining 27 percent relates to receivables acquired in or before 2015, which have therefore been past due for more than four years. In the case of a large share of the oldest receivables, Intrum has reached agreement with the debtors on payment plans. Outlays on behalf of clients As an element in its operations, the Group incurs outlays for court fees, legal representation, enforcement authorities, etc., which can be charged to and collected from debtors. In many cases Intrum has agreements with its clients whereby any expenses that cannot be collected from debtors are instead refunded by the client. The amount that is expected to be recovered from a solvent counterparty is recognised as an asset in the balance sheet on the line Other receivables. Derivative contracts The Parent Company and the Group hold forward exchange contracts to a limited extent. The credit risk in the Group’s forward exchange contracts is because the counterparty generally is a large bank or financial institution that is not expected to become insolvent. On the balance sheet date, assets regarding forward exchange contracts were valued at SEK 204 M (229), and liabilities at SEK 356 M (29). See Note 33 regarding the possibility of offsetting receivables and liabilities for derivative contracts. ----- ##### The contracts have short maturities, typically one or more months. All outstanding forward exchange contracts are restated at fair value in the accounts, with adjustments recognised in the income statement. The purpose of these forward exchange contracts has been to minimise exchange rate differences in the Parent Company attributable to receivables and liabilities in foreign currency. Outstanding forward exchange contracts at year end in the Parent Company and in the Group comprise the following currencies:",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

To achieve suitable currency matching between assets and liabilities, liabilities in SEK were exchanged to EUR at the same rate on the starting date and the date of maturity. ##### Payment guarantees The Group offers services whereby clients, against payment, obtain a guarantee from Intrum regarding the clients’ receivables from their customers. This entails a risk being incurred that Intrum must compensate the customer for the guaranteed amount in the event that the invoices are not paid on time. In those cases where the guarantee comes into play, Intrum assumes the client’s claim against its customer and takes over the continued handling of the case within the Portfolio Investments area of operations. At the end of the year, the total amount guaranteed was SEK 92 M (120). Intrum’s risk in this business is managed through strict credit limits and analyses of the borrower’s credit status. At the end of the year Intrum had allocated SEK 1 M (1) in the balance sheet to cover payments that may arise due to the guarantee. Note 34 Acquisitions of operations In the cash flow statement, SEK 5,135 M (8,587) is reported as acquisitions of subsidiaries and joint ventures. In 2019, Intrum agreed with Piraeus bank to acquire 80% of the bank’s plat form for management of overdue receivables for a cash payment of SEK 3,187 M and a possible deferred purchase price, which Intrum at the time of acquisition valued at SEK 310 M. In the second quarter, Intrum acquired 80 percent of the shares in the Spanish company Solvia Servicios Inmobiliaros for an amount of SEK 1,937 M. Intrum gained a controlling influence over the acquired company on 24 April 2019. For 2018, the amount relates to the acquisition of 51 percent of the shares in Intrum Italy Spa for an amount of SEK 1,883 M, the acquisition of 100 percent of the shares in Northwind Investment Holding Sl for an amount of SEK 1,787 M, the acquisition of Iplatform Consultoria e Participaçoes SA for an amount of SEK 15 M, and the acquisition of profit participating notes ----- ##### in Ithaca Investment DAC for an amount of SEK 4,902 M (recognised as participations in a joint venture). Acquisition Solvia During the quarter, Intrum acquired Solvia Servicios Inmobiliaros (Solvia) from Banco Sabadell.

Management has discussed with the Audit Committee the Group’s critical accounting principles and estimates as well as the application of these. Estimates and assumptions are continuously assessed on the basis of historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events considered reasonable under prevailing conditions. Actual outcomes may vary from the assessments made. The areas in which estimates and assumptions could entail significant risk of adjustment in the recognised amounts for assets and liabilities in future fiscal years are primarily the following: Impairment testing of goodwill As indicated in Note 10, an impairment test of goodwill was done prior to the preparation of the annual accounts. The geographical regions are judged to achieve a sufficient degree of integration that they form combined cash generating units. Recoverable amounts for cash generating units have been established by calculating their value in use. The assumptions and assessments made with regard to expected cash flows and discount rates in the form of weighted average cost of capital, as well as a sensitivity analysis are detailed in Note 10. Projections of future cash flows are based on the best possible assessments of future income and operating expenses. Portfolio investments As indicated in Note 14, the recognition of portfolio investments in overdue receivables is based on the Company’s own projection of future cash flows from the acquired portfolios. Although the Company has historically had good projection accuracy with regard to cash flows, future deviations cannot be ruled out. The Group applies internal rules and a formalised decision-making process in the adjustment of previously established cash flow projections. These entail, among other things, that cash flow projections are only in exceptional cases adjusted in the first year of ownership of a portfolio. Furthermore, an amendment of the cash flow projection normally requires an agreement between local management in the country in question and the Group’s risk department. All changes in cash flow projections are ultimately decided on by a central revaluation committee. Sales of portfolio investments The Group has occasionally sold certain portfolios of purchased debt. Divestments of portfolios are not included in the business model for this asset category. Intrum has assessed the transactions and concluded that a sale of purchased debt should be ----- ##### recognised in the same way as if an amount equivalent to the selling price had been collected as part of normal operations. For Intrum’s accounting, it does not matter if the same amount is received through collection from debtors or by sale to an external party. The entire sale price for the portfolios sold has been reported as the amount collected on purchased debt, and the entire carrying value remaining prior to the sale has been reported as amortisation of purchased debt. Useful lifetimes of intangible and tangible fixed assets Group Management establishes assessed useful lifetimes and thus consistent amortisation and depreciation for the Group’s intangible and tangible fixed assets. These estimates are based on historical knowledge of equivalent assets’ useful lives. Useful life and estimated residual values are tested on each balance sheet date and adjusted when necessary. Recognised values for each balance sheet date for intangible and tangible fixed assets, see Notes 10 and 11. Assessment of deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets for tax-loss carryforwards or other future tax deductions are recognised to the extent it is deemed likely that the deduction can be made against future taxable surpluses. Carrying amounts for deferred tax assets on each balance sheet date are provided in Note 8. Accounting of Polish investment funds The Group has operated in Poland since 2006 through investment funds designed for the purchasing and holding of portfolio investments. From the Group’s perspective, the funds function in practice as a subsidiary. Against this backdrop, Intrum has resolved to consolidate the investment funds as a subsidiary in the consolidated financial statements. Joint venture As stated in Note 13, in 2018, the Intrum Group invested in profit participating notes issued by the Irish company Ithaca Investment DAC. Through its holding in the profit participating notes and the wording of the agreement, Intrum holds a position closely corresponding to that of a shareholder in the company, and the consolidated accounts therefore treat the profit participating notes as though they were an equity instrument issued by Ithaca Investment DAC. Although Intrum’s holding corresponds to 80 percent of the profit participating notes issued shareholder loans, through an agreement with another investor holding 20 percent of the profit participating notes, the two parties share a controlling influence, and Intrum therefore reports the investment according to the rules for joint ventures. Provisions for restructuring As shown in Notes 3, 22 and 24, Intrum made provisions for future expenses in 2019, mainly for restructuring. These provisions have been made in accordance with the rules in IAS 37 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets. Among other things, these rules entail provisions only being made when Intrum has an existing liability or obligation as a result of events that have occurred. For restructuring, this only applies when a formal detailed plan has been drawn up and communicated to those concerned in sufficient detail that they have known or can be expected to have anticipated, by the balance sheet date, the termination of their employment. Also under other circumstances, provisions are made and costs expensed only when Intrum has an existing liability in the form of a legal or informal obligation to pay, by the balance sheet date, for goods or services received. ----- ##### Acquisitions In 2019, Intrum entered into agreements on acquisitions, in particular the acquisition of Solvia in Spain and the companies acquired through the partnership with Piraeus Bank in Greece. The acquisitions and acquisition analyses are detailed in Note 35. The acquisitions were large and complex, and the acquisition analyses may be adjusted in upcoming quarters. Note 36 Related parties In addition to associated companies and joint ventures, related parties include the Board of Directors and senior executives, according to Note 28, as well as close family members to these executives and other companies over which they can exert a significant influence. All transactions with related parties are conducted on market terms and at arm’s length. In 2019, Intrum purchased services from LBHF Joint Ventures Ltd for SEK 6.2 M, from Sothernwood Consulting for SEK 0.6 M and from CSA services for SEK 0.4 M. Three individuals, including the country manager for the UK, Edward Nott, are members of the Board of LBHF Joint Venture. In 2019, Intrum purchased services from Telecredit IFN SA for SEK 1.0 M. Catalin Feneleom Neagu is a shareholder in the company. In 2019, his involvement in Telecredit IFN was discontinued. In 2019, Intrum purchased services from Telecredit IFN SA for SEK 1.0 M. Catalin Feneleom Neagu is a shareholder in the company. In 2019, his involvement in Telecredit IFN was discontinued. “Although the Parent Company has close relationship to its subsidiaries, see Note 12, it has no transactions with other related parties. Over the year, the Parent Company received SEK 380 M (214) in income from sales of services to Group subsidiaries, and incurred SEK 107 M (75) in expenses attributable to services purchased from subsidiaries.” Note 37 Reconciliation of key figures",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

The ratio sets the service line’s earnings in relation to the amount of capital tied up and is included in the Group’s financial targets. During the year, the definition of average book value for the full year was adjusted to be based on the average of the quarters instead of the opening and closing book value for the full year. ----- ##### EBITDA Operating earnings before depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) are operating earnings after reversal of depreciation of fixed assets except portfolio investments. Cash EBITDA Cash EBITDA is operating earnings after depreciation on fixed assets as well as amortisation and revaluations of portfolio investments are added back. Items affecting comparability Significant earnings items that are not included in the Group’s normal recurring operations and that are not expected to return on a regular basis. These include revaluations of portfolio investments, restructuring costs, closure costs, reversal of restructuring or closure reservations, cost savings programs, integration costs, extraordinary projects, divestments, impairment of non-current fixed assets other than portfolio investments, acquisition and divestment expenses, advisory costs for discontinued acquisition projects, costs for relocation to new office space, termination and recruitment costs for members of Group Management and country managers, as well as external expenses for disputes and unusual agreements. Items affecting comparability are specified because they are difficult to predict and have low forecast values for the Group’s future earnings trend. Adjusted operating earnings (EBIT) Adjusted operating earnings (EBIT) are operating earnings excluding revaluations of portfolio investments and items affecting comparability. Note 38 Discontinued operations In connection with the merger between Intrum Justitia and Lindorff that was implemented on the 27th of June 2017, Intrum undertook to the European Commission to divest Intrum Justitia’s Norwegian subsidiaries, as well as Lindorff’s Swedish, Finnish, Danish and Estonian subsidiaries. In November 2017, Intrum agreed to divest these subsidiaries to a company in the Lowell Group, and the transaction was finalised in March 2018, in connection with which Intrum received the purchase consideration of SEK 7,511 M. In the income statement, the subsidiaries being divested in accordance with the above have been reported in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations as discontinued operations, with the comparative figures for previous years being recalculated.

Note 39 Events after the reporting year Buyback program On 13 March 2020 the Board of Directors of Intrum AB (publ) resolved to initiate a share buyback program with the purpose to reduce Intrum’s share capital through cancellation of the shares that are repurchased. Through the program, Intrum will return further funds to shareholders and it is the Board of Directors’ assessment that this will give the company a more optimal capital structure. The maximum number of shares that can be repurchased is 12,554,132. Impact of Covid-19 on Intrum’s business On 25 March 2020 Intrum informed that the effects of Covid-19 vary from market to market. To date, countries in southern Europe have been hardest hit by the ongoing virus outbreak, which has affected all aspects of society. Intrum’s Strategic Markets business line is experiencing delays in cash flows due to general restrictions brought in across countries and reduced activity in legal systems in particular. The secured assets relating to the cash flows however remain. In other European markets however, the effect on Intrum’s activities has been relatively limited. Global events related to the spread of Covid-19 are expected to have negative impacts on the company’s productivity and results for a period of time. Our preliminary assessment is that reported earnings will be affected to a greater extent than cash EBITDA, but it is currently too early to quantify the financial effects. Intrum has decided to reduce the rate of investment and increase the yield requirements on new portfolio investments while also to a very limited extent review M&A projects. Reduced M&A activity and lower investment in portfolio activities frees up a greater degree of cash flow in the business. As a result of the impact of Covid-19 on Intrum’s business, updated financial targets will be communicated at the capital markets day, which is planned to be held in the coming autumn. ----- ##### PROPOSED APPROPRIATION OF EARNINGS The Parent Company’s distributable funds are at the disposal of the Board of Directors as follows: SEK Share premium reserve 17,441,835,284 Retained earnings -2,612,982,535 Net earnings for the year -687,077,416",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

It concludes, among other things, that the proposed dividend is in line with the Company’s dividend policy and that the Board, having considered the nature, scope and risks of the Company’s operations, as well as the Company’s and the Group’s consolidation requirements, liquidity and financial position in general, has found no indications that the proposed dividend is unjustified. The Board of Directors and the President certify that the Annual Report has been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards in Sweden and that the consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with the international accounting standards referred to in Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002 on the application of international accounting standards.

Ernst & Young AB Jesper Nilsson Authorised Public Accountant ----- # Audit report To the general meeting of the shareholders of Intrum AB (publ), corporate identity number 556607-7581 Report on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts Opinions We have audited the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of Intrum AB (publ) for the year 2019. The annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the company are included on pages F-50 - F127 in this document. In our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the parent company as of 31 December 2019 and its financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in a ccordance with the Annual Accounts Act. The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the group as of 31 December 2019 and their financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU, and the Annual Accounts Act. The statutory administration report is consistent with the other parts of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. We therefore recommend that the general meeting of shareholders adopts the income statement and balance sheet for the parent company and the group. Our opinions in this report on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts are consistent with the content of the additional report that has been submitted to the parent company’s audit committee in accordance with the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 11. Basis for Opinions We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities section. We are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. This includes that, based on the best of our knowledge and belief, no prohibited services referred to in the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 5.1 have been provided to the audited company or, where applicable, its parent company or its controlled companies within the EU. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters of the audit are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of, and in forming our opinion thereon, the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context. We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying financial statements. Income recognition _Description_ Consolidated net revenues for 2019 amounted to SEK 15,985 M. As is evident from Notes 2 and 3 to the annual accounts, net revenues are distributed between the various revenue sources, including collection fees, commissions and fees, as well as amounts collected on portfolio investments less amortisation. The number of transactions in the various flows is extensive, which places high demands on the Company’s internal controls and administrative processes. We have therefore assessed the income statement and the related IT systems as a particularly important area in the audit. _How our audit addressed this key audit matter_ In our audit, we examined principles for revenue recognition, processes for significant revenue streams and related IT systems. We have, among other things, tested the Company’s controls, performed an analytical review and evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s controls for IT systems of relevance for income recognition. On a random basis, we have also examined income against agreements and amounts paid in. Processes for programme development, programme changes and access management have been reviewed, as has the monitoring and handling of incidents. We have also reviewed the disclosures in the financial statements regarding income recognition. Goodwill _Description_ Goodwill is reported in the amount of SEK 33,358 M in the consolidated balance sheet as per 31 December 2019. Over the fiscal year, goodwill increased by SEK 303 M as a consequence of acquisitions during the year and currency effect, however reduced by recognised impairment losses. The Company tests, at least annually and when there is an indication of impairment, that the carrying values do not exceed the assets’ recoverable amounts. The recoverable amounts are determined by calculating the value in use of each cash generating unit, in connection with which estimated future cash flows are discounted. The Company’s cash flow forecasts are based on historical experience, business plans and other forward-looking assessments. The impairment test for 2019 resulted in an impairment of SEK 2,700 M in the Iberian Peninsula and Latin America region. A description of the accounting principles for goodwill is presented in Note 1 and the impairment testing, as well as critical estimates and assumptions are presented in Notes 10 and 35. As a consequence of the reported amounts being of material importance to the financial reporting and the assessments and critical assumptions required for the calculation of the value in use, we have assessed goodwill accounting as an area of particular importance in the audit. _How our audit addressed this key audit matter_ We have assessed the Company’s process for performing impairment testing. We have examined valuation methods and calculations, the reasonableness of the assumptions made and sensitivity analyses for changed assumptions supported by our valuation specialists. Comparisons have been made with historical results, and other companies in the same sector. The precision of previous forecasts has been evaluated. We have also reviewed the disclosures in the financial statements regarding goodwill. Portfolio investments _Description_ Portfolio investments is reported at SEK 28 508 M in the consolidated balance sheet as per 31 December 2019. Reporting follows the effective interest method, where the carrying value of each portfolio corresponds to the present value of expected future cash flows. The expected cash flows are discounted at an effective interest rate determined on the acquisition of the respective portfolios. Current cash flow projections and book values ----- are monitored over the course of the year based on, among other things, achieved collection results, agreements reached with customers on instalment plans and macroeconomic information. Accounting principles for portfolio investments are presented in Note 1, critical estimates and assumptions are presented in Note 35, and a description of portfolio investments is given in Note 14. The Company’s accounting of portfolio investments is considered to be a particularly important area in the audit due to reported amounts being of significance for the financial reporting and the portfolio valuations require the Company to make estimates, assumptions and judgements. _How our audit addressed this key audit matter_ In our audit, we have, among other things, evaluated the Company’s processes for valuing portfolio investments, related IT systems, the valuation models applied, and the reasonableness of the assumptions made in calculating effective interest rates. We have also reviewed the company’s ongoing review of book values. We have also reviewed the disclosures in the financial statements regarding portfolio investments. Other Information than the annual accounts and consolidated accounts This document also contains other information than the annual accounts and consolidated accounts and is found on pages 1-52 and 103-114. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for this other information. Our opinion on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts does not cover this other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion regarding this other information. In connection with our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, our responsibility is to read the information identified above and consider whether the information is materially inconsistent with the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. In this procedure we also take into account our knowledge otherwise obtained in the audit and assess whether the information otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we, based on the work performed concerning this information, conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the preparation of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts and that they give a fair presentation in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and, concerning the consolidated accounts, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of annual accounts and consolidated accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the assessment of the company’s and the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They disclose, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis of accounting is however not applied if the Board of Directors and the Managing Director intends to liquidate the company, to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Audit Committee shall, without prejudice to the Board of Director’s responsibilities and tasks in general, among other things oversee the company’s financial reporting process. Auditor’s responsibility Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these annual accounts and consolidated accounts. As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. - Obtain an understanding of the company’s internal control relevant to our audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control. - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors and the Managing Director. - Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ and the Managing Director’s use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. We also draw a conclusion, based on the audit evidence obtained, as to whether any material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s and the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the annual accounts and consolidated accounts or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion about the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause a company and a group to cease to continue as a going concern. - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, including the disclosures, and whether the annual accounts and consolidated accounts represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. - Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated accounts. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our opinions. We must inform the Board of Directors of, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit. We must also inform of significant audit findings during our audit, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identified. We must also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, including the most important assessed risks for material misstatement, and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in the auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes disclosure about the matter. ----- Report on other legal and regulatory requirements Opinions In addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, we have also audited the administration of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director of Intrum AB (publ) for the year 2019 and the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss. We recommend to the general meeting of shareholders that the profit be appropriated (loss be dealt with) in accordance with the proposal in the statutory administration report and that the members of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director be discharged from liability for the financial year. Basis for opinions We conducted the audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities section. We are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director The Board of Directors is responsible for the proposal for appropriations of the company’s profit or loss. At the proposal of a dividend, this includes an assessment of whether the dividend is justifiable considering the requirements which the company’s and the group’s type of operations, size and risks place on the size of the parent company’s and the group’s equity, consolidation requirements, liquidity and position in general. The Board of Directors is responsible for the company’s organization and the administration of the company’s affairs. This includes among other things continuous assessment of the company’s and the group’s financial situation and ensuring that the company’s organization is designed so that the accounting, management of assets and the company’s financial affairs otherwise are controlled in a reassuring manner. The Managing Director shall manage the ongoing administration according to the Board of Directors’ guidelines and instructions and among other matters take measures that are necessary to fulfill the company’s accounting in accordance with law and handle the management of assets in a reassuring manner. Auditor’s responsibility Our objective concerning the audit of the administration, and thereby our opinion about discharge from liability, is to obtain audit evidence to assess with a reasonable degree of assurance whether any member of the Board of Directors or the Managing Director in any material respect: - has undertaken any action or been guilty of any omission which can give rise to liability to the company, or - in any other way has acted in contravention of the Companies Act, the Annual Accounts Act or the Articles of Association. Our objective concerning the audit of the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss, and thereby our opinion about this, is to assess with reasonable degree of assurance whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect actions or omissions that can give rise to liability to the company, or that the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss are not in accordance with the Companies Act. As part of an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. The examination of the administration and the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss is based primarily on the audit of the accounts. Additional audit procedures performed are based on our professional judgment with starting point in risk and materiality. This means that we focus the examination on such actions, areas and relationships that are material for the operations and where deviations and violations would have particular importance for the company’s situation. We examine and test decisions undertaken, support for decisions, actions taken and other circumstances that are relevant to our opinion concerning discharge from liability. As a basis for our opinion on the Board of Directors’ proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss we examined the Board of Directors’ reasoned statement and a selection of supporting evidence in order to be able to assess whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act.

The preparation of financial reports in accordance with IFRS requires the Board of Directors and Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the accounting principles and the carrying values of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and a number of other factors that under current circumstances seem reasonable. The result of these estimates and assumptions is then used to determine the carrying values of assets and liabilities that otherwise are not clearly indicated by other sources. Actual outcomes may deviate from these estimates and assumptions. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed regularly. Changes in estimates are recognised in the period in which the change is made, provided it has affected only this period, or the period the change was made and future periods if the change affects both current and future periods. Estimates made by the Company that have a significant impact on the financial statements and estimates, which could necessitate significant adjustments in financial statements in subsequent years, are described in more detail in Note 36.

151,Final Offerings 2020.md,51,LEGAL ADVISORS TO THE INITIAL PURCHASERS,51.501,Note 1: Significant accounting and valuation principles (continued) Changes in accounting principles,51.501.1,,"_Changes that entered into force in 2018_ Since 1 January 2018, Intrum has applied IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which replaced IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, and includes new rules for accounting of credit losses, portfolio investments and hedge accounting. The new rules regarding loan losses and hedge accounting had no significant effect on the Group. The new rules for portfolio investments entail Intrum continuing to report these according to an effective interest rate model, with some minor adjustments in the application. The greatest change is that, in accordance with IFRS 9, acquired credit-impaired receivables can be reported at a higher recognised value than cost if estimates of future cash flows change, which differs from Intrum’s current application of the corresponding rules under IAS 39. The effect was that earnings brought forward in the opening balance for 2018 increased by approximately SEK 50 M after tax. Comparative figures for previous years are not recalculated. Since 1 January 2018, Intrum also applies IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which replaced IAS 18 Revenue, and included new rules regarding when revenues on sales are to be reported in certain cases. IFRS 15 is based on revenue being recognised when control of the good or service is transferred to the customer, which differs from the previous basis in the transfer of risks and benefits. IFRS 15 introduced new ways of determining how and when revenue should be recognised, entailing a new approach compared with how revenue was previously reported. The sectors most affected were the construction and civil engineering sectors, as well as companies engaged in contract manufacturing. The new accounting rules had no significant effect on the Intrum Group but entailed new disclosure requirements. From 1 January 2019, the Group will apply IFRS 16 Leases, replacing IAS 17 Leases. IFRS 16 provides that leases previously accounted for as operating leases will generally start to be reported in a manner similar to the previous accounting of financial leases. This requires a right of use asset and a lease liability to also be reported for an operating lease, with associated reporting of costs for depreciation and interest, unlike previously when the leased asset and related liability were not entered in the accounts and lease payments were amortised on a straight-line basis as a lease expense. There are exceptions for short-term leases and leases of assets of low value. Based on the information available, the Group expects the principal effects on Intrum’s accounting to be that the Group’s total assets will increase by a preliminary amount of approximately SEK 450 M, calculated as per the beginning of 2019, with both an asset and a liability being reported with regard to leases in effect at any given time, and with operating earnings improving by a preliminary SEK 14 M through the implicit interest expense in the leases being reported in net financial items rather than in operating earnings. The Group plans to apply the modified retroactive method. This means that the cumulative effect of IFRS 16 being introduced will be reported under earnings brought forward in the opening balance as of 1 January 2019 without the comparison figures being translated. Leases of low value (assets that, in new condition, have a value of less than approximately SEK 50,000)—primarily comprising IT and office equipment—will not be included in the leasing debt but will continue to be expensed on a straight-line bases over the lease term. Accordingly, the amended accounting relates mainly to rented office premises and cars. Other changes to IFRS are not expected to have any material effect on the consolidated accounts.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

151,Final Offerings 2020.md,51,LEGAL ADVISORS TO THE INITIAL PURCHASERS,51.504,Note 1: Significant accounting and valuation principles (continued),51.504.1,,"The consolidated accounts include the annual accounts of all subsidiaries, i.e., companies in which the Parent Company, directly or indirectly, holds more than 50 percent of the votes or otherwise can exercise control over operations. A controlling interest is achieved when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from, its commitment to the Company and is able to affect returns by means of its decisive influence. An influence arises when the Group has existing rights enabling it to control the relevant operations, that is, the operations that significantly affect the Company’s performance. The consolidated accounts are prepared according to the acquisition method, which means that the acquisition of a subsidiary is treated as a transaction where the Group indirectly acquires the subsidiary’s assets and takes over its liabilities and contingent liabilities. The Group’s equity therefore includes only the portion of the subsidiary’s equity added since acquisition. The Group’s cost is determined through an acquisition analysis in connection with the acquisition. The analysis determines the cost of the shares or operations as well as the fair value of acquired, identifiable assets and assumed liabilities and contingent liabilities. The cost of the subsidiary’s shares or operations consists of the fair value of the compensation on the transfer date and transaction expenses directly attributable to the acquisition. The cost includes conditional purchase considerations recognised as liabilities at fair value per the acquisition date. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. In acquisitions where the cost exceeds the net value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities and contingent liabilities, the difference is reported as goodwill. When the difference is negative, it is recognised directly through profit or loss. Non-controlling interests arise in cases where the acquisition does not relate to the entire subsidiary. There are two options for recognising non-controlling interests. The two options are to recognise the percentage of non-controlling interests that makes up proportional net assets, or to recognise non-controlling interests at fair value, which means that non-controlling interests form a percentage of goodwill. The method used for recognising non-controlling interests is made on a case by case basis. The financial reports of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated accounts from the acquisition date until control ceases. Intra-Group receivables and liabilities, revenue and expenses, and unrealised gains and losses that arise from transactions within the Group are eliminated in their entirety in the consolidated accounts. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associated companies and joint ventures are eliminated to a degree corresponding to the Group’s ownership of those companies. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, to the extent there is an indication of impairment. _Associated companies and joint ventures_ The Group applies IAS 28 Investments in associates and joint ventures, and IFRS 11 Joint arrangements. Associated companies are companies that are not subsidiaries but where the Parent Company, directly or indirectly, has at least 20 percent of the votes or otherwise exercises significant influence without having control over the partly owned company. Participations in associated companies and joint ventures are recognised in the consolidated accounts according to the equity method, which means that the holding in the company is recognised at cost and subsequently adjusted to the Group’s share of the change in the associated company’s net assets. The value of the shares includes goodwill from the acquisition. The consolidated income statement includes the Group’s participation in the company’s earnings less goodwill impairment. The amount is reported under Participations in the earnings of associates and joint ventures. Dividends received from the company are not recognised in the income statement and instead reduce the carrying value of the investment. Any difference between the cost of an acquisition and the owner’s share of the net fair value of the associated company’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised in accordance with IFRS 3. The equity method is applied from the date a significant influence arises until the time it ceases or the associated company becomes a subsidiary. ----- If the Group’s share of reported losses in the company exceeds the carrying value of its participations, the value of those participations is reduced to nil. Losses can also be offset against the Group’s unsecured receivables from the company if they constitute part of the net investment. Further losses are not recognised provided the Group has not issued guarantees to cover them. _Joint ventures_ The Group applies IFRS 11 Joint arrangements. Joint arrangements pertain to companies in which Intrum and other part-owners manage operations jointly in accordance with a shareholder agreement. Joint arrangements classified as joint ventures are reported in the consolidated accounts in accordance with the equity method. Joint ventures are companies in which the Group, through collaborative agreements, shares a controlling interest with one or more parties, such that the Group is entitled to net assets rather than having a direct entitlement to assets and responsibility for liabilities. Jointly owned companies are recognised at cost and subsequently adjusted for the Group’s share of the change in the company’s net assets. The consolidated income statement includes the Group’s share of earnings, and this is reported under Participations in the earnings of associates and joint ventures. Dividends received from joint ventures are not recognised in the income statement and instead reduce the carrying value of the investment. The equity method is applied from the date on which joint control is gained until the date that it ceases or transitions to the sole influence of Intrum. Shared operations, usually conducted in a company format, are joint arrangements in which Intrum and one or more partners are entitled to all of the financial benefits related to the assets of the operations. Shared operations are reported according to the profit split method, meaning that each party to a joint venture reports its share of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. _Foreign currency_ The Group applies IAS 21 Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. _Transactions in foreign currency_ Group companies prepare their accounts in the local functional currency in the country where they have their operations. Transactions in a currency other than the local currency are recognised at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction day. When such transactions are offset or settled, the exchange rate may deviate from the one that applied on the transaction day, in which case a (realised) exchange rate difference arises. Moreover, monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are translated at the exchange rates on each balance sheet date, due to which an (unrealised) exchange rate difference arises. Both realised and unrealised exchange rate differences of this type are recognised in the income statement—in the operating result if, for example, they refer to accounts receivable or accounts payable, or in net financial items if they refer to financial investments and borrowing in foreign currency. To avoid exchange rate differences, receivables and liabilities in foreign currency are sometimes hedged through forward exchange contracts. The Group’s holding of forward exchange contracts is marked to market on each balance sheet date, and changes in value are recognised through profit or loss. _Translation of the financial statements of foreign operations_ Assets and liabilities in foreign operations, including goodwill and other Group surplus and deficit values, are translated from the functional currency to the Group’s reporting currency, Swedish kronor, at the exchange rate on balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated at the average rate, which serves as an approximation of the rate that applied on each transaction date. Translation differences arise in the translation of subsidiary accounts in part because the balance sheet date rate changes each period and in part because the average rate deviates from balance sheet date rate. Translation differences are recognised directly in total comprehensive income as the year’s change in the translation reserve. ----- Long-term receivables and liabilities between the Parent Company and subsidiaries can be seen as an extension or reduction of the net investment in each company. If this is the case, translation differences are recognised under other comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements. When foreign operations are sold, accumulated translation differences attributable to those operations are realised. During the year the Group did not hedge any other flow exposure pertaining to anticipated receipts or disbursements in foreign currency. method and an effective interest rate reflecting the degree to which the receivable is impaired. The portfolios belong to the third class of credit risk as defined in IFRS 9. In the income statement, income from portfolio investments is recognised, in accordance with the effective interest rate method, as the collected amount less amortisation. The collection is often performed by the same personnel who handle collections and debt surveillance on behalf of external clients within the Credit Management service line. The cost of collection is debited internally at market price and expensed in the income statement for the Portfolio Investments service line as a cost of services sold. Reporting follows the effective interest method, where the carrying value of each portfolio corresponds to the present value of all projected future cash flows discounted by an initial effective interest rate determined on the date the portfolio was acquired, based on the relation between cost and the projected future cash flows on the acquisition date. Changes in the carrying value of the portfolios are comprised of amortisation for the period and are recognised in the income statement as a charge against the revenue line. In connection with the purchase of each portfolio of receivables, a projection is made of the portfolio’s cash flows. Cash flows include the loan amount, reminder fees, collection fees and late interest that, based on a probability assessment, are expected to be received from customers, less forecast collection costs. With this forecast and the acquisition price including transaction costs as a basis, each portfolio is assigned an initial effective interest rate that is then used to discount cash flows through the life of the portfolio. Current cash flow projections are monitored over the course of the year and updated based on, among other things, achieved collection results, agreements reached with customers on instalment plans and macro-economic information including assessments of economic development and unemployment in each country. Cash flow projections are made at the portfolio level, since each portfolio of receivables consists of a small number of homogeneous amounts. On the basis of the updated cash flow projections and initial effective interest rate, a new carrying value for the portfolio is calculated in the closing accounts. The accounting model assumes each portfolio to be relatively homogeneous and comprising a large number of receivables for smaller amounts. Portfolios comprising individual larger receivables are valued on acquisition and at the level of the receivables in ongoing reporting over the life cycle of the portfolio and not at the portfolio level. The Group applies internal application rules which mean that the initial effective interest rate can be adjusted in certain cases without a change in the carrying value of the portfolio for minor projection adjustments within a predetermined interval. Changes over time in the book value can be divided into an anticipated time and interest rate component (amortisation) and a component related to changes in estimates of future cash flows (revaluation). The effects of changes in cash flow forecasts, including changes in the anticipated financial lifetime of the portfolio, are referred to as revaluations and treated symmetrically, i.e., both increases and decreases in forecast flows affect the portfolios’ book value and, as a result, earnings. This means that certain portfolios may be valued at an amount higher than their cost. Although selling portfolios of purchased debt is not included in the business model, when such sales do occur as an exception, the resulting sales price received for the portfolio is reported in the same way as if it had been recovered from the customers. The entire remaining carrying values of the portfolios are recognised as amortisation. The comparative figures for 2017 as regards portfolio investments refer to financial statements prepared on the basis of then existing accounting principles in IAS 39. The main difference is that the Group in 2017 applied a rule where a portfolio was never allowed to be recognised at a higher value than its acquisition cost. _Long-term receivables and other receivables_ Long-term receivables and other receivables are those that arise when the Company provides money without the intent to trade its claim. If the anticipated maturity is longer than one year they constitute long-term receivables, and if it is shorter they are other receivables. These receivables are recognised at amortised cost. ----- _Accounts receivable_ Accounts receivable are recognised at the amount expected to be received after deducting impaired receivables, which are determined individually or according to statistical models based on historical experience in each country. Provisions for impairment are made when the receivable is first recognised, for expected credit losses, and adjusted as needed over the lifetime of receivable. The anticipated maturity of accounts receivable is short, so they are carried at amortised cost without discounting. _Legal outlays_ The Group incurs outlays for court fees, legal representation, enforcement authorities, etc., which can be charged to and collected from customers. In certain cases Intrum has agreements with its clients where any expenses that cannot be collected from customers are instead refunded by the client. The amount that is expected to be recovered from a solvent counterparty is recognised as an asset in the balance sheet on the line Other receivables. The anticipated maturity of these receivable is short, so they are carried at amortised cost without discounting. _Client funds_ Client funds, which are reported as assets and liabilities in the balance sheet, represent cash received on collection of a specific debt on behalf of a client and payable to the client within a specified period. Client funds are liquid funds with a restricted disposition right. The same amount is reported as a liability. _Cash and cash equivalents_ Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, as well as immediately available balances with banks and similar institutions. Short-term investments consist of investments with an insignificant risk of fluctuating in value, which can easily be converted to cash and have a maturity of not more than three months from acquisition. _Liabilities_ Liabilities are initially recognised at the amount received following deduction of transaction costs. Subsequent to acquisition, loans are carried at amortised cost according to the effective rate method. Long-term liabilities have an anticipated remaining maturity of more than one year, while short-term liabilities have a maturity of less than one year. The Group’s long-term loans generally have short fixed interest periods, which means that the nominal loan amount plus accrued interest is a good approximation of the liability calculated according to the effective rate model. _Accounts payable_ Accounts payable are classified as valued at amortised cost. However, accounts payable have a short anticipated maturity and are carried without being discounting to a nominal amount. _Derivatives_ Derivatives consist of forward exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and currency interest rate swaps used to reduce interest and exchange rate risks attributable to assets and liabilities in foreign currency. Derivatives are also contractual terms embedded in other agreements. Embedded derivatives are recognised separately if they are not closely related to the host agreement. Forward exchange contracts are classified as financial assets or liabilities recognised at fair value via the income statement (held for trade) and assessed at fair value without deductions for transaction expenses that may arise on sale or similar. Hedge accounting is not needed for forward exchange contracts because the hedged item and the hedging instrument are carried at the closing rate with changes in value recognised in the income statement as exchange rate differences. Changes in the value of operations-related receivables and liabilities are recognised in operating earnings, while changes in the value of financial receivables and liabilities are recognised in net financial items. ----- Currency interest rate swaps are valued at fair value and reported in the balance sheet together with hedge accounting via Other comprehensive income. Currency interest rate swaps were signed in connection with the Parent Company’s issue of bonds in SEK that were exchanged for EUR to hedge net investments in foreign operations where the loan currency has been used in the operations. The liability in SEK was exchanged into the same liability in EUR on both the starting date and the date of maturity. _Hedge accounting with regard to exchange rate risk in the net investment in foreign subsidiaries_ Investments in foreign subsidiaries (net assets including goodwill) are to some extent hedged through loans in foreign currency or forward exchange contracts that are translated on the closing date to the exchange rate then in effect. Translation differences for the period on financial instruments used to hedge a net investment in a Group company are recognised in the degree the hedge is effective in total comprehensive income, while cumulative changes are recognised in equity (translation reserve). As a result, translation differences that arise when Group companies are consolidated are neutralised. e.g., by improving or extending a computer programme’s functionality beyond its original use and estimated useful life. IT development expenses that are recognised as intangible assets are amortised using the straight-line method over their useful lives (3–5 years). Useful life is reassessed annually. The asset is recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Costs associated with the maintenance of existing computer software are expensed as they are incurred. _Client relationships_ Client relationships that are recognised as fixed assets relate to fair value revaluations recognised upon acquisition in accordance with IFRS 3. They are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life (5–10 years). Useful life is reassessed annually. The asset is recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. _Other intangible fixed assets_ Other intangible fixed assets relate to other acquired rights are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life (3–5 years). Useful life is reassessed annually. The asset is recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. In operating leasing, lease payments are expensed over the lease term. Payments are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Benefits received in connection with the signing of an operating lease are recognised as part of the total lease expense in the income statement. contribution pension plans are expensed through the income statement as they are vested by employees who render services on behalf of the Company. For defined benefit pension plans, the pension obligation does not cease until the agreed pensions have been paid. The Group’s net obligation for defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating future compensation the employees has earned in current and previous periods; this compensation is discounted to its present value. The discount rate is the interest rate as per the balance sheet date on high-quality corporate bonds, including covered bonds, with a maturity that, if possible, corresponds to the Group’s pension obligations. The calculation is performed by an actuary using the so-called Projected Unit Credit Method. The fair value of Intrum’s share of any investment assets as of the balance sheet date is calculated as well. Actuarial gains and losses may arise in the determination of the present value of the obligation and the fair value of investment assets. They arise either because the actual outcome deviates from previous assumptions or the assumptions change. All changes in value associated with such changes in assumptions are recognised in other comprehensive income. The balance sheet value of pensions and similar obligations is therefore equivalent to the present value on the balance sheet date less the fair value of assets under management. Pension costs for service in the current period are reported in the operating earnings, while the calculated interest expense on the pension liability and the interest income from assets under management are reported in net financial items. Pension obligations in Sweden that are met through pension insurance premiums to Alecta in the so-called ITP 2 plan are reported as defined contribution pension solutions. and taking into account the connection between reporting and taxation. The recommendation specifies exemptions and additions relative to IFRS. _Differences between the Group’s and Parent Company’s accounting principles_ The differences between the Group’s and Parent Company’s accounting principles are indicated below. The accounting principles for the Parent Company as stated below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the Parent Company’s financial statements. _Subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures_ Shares in subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures are recognised by the Parent Company at cost, including transaction costs less any impairment. Only dividends received are recognised as income. Credit risks in the Parent company’s receivables against intercompany counterparts have been assessed, with the conclusion being that there is no significant impairment. _Group contributions and shareholders’ contributions for legal entities_ The Company reports Group contributions and shareholders’ contributions in accordance with statement RFR 2 of the Swedish Financial Reporting Board. Group contributions received are recognised as dividends and Group contributions paid are recognised as shareholders’ contributions. Shareholders’ contributions are recognised directly in the shareholders’ equity of the recipient and capitalised in the shares and participating interests of the contributor, to the extent impairment is not required. _A further goal is to reduce the proportion of fixed costs._ The Parent Company has no leases classified as finance leases in its own accounts or the consolidated accounts.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521
151,Final Offerings 2020.md,51,LEGAL ADVISORS TO THE INITIAL PURCHASERS,51.507,Financial assets and liabilities,51.507.1,,"The Group applies IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. The comparative figures for 2017 were prepared under IAS 39 rather than IFRS 9. A financial instrument is any form of agreement giving rise to a financial asset in a company and a financial liability or equity instrument in a counterparty. Financial instruments recognised in the balance sheet include, on the asset side, cash and bank balances, accounts receivable and other equity instruments, loans receivable, portfolio investments and derivatives. Client funds are recognised on a separate line in the balance sheet and therefore are not included in the Group’s reported liquid assets. Included among liabilities and equity are accounts payable, client funds payable, debt and equity instruments in issue, loan liabilities and derivatives. On initial recognition, financial assets (except accounts receivable with no significant financing component) and financial liabilities are valued at fair value plus (in the case of financial instruments not measured at fair value via the income statement) transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition or issue. Accounts receivable with no significant financing component are valued at the transaction price. On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as valued at amortised cost, fair value via other comprehensive income or at fair value via the income statement. Financial assets are not reclassified after initial recognition, unless the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets, in which case all of the financial assets concerned are reclassified from the first day of the reporting period commencing after the change in business model. A financial asset or financial liability is recognised in the balance sheet when the Company becomes party to the instrument’s contractual terms. Receivables are recognised when the Company has performed and there is a contractual obligation on the counterparty to pay, even if an invoice has not yet been received. Accounts receivable are recognised in the balance sheet when an invoice has been sent. Liabilities are recognised when the counterparty has performed and there is a contractual obligation to pay, even if an invoice has not yet been received. Trade accounts payable are recognised when an invoice is received. A financial asset is removed from the balance sheet when the rights in the agreement are realised, expire or the Company loses control over them. A financial liability is removed from the balance sheet when the obligation in the agreement has been discharged or otherwise extinguished. The fair value of listed financial assets corresponds to their listed market price on the balance sheet date. The fair value of unlisted financial assets is determined by using valuation techniques, e.g., recently conducted transactions, the price of similar instruments and discounted cash flows. For forward exchange contracts and currency interest rate swaps, fair value is determined based on listed prices. The fair value of forward exchange contracts and currency interest rate swaps is calculated by discounting the difference between the contracted forward rate and the forward rate that can be secured on the balance sheet date for the remaining contract period. The current value is obtained by discounting applying the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. For further information, see Note 34. _Portfolio investments_ Portfolio investments consist of portfolios of delinquent receivables purchased at prices significantly below the nominal receivable. Portfolio investments usually refer to receivables from private individuals and are often unsecured receivables. They are reported in accordance with the rules for acquired impaired (‘‘credit-impaired’’) receivables in IFRS 9, that is, at amortised cost applying the effective interest -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

151,Final Offerings 2020.md,51,LEGAL ADVISORS TO THE INITIAL PURCHASERS,51.512,Intangible fixed assets,51.512.1,,"_Goodwill_ Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of an acquisition and the fair value of the acquired assets, assumed liabilities and contingent liabilities. If the Group’s cost of the acquired shares in a subsidiary exceeds the market value of the subsidiary’s net assets according to the acquisition analysis, the difference is recognised as Group goodwill. The goodwill that can arise through business combinations implemented through other than a purchase of shares is recognised in the same way. For business combinations where the cost is less than the net value of acquired assets and assumed and contingent liabilities, the difference is recognised directly through profit or loss. Goodwill is recognised at cost less accumulated impairment. The fair value of goodwill is determined annually for each cash-generating unit in relation to the unit’s performance and anticipated future cash flow. If deemed necessary, goodwill is written down on the basis of this evaluation. Intrum’s operations in each geographical region (Northern Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, Western and Southern Europe, as well as the Iberian Peninsula and Latin America) are, in this context, considered to be the Group’s cash-generating units. Goodwill that arises from the acquisition of a company outside Sweden is classified as an asset in the local currency and translated in the accounts at the balance sheet date rate. _Capitalised expenses for IT development_ The Group applies IAS 38 Intangible Assets. Expenditures for IT development and maintenance are generally expensed as incurred. Expenditures for software development that can be attributed to identifiable assets under the Group’s control and with anticipated future economic benefits are capitalised and recognised as intangible assets. These capitalised expenses include staff for the development team and other direct and indirect expenses. Borrowing costs are included in the cost of qualified fixed assets. Additional expenditures for previously developed software, etc. are recognised as an asset in the balance sheet if they increase the future economic benefits of the specific asset to which they are attributable, -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,521
151,Final Offerings 2020.md,51,LEGAL ADVISORS TO THE INITIAL PURCHASERS,51.514,Tangible fixed assets,51.514.1,,"The Group applies IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 40 Investment Property. Tangible fixed assets are recognised at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes the purchase price and costs directly attributable to putting the asset into place and condition to be utilised in the way intended. Examples of directly attributable costs are delivery and handling, installation, consulting services and legal services. Depreciation is booked on a straight-line basis over the asset’s anticipated useful life (3–5 years). Useful life is reassessed annually. Investment properties are properties that have been acquired to be leased to others or used within the Group’s operations rather than being sold. They are reported in accordance with the cost method, applying depreciation over the estimated useful life of the buildings. Additional expenses are capitalised only to the extent that they increase value in relation to performance on the date on which the property was acquired. No depreciation is applied for land. The carrying value of a tangible fixed asset is excluded from the balance sheet when the asset is sold or disposed of or when no economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal of the asset. The gain or loss that arises on the sale or disposal of an asset is comprised of the difference between the sales price and the asset’s carrying value less direct costs to sell. Gains and losses are recognised as other operating earnings. An annual determination is made of each asset’s residual value and useful life. Tangible fixed assets are recognised as an asset in the balance sheet if it is likely that the future economic benefits will accrue to the Company and the cost of the asset can be reliably estimated.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

Leasing is classified in the consolidated accounts as either finance or operating leasing. When a lease means that the Group, as lessee, essentially enjoys the economic benefits and bears the economic risks attributable to the leased asset, it is classified as a finance lease. The leased asset is recognised in the balance sheet as a fixed asset, while the estimated present value of future lease payments is recognised as a liability. The portion of the lease fee that falls due for payment within one year is recognised as a current liability, while the remainder is recognised as a long-term liability. Minimum lease fees for finance leases are divided between interest expense and amortisation of the outstanding liability. Interest expense is divided over the lease term so that each reporting period is charged with an amount corresponding to a fixed interest rate for the liability recognised in each period. Variable fees are expensed in the period in which they arise. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

Income taxes are recognised in the income statement unless the underlying transaction is recognised directly in other total comprehensive income, in which case the related tax effect is recognised in other total comprehensive income. Current tax is tax that is to be paid or received during the year in question applying the tax rates applicable on the balance sheet date; which includes adjustment of current tax attributable to previous periods. Deferred tax is calculated according to the balance sheet method based on temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their value for tax purposes. The following temporary differences are not taken into account: temporary differences that arise in the initial reporting of goodwill, the initial reporting of assets and liabilities in a transaction other than a business combination and which, at the time of the transaction, do not affect either the recognised or taxable result, or temporary differences attributable to participations in subsidiaries and associated companies that are not expected to be reversed within the foreseeable future. The valuation of deferred tax is based on how the carrying values of assets or liabilities are expected to be realised or settled. Deferred tax is calculated by applying the tax rates and tax rules that have been set or essentially are set as of the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets from deductible temporary differences and tax-loss carry forwards are only recognised if it is likely they will be utilised within the foreseeable future. The value of deferred tax assets is reduced when it is no longer considered likely they can be utilised.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or informal obligation owing to an event that has occurred and it is likely that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. The carrying amount for the provision is based on an assessment of the most likely outcome, and can be calculated by weighing the various possible outcomes and multiplying this by their estimated probability. Where it is important when in time payment will be made, provisions are estimated by discounting the forecast future cash flow at a pre-tax interest rate that reflects current market estimates of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks associated with the liability. A provision for restructuring is recognised when a detailed, formal restructuring plan has been established and the restructuring has either begun or been publicly announced. No provision is made for future operating expenses. A provision for termination costs is recognised only if the persons in question have known or presumed to have expected to be terminated by the balance sheet date. A provision is recognised for a loss-making contract when anticipated benefits that the Group expects to receive from a contract are less than the unavoidable costs to fulfil the obligations as set out in the contract. A provision for dilapidation agreements on leased premises is recognised if there is a contractual obligation to the landlord, within the foreseeable future, to restore the premises to a certain condition when the lease expires. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

The carrying value of the Group’s assets, with certain exceptions, is tested on each balance sheet date for any indication of impairment. IAS 36 is applied in the impairment testing of all assets except financial assets, which are valued in accordance with IAS 9, investment assets for pension liabilities, which are valued in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits, and tax assets, which are valued in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes. If there is any indication of impairment, the asset’s recoverable value is estimated. For goodwill and other intangible assets with an indeterminate useful life and intangible assets not yet brought into use, recoverable values are calculated annually. If essentially independent cash flows cannot be isolated for individual assets, the assets are grouped at the lowest level where essentially independent cash flows can be identified, i.e., a cash-generating unit. Intrum’s operations in each geographical region are considered to be the Group’s cash-generating units in this regard. Impairment is recognised when the carrying value of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable value. Impairment is recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses attributable to a cash-generating unit are mainly allocated to goodwill, after which they are divided proportionately among other assets in the unit. The recoverable amount of cash-generating units is the higher of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Value in use is measured by discounting future cash flows using a discounting factor that takes into account the risk-free rate of interest and the risk associated with the specific asset. Impairment of goodwill is not reversed. Impairment of other assets is reversed if a change has been made in the assumptions that served as the basis for determining the recoverable amount. Impairment is reversed only to the extent the carrying value of the assets following the reversal does not exceed the carrying value that the asset would have had if the impairment had not been recognised",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

The guarantee entails an undertaking by Intrum to acquire the receivable from the creditor at its nominal value, or a certain part thereof, once it has fallen overdue for payment by a certain number of days. The income, in the form of a guarantee fee, is recognised when the guarantees are issued, while a liability is recognised in the balance sheet for expected losses related to those guarantees.

The disbursement is then recognised as an acquisition of a receivable, less the liability recognised when the guarantee was issued. ----- The Group offers services whereby clients, against payment, obtain a guarantee from Intrum regarding the clients’ receivables from their customers. This entails a risk being incurred that Intrum must compensate the client for the guaranteed amount in the event that the invoices are not paid on time. In those cases where the guarantee comes into play, Intrum assumes the client’s claim against its customer and takes over the continued handling of the case within the Portfolio Investments area of operations. At the end of the year, the total amount guaranteed was SEK 120 M (111). Intrum’s risk in this business is managed through strict credit limits and analyses of the borrower’s credit status.

An operating segment is a part of the Group from which it can generate income and incur expenses and for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, i.e. the CEO in deciding how to assess performance and allocate resources to the operating segment. Intrum’s operating segments are the geographical regions of Northern Europe (Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Norway and Sweden), Central and Eastern Europe (Greece, Poland, Romania, Switzerland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary and Austria), Western and Southern Europe (Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK), as well as the Iberian Peninsula and Latin America (Spain, Portugal and Brazil). Central and joint expenses are spread across the geographical regions in proportion to their purchasing power parity-adjusted revenues. The break-down by geographical region is also used for internal monitoring in the Group. In 2018, the composition of the Group’s operating segments, the geographic regions, was changed. The change entailed operations in Spain, Portugal and Brazil being reported in the Iberian Peninsula and Latin America region.

Central and joint expenses are spread across the geographical regions in proportion to their purchasing power parity-adjusted revenues. The break-down by geographical region is also used for internal monitoring in the Group. Intra-Group sales between the regions are made on commercial terms. Internal transactions between the business areas Financial Services and Credit Management Services relate to payment on commercial terms for work carried out within Credit Management regarding handling and collection on the Group’s portfolio investments. Payment is made in the form of a commission that is recognised as a cost within Financial Services, but which is eliminated in the Consolidated Income Statement. Interest income and expenses are not reported by segment. This is not considered relevant because the distribution of financial items is dependent on Group structure and financing and is not affected by the actual performance of the regions.

This means that no significant contractual liabilities or contractual assets are recognised beyond accounts receivable and accrued income as stated on separate lines in the balance sheet. Intrum can be paid for the services it renders, either more or less immediately, through fees and commission being deducted from the amounts collected and deposited in the client funds account, or on invoicing the client on payment terms customary in each market, for example 30 days. The price of the collection service can be set as a fixed fee per case, a percentage of the amount collected or a combination of the two. For certain clients and in certain markets, fixed fees are charged instead in accordance with the price list for specific collection measures in administrating the client case with the enforcement service or in court.

When differences arise between the tax value and carrying value of assets and liabilities, a deferred tax asset or tax liability is recognised. Such temporary differences mainly arise for portfolio investments, provisions for pensions and intangible assets.

Deferred tax assets are reported in the balance sheet, when it is expected to be possible to offset the loss carry forwards against taxable profits within the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised on a net basis if they refer to the same tax authority or are planned to be used simultaneously. The Group has tax-loss carry forwards that can be utilised against future earnings totalling SEK 6,293 M (6,215). On 31 December 2018, deferred tax assets regarding tax-loss carry-forwards amounted to SEK 935 M and included SEK 453 M in Sweden, SEK 231 M in Norway, SEK 105 M in Germany and SEK 74 M in Spain. The utilisation of tax-loss carry forwards is limited in time in Poland, where there were tax-loss carry-forwards for SEK 74 M (47) and in Slovakia, where there were tax-loss carry forwards for SEK 4 M (3). In Poland, the tax-loss carry-forwards may only be utilised during a period of five years from the year in which the loss was incurred and, in Slovakia, they may only be utilised during a period of four years. For Poland, deferred tax assets are recognised in the amount of SEK 4 M and, for Slovakia, in the amount of SEK 1 M. Tax-loss carry forwards for which no deferred tax assets are recognised pertain mainly to Sweden with SEK 1,541 M (1,484) and the UK with SEK 501 M (337). As a consequence of the costs for the head office expenses and financing costs, the Parent Company has for several years incurred a tax deficit, even when taking in to account the group contributions received from the profitable companies conducting business in Sweden. It is Intrum assessment that tax-loss carry forwards cannot be fully utilised against positive taxable income in the foreseeable future without first restructuring the Group internally so that, for example, the Parent Company’s interest expenses are transferred to foreign subsidiaries. If such restructuring is implemented, it may be relevant to evaluate the tax-loss carry forwards in the accounts. Loss carry forwards in Sweden may also be consumed through so-called CFC taxation on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries with revenues subject to low tax rates. Tax expenses recognised in other comprehensive income over the year amounted to SEK 79 M (15) of which SEK 81 M refers to currency hedges and SEK�2 M refers to remeasurements of pension -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

The recoverable amount is determined through an estimation of its value in use. For each cash-generating unit, management has compiled a projection of annual future cash flows based on historical experience and the Company’s own plans and estimates for the future. The calculation is based on a detailed forecast for the years 2019-2020 and thereafter an annual increase of 1 percent. The cash flows have been discounted to present value applying the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, which is estimated at 6.2 percent (5.1) before tax, corresponding to 4.8 percent (4.0) per year after tax. The recoverable amount has been compared for each unit with the Group’s net book value of the unit’s assets and liabilities. The test gave no indication of a need of goodwill impairment. Impairment testing is based on a number of assumptions, where the outcome is judged to be most sensitive to some of those assumptions in particular: For 2019, annual revenue growth of 4 percent (4) is assumed, and for 2020, 4 percent (2), with each SEK 1,000 in increased revenue being assumed to result in an increase in working capital of SEK 250 (250), that is, an ‘‘incremental increase in earnings’’ of 25 percent (25). For the period after 2020, perpetual growth in cash flow of 1 percent (1) annually is assumed. The same assumptions were applied for all four geographical regions. The same discount rates were also applied, since no long-term difference can be identified between the regions’ growth potential or risk.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

On the other hand, according to a statement from the Swedish Financial Reporting Board, UFR 10, the ITP 2 plan is a multi-employer defined benefit plan. Alecta’s customers have not had access to such information for the fiscal year that would make allow them to report their proportional share of plan assets, liabilities and costs, preventing it from being possible to report the plan as a defined benefit plan. Nor is there a contractual agreement how surpluses and deficits in the plan are to be distributed among plan participants. The ITP 2 plan secured through insurance with Alecta is therefore reported by Intrum as if it were a defined contribution plan. The premium is individually calculated, depending on salary, previously vested pension and anticipated remaining term of employment. At year-end Alecta’s surplus in the form of the collective funding ratio was 142 percent (154). The collective funding ratio consists of the market value of Alecta’s assets as a percentage of the insurance obligations calculated according to Alecta’s actuarial assumptions, which do not conform to IAS 19.

151,Final Offerings 2020.md,51,LEGAL ADVISORS TO THE INITIAL PURCHASERS,51.691,Other,51.691.1,,"In 2012, when Intrum acquired the Dutch company Buckaroo BV, a supplementary purchase consideration to the sellers was agreed that would be based on the results achieved by the Company during the period 2012–2014. Only part of the supplementary purchase consideration has been paid. In 2015, the sellers initiated legal proceedings, bringing claims against Intrum and some of its executives, demanding payment of additional purchase consideration. These demands are motivated by claims that the actions of Intrum (and its executives) caused a worse result in Buckaroo than expected, and thus a lower supplementary purchase consideration. Although Intrum divested the shares in Buckaroo in 2017, the claim on Intrum from the previous owners remains. Intrum refutes all of these demands and has not made any provisions with regard to these disputes. In Spain, a number of disputes are in progress in both higher and lower level courts against two former executives, attributable to their termination in June 2015. The disputes concern whether the dismissals were unlawful, the former executives’ entitlement to different bonuses and the entitlement to compensation for one of the former executives for a competition commitment in his employment contract. Although Intrum won in the court of first instance in 2018, the counterparties have appealed. Intrum refutes all of these claims. The potential impact on consolidated earnings is not considered to be material. In Poland, a dispute is in progress related to the acquisition of Casus Finanse S.A. in 2015. The dispute concerns the entitlement of the sellers, the former management of Casus Finanse SA, to an additional purchase consideration and remuneration for continued employment under the share transfer agreement. The former management of Casus Finanse SA was dismissed in December 2016, and Intrum’s position is that no entitlement to an additional purchase consideration nor remuneration for continued employment applies. The dispute has been referred to an arbitration board, which requested an expert opinion in 2018 and is expected to announce its ruling in the spring of 2019. Intrum Justitia has made a provision for the dispute in accordance with the anticipated outcome. The Group is otherwise involved in disputes in the normal course of business. In the opinion of the Board, none of these disputes are expected to give rise to any significant cost. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

151,Final Offerings 2020.md,51,LEGAL ADVISORS TO THE INITIAL PURCHASERS,51.698,Note 28: Terms of employment for senior executives Guidelines on compensation for senior executives,51.698.1,,"The 2018 Annual General Meeting adopted guidelines for remuneration to senior executives, the CEO and members of Group Management. The proposal has been prepared by the Board and its Remuneration Committee. _Salary and remuneration philosophy_ Intrum Justitia is dependent on its employees to achieve ambitious objectives in a challenging environment. The salary and remuneration philosophy seeks to ensure our employees are rewarded for their valuable contributions to the company’s earnings. We also strive to be able to recruit, develop and retain high-performance employees in a competitive international environment. At the same time, we try to ensure that our employees are offered salaries in line with the market. Remuneration levels should reflect duties, responsibility and performance, and should be competitive compared with similar companies in similar sectors in the same geographic area. To ensure that appropriate behaviours are encouraged, and that efforts are focused in the appropriate areas, remuneration levels need to be related to the objectives closely associated with the Group’s business strategy and its core values. The total remuneration is based on three principal components: fixed salary, incentive programmes and pension benefits. Other benefits, such as a company car, may be offered as well. Fixed salary is set based on three perspectives: The complexity and responsibility of the post, individual performance and local market conditions. _Variable salary component_ Intrum’s variable salary component primarily rewards financial business targets and serves to encourage short-term performance. It is set for one year at a time. The metrics are set individually for each member of Group Management to reflect the Group’s business strategy and priorities. The metrics reflect business targets or other generation of value for the Company. Short-term variable salary means that the Company’s expenses vary alongside the Group’s financial development and the employees’ individual performance. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,521
151,Final Offerings 2020.md,51,LEGAL ADVISORS TO THE INITIAL PURCHASERS,51.699,Note 28: Terms of employment for senior executives (continued),51.699.1,,"Short-term variable salary is capped at 50 percent of fixed annual salary for the CEO and at between 35 and 50 percent for other members of Group Management. However, the Chief Risk Officer does not receive a variable salary component. _Long-term incentives_ Through the long-term incentive programme, Group Management’s long-term interests and perspectives are brought onto an equal footing with those of shareholders, while commitment to the company is also reinforced. This encourages the long-term generation of value over a three-year period, allowing Group Management to participate in the company’s financial success. Growth in Intrum Justitia’s earnings per share is generally applied as a metric because this is considered a good indicator of the Group’s long-term success. As with the variable salary component, an effect of the programme’s design is that the cost varies alongside the Group’s financial performance. It is proposed that long-term incentives be offered in the form of shares or share-related instruments. The maximum initial allocation is 150 percent of fixed annual salary for the CEO, CFO and CIO and between 35 and 50 percent for other members of Group Management. The outcome of long-term incentives is not pensionable. _Costs_ For 2018, expenses for incentive programmes for the CEO and other members of Group Management are expected to amount to at most SEK 18 M for the variable salary component and at most SEK 33 M for the long-term incentive programme, excluding social security contributions.

The Group determines the carrying value by calculating the present value of estimated future cash flows at the receivables’ original effective interest rate. Adjustments are recognised in the income statement. With this valuation method, the carrying value is the best estimate of the fair value of debt portfolios, in the Company’s opinion. On the balance sheet date, the carrying value of purchased debt amounted to SEK 24,830 M (21,149). An account of purchased debt by year acquired is provided in Note 34. _Accounts receivable_ Accounts receivable are recognised at amortised cost with no discount being applied since the remaining maturity is judged to be short. Accounts receivable amounted to SEK 719 M (755) on the balance sheet date. _Other receivables_ Other receivables have short maturities. Receivables in foreign currency are translated in the accounts at balance sheet date rates. Consequently, carrying value corresponds to fair value. Other receivables, including accrued income, amounted to SEK 3,211 M (2,427) on the balance sheet date.

The remaining SEK 35,628 M (34,627) is valued at amortised cost. _Cash and cash equivalents_ Liquid assets mainly consist of bank balances. Liquid assets in foreign currency are translated in the accounts at balance sheet date rates. Consequently, carrying value corresponds to fair value. On the balance sheet date, cash and cash equivalents amounted to SEK 1,348 M (881).

Liabilities in foreign currency are translated in the accounts at balance sheet date rates. Consequently, carrying value corresponds to fair value. On the balance sheet date, consolidated liabilities to credit institutions amounted to SEK 6,831 M (2,703) and for the Parent Company, they amounted to SEK 6,545 M (2,694). _Bond loans_ The Parent Company and the Group had bond loans outstanding for a value of SEK 34,254 M (33,052) on the balance sheet date.

Financial assets and liabilities are not offset in the balance sheet. However, there are legally binding agreements that allow offsetting should one of the counterparties for the Group’s derivatives suspend their payments.

Transaction exposure consists of net operating and financial receipts and disbursements in different currencies. Translation exposure consists of the effects from the translation of the financial reports of foreign subsidiaries and associated companies to SEK. _Transaction exposure_ In each country, all income and most operating expenses are denominated in local currencies, and thus currency fluctuations have only a limited impact on the Company’s operating earnings in local currency. National operations seldom have receivables and liabilities in foreign currency. Income and expenses in national currency are thereby hedged in a natural way, which limits transaction exposure. The currency exposure that arises within the operating activities is limited to the extent it pertains to international collection operations. The subsidiaries’ projected flow exposure is not hedged at present. All major known currency flows are hedged on a continuous basis in the Group and the Parent Company through forward exchange contracts. _Translation exposure_ Intrum operates in some 25 countries.

The Group’s objective is that at least 35 percent of total committed loans have a remaining maturity of at least three years and that not more than 35 percent of the total have a remaining maturity of less than 12 months. Since June 2017, Intrum AB has had a four and a half year revolving syndicated loan facility totalling EUR 1,100 M with a bank consortium consisting of five Nordic banks. The loan framework of EUR 1,100 M can be utilised for borrowing in a number of different currencies. On 31 December 2018, the loan framework had been utilised for loans in SEK totalling SEK 0 M (700), in EUR totalling EUR 295 M (100), in GBP totalling GBP 102 M (0), in NOK totalling NOK 3,000 M (0) and in HUF totalling HUF 16,200 M (0). The unutilised portion of the facilities amounted to SEK 4,241 M (8,008). The loan carries a variable interest rate based on the interbank rate in each currency, with a margin. The loan facility contains operations-related and financial covenants, including limits on financial indicators. All of these covenants were fully met in 2018. In addition, the credit agreement includes covenants that may restrict, condition or prohibit the Group from incurring additional debt, making acquisitions, disposing of assets, making capital and finance lease expenditures, allowing assets to be encumbered, changing the scope of the Group’s business and entering into a merger agreement. In 2017, Intrum AB issued public bonds for approximately EUR 3,000 M, divided into four tranches totalling EUR 2,700 M and SEK 3,000 M. During 2018, Intrum issued an additional public bond for SEK 1,000 M, and thus has total outstanding bond loans for SEK 34,254 M (33,052). In 2018, Intrum also issued a commercial paper that, at the end of the year, amounted to SEK 2,123 M (2,269). The Group’s aim is that the liquidity reserve, which consists of cash, bank balances and short-term liquid investments should amount to at least SEK 100 M more than the unutilised portion of committed lines of credit. The Group has deposited its liquid assets with established financial institutions where the risk of loss is considered remote. The Group’s finance function prepares regular liquidity forecasts with the purpose of optimising the balance between loans and liquid funds so that the net interest expense is minimised without, for that matter, incurring difficulties in meeting external commitments. The table below provides an analysis of the financial liabilities of the Group and the Parent Company broken down according to the amount of time remaining until the contractual maturity date. The amounts given in the table are the contractual, undiscounted cash flows including interest. The amounts falling due within 12 months agree with the reported amounts since the discount effect is negligible. To minimise the risks in this business, prudence is exercised in purchase decisions. The focus is on small and medium-sized portfolios with relatively low average amounts, to help spread risks. The average nominal value per case is approximately SEK 18,465. Portfolios are normally acquired from clients with whom the Group has had a long-term relationship. The acquisitions have generally consisted of unsecured debt, requiring relatively less capital and significantly simplifying administration compared with collateralised receivables. Since 2016, however, Intrum has also begun to acquire portfolios with underlying collateral, usually in the form of property mortgages. Intrum places high yield requirements on the portfolios it acquires. Before every acquisition, a careful assessment is made basedon a projection of future cash flows (collected amount) from the portfolio. In these calculations Intrum benefits from its extensive experience in debt collection and from the Group’s scoring methods. Intrum therefore believes that it has the expertise required to evaluate these types of receivables. To enable acquisitions of larger portfolios at attractive risk levels, Intrum has, on occasion, partnered with other companies such as CarVal and Deutsche Bank to share the capital investment and return. The portfolio values are reassessed quarterly for impairment, based on historical collection patterns as well as macroeconomic forecasts. The currency risk is attributable to the translation of the balance sheet item Portfolio investments is limited due to currency hedging using loans in the same currency as the assets, and currency forwards. A considerable proportion of the acquisitions take place through forward flow agreements—that is, Intrum may have previously agreed with a company to acquire all of that company’s accounts receivable at a certain percentage of their nominal value once they are overdue by a certain number of days. In most of these agreements, however, Intrum has the opportunity to decline to acquire the receivables if, for example, their quality decreases. Risks are diversified by acquiring receivables from clients in different sectors and different countries. The Group’s purchased debt portfolios include customers in 21 countries. The Group’s total carrying amount for purchased debt is distributed as follows: ##### By country Germany 11% (14) Norway Spain Sweden 13% (13) France 41% (40) UK Other countries 12% (12) 8% 7% 8% (9) (6) (6) 16JUL201909141139 ##### By sector Telecommunications companies 7% 6% Banking sector (8) (7) Credit card receivables 14% (15) Other financial operations Other sectors 10% (5) 63% (65) 16JUL201909140975 Of the total carrying value on the balance sheet date, 26 percent represents portfolios acquired in 2018, 25 percent those acquired in 2017, 13 percent those acquired in 2016 and 12 percent acquired in 2015. The remaining 24 percent relates to receivables acquired in or before 2014, which have therefore been past due for more than four years. In the case of a large share of the oldest receivables, Intrum has reached agreement with the customers on payment plans. ----- _Outlays on behalf of clients_ As an element in its operations, the Group incurs outlays for court fees, legal representation, enforcement authorities, etc., which can be charged to and collected from customers. In many cases Intrum has agreements with its clients whereby any expenses that cannot be collected from customers are instead refunded by the client. The amount that is expected to be recovered from a solvent counterparty is recognised as an asset in the balance sheet on the line Other receivables. _Derivative contracts_ The Parent Company and the Group hold forward exchange contracts to a limited extent. The credit risk in the Group’s forward exchange contracts is because the counterparty generally is a large bank or financial institution that is not expected to become insolvent. On the balance sheet date, assets regarding forward exchange contracts were valued at SEK 229 M (212), and liabilities at SEK 29 M (55). See Note 33 regarding the possibility of offsetting receivables and liabilities for derivative contracts. The contracts have short maturities, typically one or more months. All outstanding forward exchange contracts are restated at fair value in the accounts, with adjustments recognised in the income statement. The purpose of these forward exchange contracts has been to minimise exchange rate differences in the Parent Company attributable to receivables and liabilities in foreign currency. Outstanding forward exchange contracts at year end in the Parent Company and in the Group comprise the following currencies:",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

Regarding the currency risk attributable to currency interest rate swaps, see the description below under Interest rate risks. The Group hedges itself against part of the translation exposure through currency hedging via external loans in foreign currency and derivatives. There is an economic relationship between the hedged balance sheet items and the hedge instruments where the efficiency of the hedges is tested and adjusted on a monthly basis. The effects of the translation exposure and the hedging arrangements have opposite signs and are reported in Other comprehensive income. Hedge instruments amounted to SEK�34, 185 M (�32, 012) at year-end. No inefficiency has been reported during the year as regards hedges of net investments in foreign operations. _Interest rate risks_ Interest rate risks relate primarily to the Group’s interest-bearing net debt, which amounted to SEK 42,122 M (37,322) on 31 December 2018. The loan rate is tied to the market rate. Intrum has a strong cash flow which gives the Group the option of repaying loans or investing in portfolios. The Group’s loans have a fixed interest term—currently about 30 months (39) for the entire loan portfolio. A 1-percent increase in market interest rates during the year would have adversely affected net financial items by approximately SEK 397 M. A 5-percent increase would have adversely affected net financial items by SEK 1,986 M. To establish an appropriate matching of currencies in the balance sheet and thus manage the currency risk between assets and liabilities, the Company uses currency interest rate swaps in which the Parent Company swaps liabilities in SEK and receives EUR at the same rate on both the start and maturity dates. In this way, the Company can maintain the desired level of hedging of shareholders’ equity per currency while also maintaining an interest rate exposure in the same currency.",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

Financial assets that potentially subject the Group to credit risk include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, portfolio investments, outlays on behalf of clients, derivatives and guarantees. For financial assets owned by Intrum, no collateral or other credit reinforcements have been received, with the exception of a certain portion of the Group’s portfolio investments. The maximum credit exposure for each class of financial assets corresponds to the carrying amount. _Cash and cash equivalents_ The Group’s cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of bank balances and other short-term financial assets with a remaining maturity of less than three months. The Group has deposited its liquid assets with established banks where the risk of loss is considered remote. _Accounts receivable_ The Group’s accounts receivable from clients and customers in various industries, are not concentrated in a specific geographical region. The Group’s largest client accounts for less than four percent of revenues. Most accounts receivable outstanding are with clients previously known to the Group and whose creditworthiness is good. For an analysis of accounts receivable by age, see Note 16. _Portfolio investments_ As part of its portfolio investment operations, Intrum acquires portfolios of consumer receivables and tries to collect them. Unlike its conventional collection operations where Intrum works on behalf of clients in return for commissions and fees, in this case it assumes all the rights and risks associated with the receivables. The portfolios are purchased at prices significantly below their nominal value, and Intrum retains the entire amount it collects, including interest and fees. The acquired receivables are overdue and in many cases are from customers who are having payment problems. It is obvious, therefore, that the entire nominal amount of the receivable will not be recovered. On the other hand, the receivables are acquired at prices significantly below their nominal value. The risk in this business is that Intrum, at the time of acquisition, overestimates its ability to collect the amounts or underestimates the costs of collection. The maximum theoretical risk is of course that the entire carrying value of SEK 24,830 M (21,149) would become worthless and have to be written off. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,521

This entails a risk being incurred that Intrum must compensate the client for the guaranteed amount in the event that the invoices are not paid on time. In those cases where the guarantee comes into play, Intrum assumes the client’s claim against its customer and takes over the continued handling of the case within the Portfolio Investments area of operations. At the end of the year, the total amount guaranteed was SEK 120 M (111). Intrum’s risk in this business is managed through strict credit limits and analyses of the borrower’s credit status.
