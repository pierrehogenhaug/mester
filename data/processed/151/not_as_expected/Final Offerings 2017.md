This Offering Memorandum contains various “forward-looking statements” that reflect management’s
current view with respect to future events and anticipated financial and operational performance.

“may,” “plan,” “estimate,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “aim” or “might” and similar expressions or the
negatives of these expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Other forwardlooking statements can be identified in the context in which the statements are made. Forward-looking
statements occur in a number of places in this Offering Memorandum, including, without limitation, in
the sections entitled “Summary,” “Risk Factors,” “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations of Intrum Justitia,” “Management Discussion and Analysis of_
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Lindorff,” “Industry Overview” and “Business” and_
include, among other things, statements relating to:

- our strategy, outlook and growth prospects;

- our operational and financial targets and dividend policy;

- our liquidity, capital resources and capital expenditure;

- our planned investments, acquisitions and/or divestments;

- the expectations as to future growth in demand for our products and services;

- the expected growth and other anticipated benefits, including any revenue or cost synergies,
following the Merger (as defined herein) and other recent acquisitions;

- our increased focus on certain business areas and movement into new business areas, such as
secured loans and receivables and real estate servicing;

- the impact of regulations on us and our operations;

- the impact of changes in tax regulations that we are subject to;

- the competitive environment in which we operate; and

- the outcome of legal proceedings.

Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable,
we can provide no assurances that such expectations will prove to be correct and that such statements
are guarantees of future performance because they are based on numerous assumptions. Any
forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made and we undertake no
obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise. Important risks, uncertainties and other factors that could
cause these differences include, but are not limited to:

- changes in the economic conditions in the markets in which we operate;

- inability to compete with businesses that may offer more attractive prices or have greater
financing resources;

- insufficient supply of portfolios to purchase and willingness of clients to outsource their credit
management services to us;

- reliance on clients in the financial services industry and risk of material failures in banking
systems;

- errors in our collection process or other operational matters, such as failure of third parties as part
of the supply chain to provide certain services;

- inability to purchase portfolios at sufficient levels, appropriate prices or of sufficient quality due to
a lack of supply or lack of funding;


-----

- failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and codes of practice or changes to the
regulatory environment in which we operate;

- failure of our statistical models and data analysis tools to accurately assess pricing terms and
project remaining cash flows from our portfolios;

- deterioration in the value of our existing portfolios and inability to address underlying concerns;

- inability to replace terminated or expired forward flow agreements;

- negative attention relating to the credit management industry in general, or to us in particular;

- inability to manage our international operations and expansion plans, achieve our strategic goals
or identify and anticipate future risks;

- failure to integrate acquired businesses, including Lindorff, dispose of businesses, including the
Carveout Business (as defined herein), and realize planned synergy benefits, within anticipated
timeframes or at all, from past or future acquisitions (including, without limitation, the Merger after
giving estimated effect to the disposal of the Carveout Business);

- risks related to the Transactions (as defined herein), including any litigation that may arise as a
result, and our ability to execute the Transactions in the manner and within the timetable currently
envisaged;

- reliance on our senior management team and trained employees;

- inability to maintain, manage, integrate and develop our IT or data analysis systems or anticipate,
manage or adopt technological advances within our industry; and

- failure to maintain IT security or protect our data analysis system.

Additional factors that could cause our actual results or performance to differ materially, include, but
are not limited to, those discussed under “Risk Factors.”

These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. We
expressly undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, other than as required by law or
regulation. You should interpret all subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable
to us or to persons acting on our behalf as being qualified by the cautionary statements in this Offering
Memorandum. Accordingly, prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any of
the forward-looking statements herein.

This Offering Memorandum contains certain synergy estimates, among others, relating to cost
reductions and other benefits expected to arise from the Merger after giving estimated effect to the
disposal of the Carveout Business, as well as costs related to implementing such measures. The
estimates present the expected future impact of the Merger and the integration of Lindorff into Intrum
Justitia’s existing business after giving estimated effect to the disposal of the Carveout Business. Such
estimates are based on a number of assumptions made in reliance on the information available to us
and management’s judgments based on such information. The assumptions used in estimating the
synergies arising from the Merger after giving estimated effect to the disposal of the Carveout Business
are inherently uncertain and are subject to a variety of significant business, economic and competitive
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the
synergy benefit estimates. The synergy estimates presented in this Offering Memorandum and/or our
ability to realize such estimates may be significantly affected by any additional measures,
commitments, undertakings or promises required to secure the European Commission’s approval of
the Merger. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions—Anticipated synergies from the
_Merger may not materialize.”_

### PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION

**Financial Information**

This Offering Memorandum contains the following financial information:

**_The Issuer_**

- the audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto of the Issuer
as of and for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (including comparative information
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014), which have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”) and
audited by the Issuer’s independent auditors, Ernst & Young AB, as set forth in their audit reports
included elsewhere herein (the “Issuer’s Audited Financial Statements”);

- the unaudited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto of the
Issuer as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, which have been prepared
in accordance with IFRS and reviewed by the Issuer’s independent auditors, Ernst & Young AB
(the “Issuer’s Interim Financial Statements” and, together with the Issuer’s Audited Financial
Statements, the “Issuer’s Financial Statements”);

**_Lindorff_**

- the audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto of Lock Lower
Holding AS (“Lock Lower Holding”) as of and for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015,
which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and audited by Lock Lower Holding’s
independent auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers AS, as set forth in their audit reports included
elsewhere herein (“Lock Lower Holding’s Audited Financial Statements”);

- the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto of
Lock Lower Holding as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, which have
been prepared in accordance with IFRS and reviewed by Lock Lower Holding’s independent
auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers AS (“Lock Lower Holding’s Interim Financial Statements”
and, together with Lock Lower Holding’s Audited Financial Statements, “Lock Lower Holding’s
**Financial Statements”); and**

- the audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto of Lindorff AB
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 (including comparative information as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2013), which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and
audited by Lindorff AB’s independent auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers AB, as set forth in their
audit report included elsewhere herein (“Lindorff AB’s Audited Financial Statements” and,
together with Lock Lower Holding’s Financial Statements, “Lindorff’s Financial Statements”).

Lock Lower Holding was established on May 22, 2014. Lock Lower Holding’s only assets consist of its
indirect interest in the share capital of Lindorff AB, which it acquired on October 6, 2014 upon
completion of the Prior Lindorff Acquisition (as defined herein), and intercompany loans. Lock Lower
Holding is a holding company created in connection with the Prior Lindorff Acquisition, with no
independent operations of its own. Prior to the completion of the Prior Lindorff Acquisition, Lock Lower
Holding did not have any assets or liabilities or conduct any operations.

As a result, and unless otherwise indicated, for historical periods ending on or prior to December 31,
2014, the financial information presented for Lindorff in this Offering Memorandum is the historical
consolidated financial information of Lindorff AB and for historical periods commencing on or after
January 1, 2015, the financial information presented for Lindorff in this Offering Memorandum is the
historical consolidated financial information of Lock Lower Holding. The comparability of the
consolidated financial statements of Lindorff AB and Lock Lower Holding may be limited. For example,
certain consultancy costs related to the Prior Lindorff Acquisition were incurred by Lock Lower Holding
and only a portion of the debt incurred by Lock Lower Holding in connection with the Prior Lindorff


-----

Acquisition was on-lent to Lindorff AB to refinance its existing debt, due to which there may be material
differences in the amount of liabilities and finance costs reflected in the consolidated financial
statements of Lindorff AB and Lock Lower Holding, respectively. See “Management Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Lindorff—Factors Affecting the_
_Comparability of Lindorff’s Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”_

Lock Topco AS was established on July 1, 2014. Lock Topco AS is a holding company created in
connection with the Prior Lindorff Acquisition, with no independent operations of its own. Lock Topco
AS’s only assets consist of its interest in the share capital of Lock Upper Holding AS (and indirectly
Lock Lower Holding and Lindorff AB), and intercompany receivables. Lock Topco AS does not have
any other material assets or external liabilities although it has €30 million in intercompany liabilities in
favor of Lock Lower Holding.

The preparation of the Issuer’s Financial Statements and Lindorff’s Financial Statements in accordance
with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. These standards also require
management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying accounting policies. The areas
involving a high degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are
significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in the Issuer’s Financial Statements and Lindorff’s
Financial Statements, as applicable.

**Segments, Service Lines and Geographic Regions**

The Issuer and Lindorff each include segmental results in their financial statements with the segments
defined in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments in each case.

Lindorff’s operating segments are considered from a product perspective: (i) debt purchasing, which
consists of mainly unsecured non-performing loans and receivables purchased by Lindorff; (ii) debt
collection, which consists of collection for various clients and on portfolios of loans and receivables,
as well as real estate servicing (“RES”); and (iii) other services, which consists of information, payment
and invoicing services. In addition, Lindorff also reports certain results by country. See Note 2.3 and
Note 5 to Lock Lower Holding’s Audited Financial Statements presented elsewhere herein.

The Issuer’s operating segments are comprised of the three geographical regions in which its clients
are located: (i) Northern Europe (including Denmark, Estonia, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway,
Poland and Sweden), (ii) Central Europe (including Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary,
Slovakia and Switzerland) and (iii) Western Europe (including Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Portugal,
Spain and the United Kingdom). Central and common expenses are spread across the geographical
regions in proportion to their purchasing power parity-adjusted revenues. In addition, the Issuer also
reports certain results by service offering, which is divided into two service lines: (i) Credit Management
Services (“CMS”), which includes collection services, credit information services and payment
services; and (ii) Financial Services, which predominantly includes purchased debt, as well as
payment guarantees and other financing services. See Note 2 to the Issuer’s Audited Financial
Statements presented elsewhere herein.

In order to combine the Issuer’s and Lindorff’s results by geographic region for purposes of presenting
certain pro forma financial results of the Company by segment, both the Issuer and Lindorff adjusted
their results by geographic region to conform to the following four geographic regions: (i) Northern
Europe (including Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and
Sweden), (ii) Central and Eastern Europe (including Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary,
Switzerland and Slovakia), (iii) Western Europe (including Belgium, France, Ireland and the United
Kingdom) and (iv) Southern Europe (including Italy, Portugal and Spain). The Company also presents
certain pro forma financial and other information by service line herein. For purposes of presenting this
_pro forma financial information, the Company defines its two service lines as (i) CMS (comprised of_
Lindorff’s debt collection products and products currently presented in Lindorff’s other services
segment, excluding payment services, and the Issuer’s CMS service offerings) and (ii) Financial
Services (comprised of Lindorff’s debt purchasing products and payment services, which is currently
presented in Lindorff’s other services segment, and the Issuer’s Financial Services service line). The


-----

presentation of _pro forma Company results by segment and service line is provided for illustrative_
purposes only, and the segments and service lines used for the preparation of these pro forma results
may not be reflective of future geographic region and service line reporting for the Company. See “—
_Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information” and “Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information of the_
_Company” for more information regarding the pro forma adjustments presented herein._

**LTM Financial Information**

This Offering Memorandum includes certain unaudited financial information for the twelve months
ended March 31, 2017. This financial information has been calculated, as the case may be, by:
(i) adding the Issuer’s historical results for the three months ended March 31, 2017, to the Issuer’s
historical results for the year ended December 31, 2016, and subtracting the Issuer’s historical results
for the three months ended March 31, 2016 (the “Issuer’s LTM Information”); (ii) adding Lock Lower
Holding’s historical results for the three months ended March 31, 2017, to Lock Lower Holding’s
historical results for the year ended December 31, 2016, and then subtracting Lock Lower Holding’s
historical results for the three months ended March 31, 2016 (“Lindorff’s LTM Information”); and
(iii) adding the unaudited _pro forma information for the three months ended March 31, 2017 to the_
unaudited pro forma information for the year ended December 31, 2016, and subtracting the unaudited
_pro forma information for the three months ended March 31, 2016 (the “Pro Forma LTM Information”_
and, together with the Issuer’s LTM Information and Lindorff’s LTM Information, the “LTM
**Information”). The LTM Information has been prepared solely for the purposes of this Offering**
Memorandum, is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting and has not been
audited or reviewed. It is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily representative of the
Issuer’s results of operations, or the results of operations of Lindorff, for any future period or the
Issuer’s financial condition at any future date.

**Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information**

The Transactions are expected to affect the future earnings, financial condition and cash flows of the
Issuer. To illustrate this effect, the Issuer has prepared the following unaudited _pro forma financial_
information (collectively, the “Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information”):

- unaudited pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2016 to illustrate the
effect that the Transactions might have had on the Issuer if they had been completed on January 1,
2016 for purposes of presenting an unaudited pro forma income statement for the period;

- unaudited pro forma financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2016, to illustrate
the effect that the Transactions might have had on the Issuer if they had been completed on
January 1, 2016 for purposes of presenting an unaudited _pro forma income statement for the_
period;

- unaudited pro forma financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2017, to illustrate
the effect that the Transactions might have had on the Issuer if they had been completed on
January 1, 2016 for purposes of presenting an unaudited _pro forma income statement for the_
period;

- unaudited pro forma financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2017, to illustrate
the effect that the Transactions might have had on the Issuer if they had been completed on
January 1, 2016 for purposes of presenting an unaudited _pro forma income statement for the_
period; and

- unaudited _pro forma financial information as of March 31, 2017, to illustrate the effect that the_
Transactions might have had on the Issuer if they had been completed on March 31, 2017 for
purposes of presenting an unaudited pro forma balance sheet as of this date.

The Unaudited _Pro Forma Financial Information was prepared based on the Issuer’s audited_
consolidated financial statements of and for the year ended December 31, 2016, the Issuer’s Interim
Financial Statements, Lock Lower Holding’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the


-----

year ended December 31, 2016 and Lock Lower Holding’s Interim Financial Statements. _Pro forma_
adjustments included only those adjustments described in “Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information
_of the Company—Basis of Preparation.” No adjustment was made to account for the intercompany_
liabilities of Lock Topco AS including the liability of €30 million in favor of Lock Lower Holding.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information has been included to describe a hypothetical situation,
has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and should be read in conjunction with the information
contained in “Selected Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data” and “Management
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Intrum Justitia” and_
“Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Lindorff,” the
Issuer’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016,
the Issuer’s Interim Financial Statements, Lock Lower Holding’s audited consolidated financial
statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 and Lock Lower Holding’s Interim
Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The Unaudited _Pro Forma_
Financial Information does not include all of the information required for financial statements under
IFRS and does not include a cash flow statement for any period.

Moreover, the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information may not necessarily reflect the Issuer’s actual
results of operations and/or financial condition if the Transactions had actually been completed on such
earlier date and such Unaudited _Pro Forma_ Financial Information should not be considered to be
indicative of the Issuer’s results of operations or financial condition for any future period. Furthermore,
the Unaudited _Pro Forma Financial Information does not reflect the effect that the disposal of the_
Carveout Business may have on the future earnings, financial conditions and cash flows of the Issuer.
See “—Divestment of the Carveout Business.” The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information has not
been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act,
applicable EU regulations, IFRS or any generally accepted accounting standards. Accordingly, potential
investors should not pay undue attention to the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information.

**Divestment of the Carveout Business**

The European Commission approved the Merger on June 12, 2017. The approval is conditional on the
divestment of the Carveout Business, and Nordic Capital, _i.e. the notifying party and majority_
shareholder of Lindorff, has committed to divesting the Carveout Business in accordance with certain
parameters and within the timeframe established by the European Commission. This Offering
Memorandum presents certain information relating to the estimated contribution of the Carveout
Business to certain pro forma or combined information of the Company (prior to giving effect to the
disposal of the Carveout Business) (the “Aggregated Carveout Business Information”) as of and for
the twelve months ended March 31, 2017. The Aggregated Carveout Business Information has been
derived from the management accounts or the internal information systems, as the case may be, of the
Issuer and Lindorff, as applicable, that management has used to estimate the potential impact on the
Company of divesting the Carveout Business. The Aggregated Carveout Business Information and the
accounting records upon which they are based have not been audited or reviewed by the independent
auditors of the Issuer or Lindorff nor have they been prepared in accordance with IFRS or any other
generally accepted accounting standards. The Aggregated Carveout Business Information is provided
with respect to certain limited income statement items and operating data and accordingly does not
include any information that would usually be included in a statement of income, statement of financial
position, statement of other comprehensive income, statement of cash flows or statement of changes
in equity, in each case prepared in accordance with IFRS. The Carveout Business comprises Lindorff’s
businesses in Denmark, Estonia, Finland and Sweden and the Issuer’s businesses in Norway. None of
the Issuer, Lindorff or either of their respective independent auditors have undertaken a comprehensive
analysis of the financial results or position of the Carveout Business as a separate entity or the
contribution of the Carveout Business or any component thereof to the financial results or position of
the Issuer, Lindorff or the Company as of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2017 or any other
date. Furthermore, the Aggregated Carveout Business Information is based on information derived
from the management accounts or internal information systems, as the case may be, of the Issuer and
Lindorff as of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2017 and the actual financial impact of
divesting the Carveout Business at the time of its sale may differ materially from estimates of this


-----

impact based on these sources. For all of these reasons, the ultimate effect of divestment of the
Carveout Business remains uncertain and potential investors should not give undue weight to
Aggregated Carveout Business Information when making their investment decision. Given this
uncertainty, the pro forma financial and other information presented herein has not been adjusted to
reflect divestment of the Carveout Business, unless otherwise indicated. The Company’s financial
position and results may be significantly affected by divestment of the Carveout Business. In addition,
the Company’s distribution of revenue, ERC and other financial and non-financial measures by country
and geographic region and service line presented in this Offering Memorandum may be significantly
affected by divestment of the Carveout Business. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Transactions.”_

**Non-IFRS Financial Measures**

In this Offering Memorandum, we present EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA (excluding NRIs), Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Further Adjusted EBITDA, as we
believe they are helpful to investors as measures of our operating performance and ability to service
our debt. These measures are not measures of financial performance under IFRS and should not be
considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other
measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS, and they may not accurately reflect our
performance, liquidity or our ability to incur or service debt. EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (excluding NRIs), _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and_ _Pro Forma_ Further
Adjusted EBITDA are used by management as indicators of our operating performance.

- EBITDA means profit and loss for the period before taxes, net financial items and depreciation
and amortization of non-financial assets.

- EBITDA margin represents EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.

- Adjusted EBITDA means profit and loss for the period before taxes, net financial items,
depreciation and amortization of non-financial assets, and amortization and revaluation of
purchased debt. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding back amortization and revaluation of
purchased debt to EBITDA.

- Adjusted EBITDA (excluding NRIs) means profit and loss for the period before taxes, net financial
items, depreciation and amortization of non-financial assets and amortization and revaluation of
purchased debt, further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain non-recurring items, see
“Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data of Intrum Justitia—Other Financial
_Information and Operating Data for Intrum Justitia” and “Summary Historical Consolidated_
_Financial and Other Data for Lindorff—Other Financial Information and Operating Data for Lindorff.”_

- _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA means Adjusted EBITDA (excluding NRIs) of the Issuer_
adjusted to give pro forma effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2016.
See “—Pro Forma Financial Information.”

- _Pro Forma Further Adjusted EBITDA means Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months_
ended March 31, 2017, further adjusted to: (i) include the Adjusted EBITDA (excluding NRIs)
contribution of Aktua to Lock Lower Holding (in an amount of €12.5 million (SEK 119 million
equivalent, calculated using an exchange rate of SEK 9.5117 to €1.00 which represents the
average monthly exchange rate for the twelve month period ended March 31, 2017)) for the two
months ended May 31, 2016, which has been derived from monthly management accounts,
representing the period for which the financial information of Aktua was not consolidated in
Lindorff’s LTM Information; (ii) include the Adjusted EBITDA (excluding NRIs) contribution of 1st
Credit to the Issuer (in an amount of £27.7 million (SEK 314 million equivalent, calculated using
an exchange rate of SEK 11.367 to £1.00 which represents the average monthly exchange rate
for the twelve month period ended March 31, 2017)) for the ten months ended January 31, 2017,
which has been derived from monthly management accounts, representing the period for which
the financial information of 1st Credit was not consolidated in the Issuer’s LTM Information; and
(iii) add certain anticipated cost synergies from the Merger after giving estimated effect to the


-----

disposal of the Carveout Business. See “Summary Consolidated Pro Forma Financial and Other
_Data of the Company—Pro Forma and Other Information of the Company” and “Summary—_
_Divestment of the Carveout Business.”_

For a reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (excluding NRIs) to profit and
loss for the period and/or net cash inflow/(outflow) from operating activities as presented in the Issuer’s
Financial Statements or Lindorff’s Financial Statements, as applicable, see “Summary Historical
_Consolidated Financial and Other Data of Intrum Justitia” and “Summary Historical Consolidated_
_Financial and Other Data of Lindorff.” For a reconciliation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma_
Further Adjusted EBITDA, see “Summary Consolidated Pro Forma Financial and Other Data of the
_Company” and “Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information of the Company.”_

The non-IFRS financial measures presented herein are not recognized measures of financial
performance under IFRS, but measures used by management to monitor the underlying performance
of our business and operations. In particular, the non-IFRS financial measures should not be viewed
as substitutes for revenue, other income, results from operating activities (EBIT), profit/(loss) for the
period, cash flows from operating activities at period end or other income statement or cash flow items
computed in accordance with IFRS. The non-IFRS financial measures do not necessarily indicate
whether cash flow will be sufficient or available to meet our cash requirements and may not be
indicative of our historical operating results, nor are such measures meant to be predictive of our future
results. EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (excluding NRIs), _Pro Forma_
Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Further Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you
should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for, an analysis of our results as reported under
IFRS. Some of these limitations are:

- they do not reflect cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or
contractual commitments;

- they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs;

- they do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service
interest or principal payments on debt; and

- although depreciation, amortization and impairment are non-cash charges, the assets being
depreciated and amortized will generally need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA, EBITDA
margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (excluding NRIs), Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and
_Pro Forma Further Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required_
for such replacements.

We have presented these non-IFRS measures in this Offering Memorandum because we consider
them to be important supplemental measures of our performance and believe that they are widely used
by investors comparing performance between companies. Since not all companies compute these or
other non-IFRS financial measures in the same way, the manner in which our management has chosen
to compute the non-IFRS financial measures presented herein may not be comparable with similarly
defined terms used by other companies.

This Offering Memorandum contains certain synergy estimates, among others, relating to cost
reductions and other benefits expected to arise from the Merger after giving estimated effect to the
disposal of the Carveout Business, as well as costs related to implementing such measures. The
estimates present the expected future impact of the Merger and the integration of Lindorff into Intrum
Justitia’s existing business after giving estimated effect to the disposal of the Carveout Business. Such
estimates are based on a number of assumptions made in reliance on the information available to us
and management’s judgments based on such information. The assumptions used in estimating the
synergies arising from the Merger after giving estimated effect to the disposal of the Carveout Business
are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic and
competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in the synergy benefit estimates. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions—
_Anticipated synergies from the Merger may not materialize.” The non-IFRS measures presented in this_
Offering Memorandum should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating

performance, cash flows or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with IFRS and
have not been prepared in accordance with SEC requirements, IFRS or the generally accepted
accounting principles in use in any other jurisdiction. The financial information included in this Offering
Memorandum is not intended to comply with the reporting requirements of the SEC and will not be
subject to review by the SEC. In making an investment decision, investors should rely upon their own
examination of the terms of the offering of the Notes and the financial information contained in this
Offering Memorandum.

**Other**

The Issuer’s Financial Statements are presented in Swedish kronor (“SEK”). Amounts included in the
Issuer’s Financial Statements that were not originally denominated in SEK have been translated into
SEK using the average exchange rate for the financial period with respect to the income statement and
the period-end exchange rate with respect to statement of financial position items.

Lindorff’s Financial Statements are presented in euros. Amounts included in Lindorff’s Financial
Statements that were not originally denominated in euro have been translated into euro using the
average exchange rate for the financial period with respect to the income statement and the periodend exchange rate with respect to statement of financial position items. Amounts included in the
Unaudited _Pro Forma Financial Information presented in SEK derived from Lindorff’s Financial_
Statements have been translated into SEK using the average of the monthly exchange rates for the
applicable period with respect to the income statement and the applicable period-end exchange rate
with respect to the statement of financial position, in each case published by Sveriges Riksbank, the
central bank of Sweden, which may differ from the exchange rate as of the date hereof and the Issue
Date.

For informational purposes only, certain financial information of the Issuer and the Company presented
in SEK for the twelve months ended March 31, 2017 has been converted to euro at an exchange rate of
SEK 9.5117 to €1.00, which represents the average Sveriges Riksbank Daily Reference Rate for the
twelve month period ended March 31, 2017, which may differ from the exchange rate as of the date
hereof and the Issue Date. For further discussion, see “Exchange Rates.”

**Key Operating Metrics**

In this Offering Memorandum, we present various key operating metrics. We believe that these metrics
are helpful in understanding our performance from period to period and facilitate comparison with our
peers. These metrics are not measures of financial performance under IFRS and should not be
considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other
measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS. The key operating metrics included in this
Offering Memorandum are defined as follows:

- **Average collection of forecasts: Average collection of forecasts means gross collections on**
purchased debt divided by the (latest) active forecast, on a rolling twelve-month basis.

- **Carrying value of purchased debt: The carrying value of purchased debt is the amount**
recognized in the balance sheet. The carrying value of each portfolio corresponds to the present
value of estimated future cash flows discounted by the applicable EIR. The carrying value of
purchased debt represents the aggregate carrying value of portfolios of purchased loans and
receivables of the Issuer, Lindorff or the Company, as applicable, as of the dates presented. With
respect to co-investment portfolios, only the proportionate share of the portfolio corresponding to
Lindorff’s or the Company’s investment, as applicable, is recorded on the balance sheet.

- **Collection cost ratio: Collection cost ratio means, in relation to debt purchasing, the cost to**
collect relative to gross collections.

- **Effective Interest Rate (“EIR”): EIR means under IFRS the effective interest rate that exactly**
discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial
instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial asset


-----

or financial liability. For the Issuer, Lindorff and the Company, as applicable, this means that the
EIR is set based on the ERC at the date of purchase and the portfolio’s purchase price.

- **Estimated Remaining Collections (“ERC”): ERC means the estimated remaining collections on**
purchased debt acquired by the Issuer and/or Lindorff, as applicable, plus, in Lindorff’s case, ERC
contributions from each of the portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables purchased
through co-investment agreements in proportion to Lindorff’s relative ownership interest in each
such portfolio. ERC is calculated as of a point in time, assuming no additional purchases are
made thereafter. These expectations are based on historical and current portfolio collection
performance data, and trends and assumptions about future debt collection rates. There can be
no assurances that such collections will be achieved within the specified time periods, or at all.
ERC is a measure that is also often used by other companies in the credit management industry.
However, it may be calculated differently by other companies. ERC is presented because it
represents an estimate of the anticipated future cash collections on our purchased debt at any
point in time, which is an important supplemental measure used by our management to assess
our performance, and underscores the cash generation capacity of the assets backing our
business. We use ERC as the business case forecast horizon when purchasing portfolios. We
also use it for accounting purposes and because it is used under the instruments or agreements
governing our indebtedness to monitor our performance when the lenders are providing funding
of portfolio purchases. In this Offering Memorandum we present ERC, which is our estimated
remaining debt collections on our purchased debt portfolios over an 180 month period. However,
for the purpose of the covenants under the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement,
ERC will be measured over an 84 month period. See “Description of the Notes.”

- **Gross cash-on-cash multiple: Gross cash-on-cash multiple means the actual gross collections**
to date, plus the ERC as of the same date divided by the total amount paid for the portfolio at the
date of purchase.

- **Gross collections on purchased debt: Gross collections on purchased debt means the total**
principal, interest, collection fees and legal fees received on portfolios that we own or, in the case
of debt purchased through co-investment agreements, a share of the aggregate gross collections
on purchased debt equal to Lindorff’s relative ownership interest in such purchased debt.

- **Purchased debt: Purchased debt consists of portfolios of delinquent consumer debts, loans,**
OTR and other receivables purchased at prices below the nominal receivable. As used in this
Offering Memorandum, “purchased debt” and “loans and other overdue receivables” may be
used interchangeably, as the context requires.

- **Return on purchased debt: For Lindorff, return on purchased debt means earnings on the**
purchased debt component of the business for the last twelve months, as a percentage of the
average carrying amount of the purchased debt item on the balance sheet. The average carrying
amount is calculated by adding the opening and closing balance for the last twelve months and
dividing by two.

For Intrum Justitia and the Company, return on purchased debt means earnings on the
purchased debt component of the business for the last quarter and annualized by multiplying
such amount by four, as a percentage of the average carrying amount of the purchased debt item
on the balance sheet. The average carrying amount is calculated by adding together the opening
and closing balance for the last quarter and dividing by two.

- **Segment earnings: Segment earnings is calculated on a segment basis and means the total**
operating revenue of the segment less the direct operating expenses attributable to the respective
segment.

- **Segment earnings margin: Segment earnings margin is calculated on a segment basis and**
means the segment earnings of the segment as a percentage of total operating revenue of the
respective segment.


-----

- **Service line earnings: Service line earnings is calculated on a service line basis and means the**
total operating revenue of the service line less the direct operating expenses attributable to the
respective service line. The Issuer includes depreciation and amortization of fixed assets among
operating expenses that are attributable to these service lines whereas Lindorff does not apportion
these expenses between its segments. For the purposes of presenting the Unaudited Pro Forma
Financial Information by service line for the Company, the Issuer’s approach has been followed.

- **Service line earnings margin: Service line earnings margin is calculated on a service line basis**
and means the service line earnings of the service line as a percentage of total operating revenue
of the respective service line.

- **Total collectible value on purchased debt: Total collectible value on purchased debt is**
calculated as the total principal plus interest and fees added to the receivable on purchased debt.

- **Total collectible value on third-party debt: Total collectible value on third-party debt means the**
total principal plus interest and fees added to the receivable on third-party debt.

### PRESENTATION OF INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA

This Offering Memorandum contains statistics, data and other information relating to markets, market
sizes, market shares, market positions and other industry data pertaining to our business and markets.
Unless otherwise indicated, such information is based on our analysis of multiple sources, including a
market study (the “Company Market Study”) Lindorff commissioned from a leading international third
party consultancy firm (the “Market Consultancy Firm”) and information otherwise obtained. Such
information has been accurately reproduced, and, as far as we are aware from such information, no
facts have been omitted which would render the information provided inaccurate or misleading. The
Company Market Study is based on primary interviews and field visits conducted with industry experts
and participants, secondary market research and internal financial and operational information
supplied by, or on behalf of, us. The Company Market Study was prepared in October 2016 and has
not been updated to reflect current market conditions.

Industry publications or reports generally state that the information they contain has been obtained
from sources believed to be reliable, but the accuracy and completeness of such information is not
guaranteed. We have not independently verified and cannot give any assurance as to the accuracy of
market data contained in this Offering Memorandum that were extracted or derived from these industry
publications or reports. Market data and statistics are inherently predictive and subject to uncertainty
and not necessarily reflective of actual market conditions. Such statistics are based on market
research, which itself is based on sampling and subjective judgments by both the researchers and the
respondents, including judgments about what types of products and transactions should be included
in the relevant market.

This Offering Memorandum also contains estimates of market data and information derived therefrom
that cannot be gathered from publications by market research institutions or any other independent
sources. Such information is prepared by us based on third-party sources and our own internal
estimates, including studies of the market that we have commissioned. In many cases there is no
publicly available information on such market data, for example from industry associations, public
authorities or other organizations and institutions. We believe that our estimates of market data and
information derived therefrom are helpful in order to give investors a better understanding of the
industry in which we operate as well as our position within the industry. Although we believe that our
internal market observations are reliable, our own estimates are not reviewed or verified by any external
sources. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding the industry or similar data presented
herein, such data involves risks and uncertainties and is subject to change based on various factors,
including those discussed under the headings “Presentation of Financial and Other Information” and
“Risk Factors” in this Offering Memorandum.

Statements regarding the Company’s position as the leading credit management company in Europe
and the largest pan-European credit management company are based on reported information among
European peer companies for a number of metrics (such as revenue, EBITDA and carrying value of
purchased debt) and information in the Company Market Study.

_Statements. You should read carefully the entire Offering Memorandum to understand our business, the_

_Carveout Business on the Company. See “—Divestment of the Carveout Business.”_

**Overview**

Upon completion of the Merger, we will be the leading credit management provider in Europe by
revenue, EBITDA and carrying value of purchased debt, with operations in 23 European countries and
a leading position in a majority of those countries. Intrum Justitia and Lindorff each provide a balanced
and integrated mix of services across the entire credit management value chain, including financial
services, and each company has a longstanding commitment to fair collection. Following the Merger,
we will benefit from greater scale of our operations and complementary sector expertise in debt
originated by the trade sector and the financial institutions sector, respectively. Using the existing
expertise of Intrum Justitia and Lindorff, we will provide:

- **_Credit Management Services (“CMS”). We employ tailored debt collection strategies and_**
solutions to maximize cash flow streams from loans and other overdue receivables for clients who
have decided to outsource their debt collection function. On a pro forma combined basis for the
twelve months ended March 31, 2017, we would have generated net revenue of SEK 6,922 million
(€728 million equivalent) from CMS, excluding revenue generated from portfolios of loans and
other overdue receivables that we own. As part of our CMS services, Lindorff has leading
capabilities in alternative solutions, such as carve-outs, which involves taking over the in-house
collection platform of financial institutions clients and conducting debt collection on behalf of the
financial institutions under a long-term contract. Lindorff also provides real estate servicing
(“RES”), which involves servicing of loans related to properties and other services related to the
security/property owned by its clients in Spain.

In addition to, and generally in combination with, collection services, we provide clients with a
wide range of value-added services, prior to loans and receivables becoming overdue, including
customer and credit information and analysis on individuals and companies across Europe to
help our clients assess their potential customers’ payment capacity, data extraction and
modelling, selection and scoring of potential customers, and a full suite of services relating to
accounts receivable, including invoicing, reminders and account ledger services.

- **_Financial Services. We offer a range of financial services. In particular, we purchase portfolios of_**
secured and unsecured loans and other overdue receivables from our clients for a portion of the
nominal value, which we then service using our in-house debt collection function, with a few
exceptions. Following the purchase of the defaulted receivables, our long-term debt collection
measures commence, aimed at helping consumers become debt-free as we help them reduce
their debt in a respectful manner, for example through installment plans that take account of each
consumer’s payment capacity. On a _pro forma_ combined basis for the twelve months ended
March 31, 2017, we would have generated net revenue of SEK 5,934 million (€624 million
equivalent) from Financial Services and, on a combined basis as of March 31, 2017, the ERC of
our portfolios of loans and overdue receivables would have been SEK 46,704 million
(€4,892 million equivalent), with a total collectible value on purchased debt of SEK 405,190
million (€42,444 million equivalent). As part of our Financial Services offering, we also provide
factoring, payment guarantees and e-commerce services.


-----

We believe that the combination of debt collection and purchasing has been and will be key to Intrum
Justitia’s and Lindorff’s, and our continued, success. The range of services helps attract and retain
clients and increases the breadth and depth of collectible data, in turn supporting the creation of
tailored collection strategies and development of analytical capabilities to enable more accurate
pricing of portfolios. Operating across Europe and with a balanced business model also gives us
investment optionality as we can allocate resources across our platform and jurisdictions to the
opportunities that we find most attractive. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2017, our pro forma
net revenue and Pro Forma Further Adjusted EBITDA was SEK 12,856 million and SEK 9,254 million,
respectively (€1,352 million and €973 million equivalent, respectively). See “Summary Consolidated
_Pro Forma Financial and Other Data of the Company—Pro Forma and Other Information of the_
_Company” and “Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information of the Company.”_

As discussed further below, to address competition concerns raised by the European
Commission following its investigation of the Merger, Nordic Capital has committed to divesting
the Carveout Business. See “—Divestment of the Carveout Business.”

**Our Strengths**

We believe that our business will benefit from a number of key strengths, including:

**_Europe’s leading credit management company_**

_The largest European credit management company._

We will be the largest European credit management company by revenue, EBITDA and carrying value
of purchased debt and will be significantly larger than the second largest credit management company
in Europe. Our EBITDA on a pro forma combined basis for the twelve months ended March 31, 2017
would have been SEK 4,787 million (€503 million equivalent). We believe our combined size will give
us several benefits. In particular, our combined experience will favorably impact our ability to
competitively price portfolios in our debt purchasing activities and develop optimal collection
strategies, which we believe will have a positive impact on our revenue and efficiency. Additionally, we
believe the increase in size of the Company should allow us to better absorb fixed costs, including
those related to regulatory and legal compliance and IT, which should further benefit our margins.

_Market leading position in several European countries._

We will be present in 23 European countries, which we believe is more than any of our European
competitors. Based on our internal estimates, we believe we will hold a leading position in the majority
of countries in which we operate. We believe our expanded geographic footprint combined with strong
local market positions is a competitive advantage which will further enhance our ability to follow our
clients across markets and deepen client relationships.

_Leading position in the European financial institutions segment for debt purchasing._

Based on the Company Market Study, we believe that we will hold a leading position among credit
management providers with respect to debt purchasing from financial institution clients in Europe. We
believe that the financial institutions segment in Europe represents one of the most attractive segments
of the credit management market. Financial institutions are the largest originator of debt and we believe
European bank NPL stock amounted to approximately €1.1 trillion in 2015, according to the Company
Market Study. The financial institutions segment also offers attractive economics with long durations
and earnings visibility. We have a long track record of collecting on NPLs and have built long-term
relationships with European financial institutions. During the three years ended December 31, 2016,
Intrum Justitia and Lindorff would have acquired NPLs with a total collectible value on purchased debt
of SEK 65 billion and €7.4 billion, respectively, from European financial institutions. These portfolio
purchases have been complemented by three strategic M&A transactions in the last three years, all of
which involved target companies focused on the financial institutions segment. For the year ended
December 31, 2016, 66% of our net revenue on a pro forma combined basis in our Financial Services
service line was generated by debt purchased from financial institutions.


-----

_Leading position in the European trade segment for CMS and debt purchasing._

We believe, based on the Company Market Study, that we will hold a leading position among credit
management providers in the trade segment in Europe. We believe that the trade segment is an
attractive segment of the credit management market and that our position in both this segment and
the financial institutions segment helps support and sustain our overall stability. European overdue
trade receivables (“OTR”) stock amounted to approximately €70 billion in 2015, according to the
Company Market Study. The trade segment compliments the financial institutions segment, as it offers
a relatively stable and high volume of stock with short duration. In many of the markets in which we will
operate, we believe OTR flow will remain at high levels in the short-term, driven by increased
household spending, a structural shift towards a higher proportion of invoice payments and increased
outsourcing of CMS operations. During the three years ended December 31, 2016, Intrum Justitia and
Lindorff acquired non-financial institution stock with a total collectible value on purchased debt of SEK
20 billion and €557 million, respectively, from European telecommunications, utilities and other trade
companies.

**_Europe’s most diversified credit management company_**

_Complete service offering._

In addition to having the widest European geographic footprint, we will have the market’s broadest
service offerings across the credit management value chain, including financial services, enabling us
to operate as a “one-stop shop” for our clients. Our predominant activities are in debt collection and
debt purchasing. Additionally, within our CMS service line, we offer value-added services before loans
and receivables become overdue, including information, invoice and payment services, which are an
important source of origination for the debt purchasing and debt collection businesses and for data
collection. Our broad product and service offering will be complemented by our ability to offer flexible
solutions to our clients, including by leveraging Lindorff’s market-leading capabilities in the carve-outs
of financial institutions’ in-house collection units, co-investment structures and, more recently,
provision of RES.

_Ability to acquire and service several types of loans._

Historically, Intrum Justitia and Lindorff have focused on unsecured consumer debt originated by
financial institutions and overdue trade receivables originated by the trade sector. Both companies
have also increased their activities in the secured consumer debt market segment. Lindorff further
expanded its footprint and capabilities in this market segment through the Aktua Acquisition during
2016, which also marked its entry into the Spanish RES segment.

**_Strategic balance between highly complementary CMS and Financial Services businesses_**

_Data analytics._

Our broad service offering allows us to collect data through the credit management value chain and
extract data synergies to continuously strengthen our data analytics capabilities. We consider data
analytics and business intelligence to be important in driving optimized collection strategies and
accurately and competitively pricing portfolios that we bid for. For example, over time, Intrum Justitia
has collected depersonalized data on over 177 million claims across both debt collection, within its
CMS service line, and debt purchasing, within its Financial Services service line, and estimates that it
has a data warehouse consisting of over one billion events, such as payments and actions taken,
associated with those claims.

_Operational synergies._

The combined scale we achieve through the breadth of our service offering as well as our
pan-European footprint provides us with economies of skill and scale. As an example of our scale, for
the year ended December 31, 2016, on a combined basis, we had approximately SEK 5,333 million
(€563 million equivalent) in average monthly collections (with approximately 87% in our CMS service
line). Operational synergies are important drivers of efficient operations through standardized


-----

processes given the scalable nature of our business model. For example, Intrum Justitia’s and
Lindorff’s EBITDA margins have increased by 2 percentage points and 7 percentage points,
respectively, from the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2016.

_Financial complementarity._

With our integrated and balanced business model, we also benefit from the financial complementarity
between our two service lines, whereby capital-light earnings from the CMS service line (SEK 2,012
million (€212 million equivalent) on a _pro forma combined basis for the year ended December 31,_
2016) generate cash which can be utilized for portfolio purchases and deleveraging.

**_Diversified origination platform_**

_Debt collection supports the tendering process in the debt purchasing component of our business._

When bidding for portfolios from our existing CMS clients, we are able to leverage our existing
business relationship, accurately and competitively price portfolios that we find attractive, and offer an
attractive value proposition to clients, informed by our knowledge of, and provision of other services
to, the client.

_Long-term relationships with our CMS clients._

Intrum Justitia and Lindorff both have a track record of maintaining long-term relationships with their
largest clients and have also historically achieved high levels of repeat purchases from existing
customers, which we believe evidences the strength of our product and service offerings. For Intrum
Justitia, out of its five largest clients in the CMS service line, four have had a relationship with Intrum
Justitia of more than 10 years, three have had a relationship of more than 15 years and the relationship
with Intrum Justitia’s largest client extends beyond 25 years. In the Nordic region, some of Lindorff’s
largest revenue contributors and longest relationships were established in the 1980s and, with respect
to Lindorff’s top 10 clients in each market, the average length of each client relationship in third-party
debt collection services is over nine years.

_Carve-outs with long-term contracts._

In recent years, Lindorff has completed several carve-out transactions, typically with financial
institutions, with respect to clients’ in-house collection units, including entering into long-term servicing
agreements with the financial institution. For instance, the average remaining contract life from the
recent carve-outs of Banco Sabadell (in 2014) and Banco Mare Nostrum (entered into in 2013 and
expanded in 2015), the two largest carve-out transactions entered into by Lindorff, stretches over seven
years.

_Large number of repeat and small purchases._

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2017, on a pro forma combined basis, we would have had SEK
1,055 million (€111 million equivalent) of purchases of loans and other overdue receivables under
forward flow contracts, providing visibility on new business origination. Additionally, over the same
period, Intrum Justitia had SEK 467 million of small purchases, with each portfolio less than €2 million
in size, and Lindorff had €82 million of small purchases, with each portfolio less than €5 million in size.
On a combined basis, the Company’s average purchased debt claim size would have been
approximately SEK 23,600 as of March 31, 2017.

_Significant supply of NPLs in the market._

Based on the Company Market Study, we believe that the European bank NPL stock amounted to
approximately €1.1 trillion in 2015, representing more than 2.5x the 2007 levels. Coupled with
increased regulatory pressure, based on the Company Market Study, we expect that NPL sales, as a
base case scenario, will increase by 5-8% per year between 2015-2020 and that this could increase
further should banks decide to accelerate deleveraging of their balance sheets. At the same time,
based on the Company Market Study, we expect the European bank NPL stock to remain stable at


-----

approximately €1 trillion over the next three years, as a base case, due to increases in lending and
continued new NPL formation. See “Industry Overview—Financial institution generated debt.”

_Pan-European presence, multi-sector and transaction structure capabilities._

Our pan-European presence, with operations in 23 countries, will enable us to efficiently allocate
capital to opportunities with the best risk/reward profiles. We have capabilities with respect to financial
institutions as well as across multiple trade sectors, including utilities, telecommunications and retail,
which allows flexible capital deployment in debt purchasing and enhances our ability to identify and
take advantage of trends in various sectors in the CMS service line. Furthermore, we will benefit from
Lindorff’s co-investment structure. During the course of 2015 and 2016, Lindorff participated in
co-investments in the Baltics and Spain and entered into a co-investment partnership with CarVal and
AlbaCore to allow it to swiftly capitalize on market opportunities. Pursuant to Lindorff’s co-investment
agreement with CarVal and AlbaCore, CarVal and AlbaCore, as co-investment partners, announced an
intention to deploy up to a total of €350 million in aggregate and Lindorff announced an intention to
deploy a variable amount determined on a case-by-case basis towards the acquisition of unsecured
NPL portfolios in Europe. These co-investment arrangements will provide us with the ability to acquire
larger, mixed portfolios due to risk sharing with co-investment partners and also increase the breadth
of our origination platform by leveraging the network of our co-investment partners. We expect to target
minority holdings in the range of 20-50% in debt purchasing co-investment structures, while also
providing third-party debt collection services for 100% of the portfolio. As a result, in addition to debt
purchasing revenues, such co-investment arrangements act as a capital-light growth accelerator of
third-party debt collection with a lower level of upfront capital investment.

**_Track record of continuous operational excellence, innovation and efficiency improvements_**

We will benefit from Intrum Justitia and Lindorff’s shared culture, focused on innovation and
operational improvement to drive financial performance. Intrum Justitia and Lindorff have each
undertaken a range of initiatives that historically have improved their respective collection and margins,
and that we believe will further improve the performance of our business. These include, among other
things:

- standardization: consolidated infrastructure among subsidiaries and reduced the number of
physical collection sites, virtual collection systems and IT systems;

- data management: centralized data pools and implemented data cleansing techniques and
analytical tools which support enhanced decision-making;

- digitalization: invested in self-service consumer and client portals, facilitating timely and
transparent communication and proactive management of credit management services;

- automation: deployed sales-based robotics with advanced software, capable of replicating
human activities, exploring the application of artificial intelligence to operational processes; and

- shared services: consolidated and near-shored shared services and continue to evaluate
expansion to additional service centers.

In addition, we expect to benefit from significant cost synergies following the Merger. For further details,
see “—Our Strategy—Continue to drive profitability through operational excellence and realization of
_operational synergies.”_

**_Strong embedded risk culture_**

Intrum Justitia and Lindorff benefit from well-defined and multi-layered risk management frameworks
and a rigorous approach to maintaining pricing discipline that we believe will support profitability
through active and effective management of pricing, reputational and regulatory risks throughout our
investment decision-making process. Given the breadth of Intrum Justitia’s and Lindorff’s experience
throughout the credit management value chain, we will have access to comprehensive databases of
purchased and serviced debt. Combined with data analysis capabilities, we will be able to take a


-----

centralized approach to forecasting and pricing that is supported by specialist local input, ensuring
strong cross-organizational evaluation of portfolio pricing. Our data capabilities will also facilitate more
efficient debt collection strategies through data analytics and cross-learning. In addition, the threetiered risk management approach of Intrum Justitia and Lindorff will help ensure that this sophisticated
pricing information is used in an investment decision-making context that focuses on compliance and
maintaining strong internal controls. A focus on risk management and compliance are woven into the
structure of Intrum Justitia and Lindorff from the local level (where each of Intrum Justitia and Lindorff
has its first line of defense) to the internal and independent external risk control and auditing functions
carried out at the executive and board levels.

We believe this focus on pricing discipline and risk management has historically enabled Intrum
Justitia and Lindorff to consistently outperform their respective forecasted collections. Neither Intrum
Justitia nor Lindorff have had any negative net revaluations of their respective portfolios in the past
three years. Additionally, Intrum Justitia and Lindorff collected 106-113% and 98-113%, respectively, of
forecasted cash flows for each quarter from debt purchasing from January 1, 2014 through March 31,
2017.

**_Resilient financial performance with strong cash generation_**

_Long track record of stable revenue growth and expanding margins._

Intrum Justitia and Lindorff have each shown a stable trend of revenue growth and margin expansion.
For example, Intrum Justitia’s net revenue grew 8% per annum between December 31, 2014 through
December 31, 2016 and its EBITDA margin improved by 2 percentage points, from 33% in the year
ended December 31, 2014 to 35% in the year ended December 31, 2016. Over the same period,
Lindorff’s net revenue grew 17% per annum and its EBITDA margin improved by 7 percentage points,
from 32% to 39%. We believe there is potential for further top-line growth based on favorable market
supply dynamics and our capital deployment flexibility. Additionally, we believe our pro forma EBITDA
margin will be positively impacted by our operating leverage, ongoing cost savings initiatives and
realization of synergies associated with the Merger, including anticipated cost synergies from the
Merger estimated at SEK 560 million (€59 million equivalent) per annum after full implementation and
giving effect to the disposal of the Carveout Business and additional revenue synergies.

_Stable cash flows in CMS, with capital-light investment._

Intrum Justitia’s and Lindorff’s third-party debt collection services, which require relatively limited
investment, generate stable cash flows, supported by long-term client relationships. As of March 31,
2017, we manage, on a combined basis, third-party debt with a combined total collectible value on
third-party debt of SEK 344 billion (€36 billion equivalent). Furthermore, in connection with Lindorff’s
recent entry into several carve-out transactions, typically with financial institutions, Lindorff has entered
into long-term servicing agreements. Overall, we tend to experience strong client loyalty and limited
attrition, in part due to system integrations with clients, which can make it unattractive for clients to
switch credit management company.

_Significant cash flows embedded in portfolios of purchased debt._

As of March 31, 2017, our ERC on a combined basis would have been SEK 46,704 million
(€4,892 million equivalent). Intrum Justitia and Lindorff have a long track record of outperforming their
initial collection forecasts and extending collection periods beyond 15 years. Furthermore, we strive to
maintain an accurate valuation of the portfolios on our balance sheet and neither Intrum Justitia nor
Lindorff have had any negative net write downs of their respective portfolios in the last three years.

_Strong cash generation with efficient conversion of profit into cash flow._

For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, Intrum Justitia used SEK 143 million, SEK
135 million and SEK 142 million (representing 4%, 4% and 5%), respectively, of its Adjusted EBITDA
on capital expenditures other than capital expenditures related to the purchase of debt portfolios. Over
the same period and excluding the 2014 Spanish Acquisition, Lindorff used €21 million, €45 million


-----

and €32 million (representing 5%, 14% and 12%), respectively, of its Adjusted EBITDA on capital
expenditures other than capital expenditures related to the purchase of debt portfolios. For the twelve
months ended March 31, 2017, total investments in purchased debt by the Company on a pro forma
combined basis would have been SEK 7,026 million (€739 million equivalent). For additional
information on our cash conversion rates, see “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations of Intrum Justitia—Overview” and “Management Discussion and_
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Lindorff—Overview.”_

**_Proven management team with a clear strategic agenda_**

_Strong leadership of experienced senior management supported by specialist teams in central_
_functions and local markets._

We are managed by a strong executive team comprising individuals with many years of relevant
experience and providing leadership across all functional areas of the business. For example, Intrum
Justitia’s CEO and the named CEO of the Company, Mikael Ericson, was formerly Head of International
Banking at Danske Bank A/S, one of the leading banks in the Nordic region, and CEO of Carnegie
Investment Bank AB. In addition, Intrum Justitia’s CFO and the named CFO of the Company, Erik
Forsberg, has been CFO of Intrum Justitia for over five years and has previously held positions as CFO,
group treasurer and business controller at several companies. A skilled team of managers operating
our central functions and assisting in the execution of our strategy at group level supplements our
executive team. In addition, our regional and country managers bring significant industry expertise and
local input to drive execution of our strategic agenda.

**Our Strategy**

Intrum Justitia and Lindorff share similar and complementary strategic priorities. We will build on the
existing strategic priorities of the two companies and leverage their respective complementarity.

**_Maintaining and strengthening our position as the leading credit management company in_**
**_Europe and leveraging our well-balanced and integrated business model_**

We are the largest and most diversified credit management company in Europe, with a leading position
in the majority of countries in which we operate and the ability to serve clients across the full credit
management value chain and across various asset classes. We have a clear objective to remain client
centric, evolve with our clients and continue to meet their needs. Maintaining an integrated, balanced
and flexible business model is a key feature of achieving this objective.

**_Continue to drive profitability through operational excellence and realization of operational_**
**_synergies_**

We have a long history of commitment to operational excellence and track record of continuously
improving our margins and we have identified several initiatives to further drive efficiency
improvements and our profitability going forward, including:

- _Operational integration and portfolio management. We intend to deploy the best practices of_
Intrum Justitia and Lindorff across our operations. We will seek to leverage scale and skill
advantages and experience in data management, analytics and digitalization to drive collection
performance excellence across our debt purchasing and debt collection businesses. We see
strong value potential from further focus on active portfolio management.

- _Focus on pricing discipline, risk management and compliance. As a result of strict pricing_
discipline, institutionalized investment processes and operational improvements, neither Intrum
Justitia nor Lindorff have had any negative net revaluations of their respective portfolios in the
past three years. Additionally, Intrum Justitia and Lindorff have collected 106-113% and 98-113%,
respectively, of forecasted cash flows for each quarter from debt purchasing from January 1, 2014
through March 31, 2017. We intend to continue to employ a high level of underwriting discipline
in order to maintain forecasting accuracy and to ensure that we only acquire portfolios that


-----

generate returns that meet our investment return criteria. In addition, we will seek to maintain our
competitive advantage through continued early adoption of regulation and best-in-class
compliance and risk management procedures.

- _Realize operational synergies. We expect to benefit from significant cost synergies from the_
Merger that are estimated at SEK 560 million (€59 million equivalent) per annum after full
implementation and giving effect to the disposal of the Carveout Business. Management
estimates that it will take approximately three years for the full impact of the cost synergies to be
realized. A detailed assessment has been performed involving external strategy consultants and
operational staff within both Intrum Justitia and Lindorff. The assessment identified cost synergies
arising mainly from optimization of operations centers, consolidation of administrative and
support functions, harmonization of IT systems and application development/maintenance, and
increased scale in procurement. These estimates reflect the proposed divestment of the Carveout
Business and consequently differ from the estimated cost synergies that have been previously
announced. Cost synergy implementation costs are estimated at approximately SEK 725 million
(€76 million equivalent), the majority of which are expected to be incurred in the first two years
following the closing of the Merger. In addition to cost synergies, the assessment also identified
certain revenue synergies from the combination of business intelligence operations and data sets,
cross-selling of complementary offerings to existing clients, improved cross-border coverage of
international clients and transfer of best practices.

**_Continue balanced growth in areas of expertise_**

We believe that we are well-positioned for balanced and diversified growth across asset classes and
sectors, based on our integrated and balanced business model. Key features of our balanced growth
strategy include:

- _Continued focus on acquisitions of unsecured NPLs. Unsecured consumer NPL sales volumes_
have increased in recent years as banks increasingly prefer selling debt to clean up their balance
sheets and to focus on their core business, and increasingly trust debt collection agencies to
handle their debt. Based on the Company Market Study, we expect this trend to continue and
estimate that annual unsecured NPL sales in Europe will grow from €3.3 billion in 2015 to an
average annual level of €3.7 billion for the period between 2017 and 2020. We will continue to
deploy capital within the unsecured NPL space.

- _Expansion in secured NPLs and real estate services. Secured NPLs represent a large portion of_
the NPL market. The acquisition of Aktua, one of the leading credit management companies in
the secured NPL segment in Spain, in June 2016 significantly strengthened our secured
consumer capabilities and added RES capabilities to our service offering. We see growth
potential from leveraging and exporting Aktua’s capabilities in secured and RES markets across
many of the geographies in which we operate.

- _Co-investments. In the debt purchasing segment, we see a pipeline in terms of the number and_
the size of investment opportunities available, which may outpace our on-balance sheet
investment appetite. We will consider flexible capital deployment initiatives, such as
co-investment structures, which will provide us with the ability to acquire larger, mixed portfolios
due to risk sharing with co-investment partners. Co-investments also increase the breadth of our
origination platform by leveraging the network of our co-investment partners. We aim to leverage
Lindorff’s experience in co-investments and continue to use co-investment structures to increase
our operating leverage.

- _Geographic expansion. We have a strong track record of expansion into new markets and have_
established operations in 23 countries. Over the last few years, Intrum Justitia and Lindorff have
each entered into new geographies through strategic transactions, including carve-outs and
bolt-on acquisitions. Going forward, we will continue to proactively evaluate opportunities to enter
new markets. For example, in April 2017, Intrum Justitia acquired Top Factoring SRL, a purchased
debt company in Romania. When entering new markets, our strategy is based on a cautious first


-----

entry: we start small and increase our investments as our insight and experience in a particular
market increases. Moreover, we often strengthen our local knowledge and databases through
business acquisitions and/or carve-out transactions (as we have previously done in the United
Kingdom, Spain, Poland and Italy). For example, one method we employ to enter a new market
involves acquiring a company with existing debt servicing capabilities and data, operating the
company to develop further knowledge and data capabilities and then leveraging this data and
market knowledge to price and purchase debt in the newly entered market.

- _SME. We believe small and midsized enterprises represent an attractive debt collection services_
client segment, and we aim to increase our presence in this market through both organic growth
in the markets in which we offer these services and through acquisitions. To that end, Intrum
Justitia acquired a company in Denmark and a company in Spain that focus on SME debt
collection during the fourth quarter of 2016.

**_Commitment to highest ethical standards and fair collection practices_**

We are dependent upon relationships characterized by trust with clients, authorities and society as a
whole. In order to achieve the necessary level of trust, we must act with professionalism, expertise and
high ethical standards at all levels of our operations. Our internal standards are applicable to all
employees. These standards mandate that all employees are expected to always work within the law,
have sound moral principles and behave in an upstanding and sincere way. We have implemented a
centrally coordinated compliance monitoring program, which evaluates and assesses compliance with
legal, regulatory and industry best practices, as well as our internal standards. The continued
commitment to the highest ethical and fair collection practices is paramount to our ability to be the
leading credit management company in Europe.

**_Medium-term target_**

In the medium-term, we aim to achieve net debt in relation to Adjusted EBITDA (excluding NRIs) of
approximately 3.0 times. In preparing this medium-term target, we have in general assumed that there
will be no material changes in existing political, legal, fiscal, market or economic conditions or in
applicable legislation, regulations or rules (including, but not limited to, accounting policies and
accounting treatments), which, individually or in the aggregate, would be material to our results of
operations; and that we will not become party to any litigation or administrative proceeding that might
have a material impact on us of which we are currently unaware. Our actual results could differ
materially from this target as a result of many factors, including, but not limited to, those described
under “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.”

**The Transactions**

**_The Merger_**

On November 13, 2016, Intrum Justitia and Nordic Capital entered into the Merger Agreement,
pursuant to which, as of the Completion Date, Intrum Justitia acquired Lindorff’s entire issued share
capital in exchange for newly issued shares in Intrum Justitia (the “Merger”). The new shares were
issued to the Lindorff Shareholders, and the number of new shares is equal to 45% of the total number
of shares outstanding in the Company after issue.

**_The Refinancing Transactions_**

The Issuer is hereby offering €3,014 million (equivalent) in aggregate principal amount of the Notes.
The gross proceeds from the offering of the Notes were deposited in the applicable Escrow Accounts.
The Escrowed Proceeds were released on the Completion Date.

On the Issue Date, the Issuer entered into the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement with, _inter alios,_
Swedbank AB (publ) as facility agent and security agent (the “Revolving Credit Facility Agreement”).
The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement became effective on the Completion Date and established a
total commitment of €1,100 million under the Revolving Credit Facility, replacing the Intrum Justitia


-----

Existing Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Revolving Credit Facility
_Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”_

On or about the Completion Date, the Issuer used the Escrowed Proceeds along with certain
borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility to:

(i) redeem the Lindorff Existing Notes;

(ii) repay outstanding borrowings under:

(a) the Lindorff Existing Revolving Credit Facility, apart from unfunded guarantees of
€10.5 million (equivalent), which will be rolled over into the Revolving Credit Facility;

(b) the Lindorff Bilateral Facility Agreements;

(c) the Aktua Facility Agreements (the indebtedness described in (i) to (ii) above, collectively,
the “Lindorff Existing Debt”;

(iii) repay outstanding borrowings under the Intrum Justitia Existing Revolving Credit Facility; and

(iv) pay certain costs, fees, premiums and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions.

The transactions described above are collectively referred to as the “Refinancing Transactions.” See
“Use of Proceeds.”

**Divestment of the Carveout Business**

The European Commission approved the Merger on June 12, 2017. The approval is conditional on the
divestment of Lindorff’s businesses in Denmark, Estonia, Finland and Sweden as well as the Issuer’s
businesses in Norway (collectively, the “Carveout Business”). The businesses that comprise the
Carveout Business constitute the entire business of Lindorff or the Issuer, as applicable, in that
jurisdiction. Nordic Capital has committed to divesting the Carveout Business in accordance with
certain parameters and within the time permitted by the European Commission.

We anticipate selling the Carveout Business as a single unit in a competitive process. However, there
can be no assurance as to how long the sale process may take, whether we will be able to find a willing
buyer for the Carveout Business on a timely basis or at all or the proceeds that the Issuer may receive
from the sale. If we are unable to find a willing buyer for the Carveout Business within the allotted time,
a divestiture trustee will be appointed to sell the Carveout Business at no minimum price and there can
be no assurance that any such sale will be made on acceptable terms and at a price equal to what
would have been paid if the Carveout Business was not sold pursuant to such a process. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions—We may not be able to divest the Carveout Business in a_
_timely manner, on acceptable terms, at a reasonable price or at all.”_

Based on information derived from management accounts and internal information systems, as the
case may be, of the Issuer and Lindorff, we estimate that the Carveout Business represented
approximately 17% of our combined ERC, approximately 13% of our pro forma combined EBITDA and
approximately 14% of our _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as of and for the twelve months ended_
March 31, 2017. The estimated net revenue of the Carveout Business based on management accounts
represented approximately 14%, 17% and 12% of our _pro forma combined total net revenue, net_
revenue from Financial Services and net revenue from CMS, respectively, for the twelve months ended
March 31, 2017.

After giving effect to the disposal of the Carveout Business, we expect to benefit from significant cost
synergies from the Merger that are estimated at SEK 560 million (€59 million equivalent) per annum
after full implementation, which is expected in approximately three years, representing a reduction in
previously announced total estimated cost synergies of 30%. In addition, implementation costs relating
to such cost synergies are estimated at approximately SEK 725 million (€76 million equivalent), the
majority of which are expected to be incurred in the first two years following the closing of the Merger,


-----

representing a reduction in previously announced total estimated implementation costs of 27.5%. Any
estimates regarding the effect of divestment of the Carveout Business, including the Aggregated
Carveout Business Information, and its effects on previously announced cost synergy and
implementation cost estimates, are subject to significant uncertainties and limitations. See
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Divestment of the Carveout Business” and “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions.”_

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information and other combined information that gives pro forma
effect to the Transactions presented in this Offering Memorandum includes amounts associated with
the Carveout Business and does not give effect to the expected disposal of the Carveout Business. See
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Divestment of the Carveout Business.”

**Recent Developments**

**_Acquisitions_**

In April 2017, Intrum Justitia acquired Top Factoring SRL, one of the leading companies for purchased
debt in Romania. The purchase price was €25.7 million, attributable mainly to a diversified portfolio of
overdue receivables.

In April 2017, Intrum Justitia acquired the remaining 42% shareholding in IJCOF Corporate SAS, a
French company whose operations involve collection from corporations.

**_Distribution to shareholders_**

On June 29, 2017, the annual general meeting of the Issuer adopted the Board’s proposal for a
dividend to be paid of SEK 9 per share, representing a distribution to shareholders of SEK 651,129,534.
The dividend is expected to be distributed by Euroclear Sweden on July 6, 2017.

Other shareholders


Intrum Jus��a Subsidiaries

in certain assets of such subsidiaries. The terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement require that the obligations
under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by subsidiaries of the Issuer which, together with the Issuer, represent
not less than 80% of the consolidated EBITDA and consolidated gross assets of the Issuer and its subsidiaries (in each case
calculated in accordance with the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions).
Accordingly, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to these subsidiaries’ guarantees under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and effectively subordinated to indebtedness incurred under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to the
extent of the value of property securing the Revolving Credit Facility. See “—The Transactions” and “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement” and “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

(7)  As of March 31, 2017, the Issuer had SEK 1,360 million outstanding under the Intrum Justitia Existing Commercial Paper
Program. The Intrum Justitia Existing Commercial Paper Program rank equally in right of payment with the Notes. See
“Description of Other Indebtedness—Intrum Justitia Existing Commercial Paper Program.”

(8)  Under the Lindorff Existing Loan Note Issuance Deed, Lindorff Payment Services AB may incur up to €50 million in external

_entitled “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Selected Historical Consolidated Financial and Other_
_Data,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation of_
_Intrum Justitia,” as well as the Issuer’s Financial Statements._

_This section includes certain unaudited financial information for the twelve months ended March 31,_
_2017. This LTM Information has been calculated by adding the Issuer’s historical results for the three_
_months ended March 31, 2017 to the Issuer’s historical results for the year ended December 31, 2016,_
_and subtracting the Issuer’s historical results for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The LTM_
_Information has been prepared solely for the purposes of this Offering Memorandum, is not prepared_
_in the ordinary course of our financial reporting and has not been audited or reviewed. It is for illustrative_
_purposes only and is not necessarily representative of the Issuer’s results of operations for any future_
_period or its financial condition at any future date._

_We present below certain non-IFRS financial measures such as EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted_
_EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (excluding NRIs) because we believe they are important supplementary_
_measures and that they are widely used by investors comparing performance between companies._
_Since not all companies compute these non-IFRS financial measures in the same way, the manner in_
_which our management has chosen to compute the non-IFRS financial measures presented herein may_
_not be comparable with similarly defined terms used by other companies. These measures are not_
_measures of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to other_
_indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in_
_accordance with IFRS, and they may not accurately reflect our performance, liquidity or our ability to_
_incur or service debt._

_In this section, we also present various key operating metrics. We believe that these metrics are helpful_
_in understanding our performance from period to period and facilitate comparison with our peers._
_These metrics are not measures of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as_
_alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of_
_performance derived in accordance with IFRS._


_For informational purposes only, certain financial information of the Issuer presented in SEK has been_
_converted to euro at the applicable Sveriges Riksbank Daily Reference Rate as described further in_
_“Exchange Rates.” This rate may differ from the exchange rate as of the date hereof and the Issue Date._

### SUMMARY HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA OF LINDORFF

_The following section presents summary historical consolidated financial data of Lindorff AB and Lock_
_Lower Holding AS as of the dates and for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with_
_the sections entitled “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Selected Historical Consolidated Financial_
_and Other Data,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of_
_Operation of Lindorff” as well as Lindorff’s Financial Statements._

_This section includes certain unaudited financial information for the twelve months ended March 31,_
_2017. This LTM Information has been calculated by adding Lindorff’s historical results for the three_
_months ended March 31, 2017 to its historical results for the year ended December 31, 2016, and_
_subtracting its historical results for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The LTM Information has_
_been prepared solely for the purposes of this Offering Memorandum, is not prepared in the ordinary_
_course of our financial reporting and has not been audited or reviewed. It is for illustrative purposes only_
_and is not necessarily representative of Lindorff’s results of operations for any future period or its_
_financial condition at any future date._

_We present below certain non-IFRS financial measures such as EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted_
_EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (excluding NRIs) because we believe they are important supplementary_
_measures and that they are widely used by investors comparing performance between companies._
_Since not all companies compute these non-IFRS financial measures in the same way, the manner in_
_which our management has chosen to compute the non-IFRS financial measures presented herein may_
_not be comparable with similarly defined terms used by other companies. These measures are not_
_measures of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to other_
_indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in_
_accordance with IFRS, and they may not accurately reflect our performance, liquidity or our ability to_
_incur or service debt._

_In this section, we also present various key operating metrics. We believe that these metrics are helpful_
_in understanding our performance from period to period and facilitate comparison with our peers._
_These metrics are not measures of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as_
_alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of_
_performance derived in accordance with IFRS._

as a percentage of the average carrying amount of the purchased debt item on the balance sheet. The average carrying
amount is calculated by adding together the opening and closing balance for the last twelve months period and dividing
by two.

### SUMMARY CONSOLIDATED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA OF THE COMPANY

_The following section present summary consolidated pro forma condensed consolidated financial_
_information and other data from the “Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information of the Company” and_
_should be read in conjunction with the sections entitled “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Selected_
_Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial_
_Condition and Results of Operation of Intrum Justitia,” Management’s Discussion and Analysis of_
_Financial Condition and Results of Operation of Lindorff” as well as the Issuer’s Financial Statements_
_and Lindorff’s Financial Statements._

_The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information presented below was prepared based on the Issuer’s_
_audited consolidated financial statements of and for the year ended December 31, 2016, the Issuer’s_
_Interim Financial Statements, Lock Lower Holding’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and_
_for the year ended December 31, 2016 and Lock Lower Holding’s Interim Financial Statements. Pro_
_forma adjustments included only those adjustments described in “Unaudited Pro Forma Financial_
_Information of the Company—Basis of Preparation.”_

_The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information has been included to describe a hypothetical situation_
_and has been prepared for illustrative purposes only. The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information_
_does not include all of the information required for financial statements under IFRS and does not include_
_a cash flow statement for any period. Future results may vary significantly from the results reflected_
_because of various factors, including those discussed in “Risk Factors.”_

_This section includes certain unaudited financial information for the twelve months ended March 31,_
_2017. This LTM Information has been calculated by adding the unaudited pro forma information for the_
_three months ended March 31, 2017 to the unaudited pro forma information for the year ended_
_December 31, 2016, and subtracting the unaudited pro forma information for the three months ended_
_March 31, 2016. The LTM Information has been prepared solely for the purposes of this Offering_
_Memorandum, is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting and has not been audited_
_or reviewed. It is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily representative of our results of_
_operations for any future period or its financial condition at any future date._

_We present below certain non-IFRS financial measures such as Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro_
_Forma Further Adjusted EBITDA because we believe they are important supplementary measures and_
_that they are widely used by investors comparing performance between companies. Since not all_
_companies compute these non-IFRS financial measures in the same way, the manner in which our_
_management has chosen to compute the non-IFRS financial measures presented herein may not be_
_comparable with similarly defined terms used by other companies. These measures are not measures_
_of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of_
_our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance_
_with IFRS, and they may not accurately reflect our performance, liquidity or our ability to incur or service_
_debt._

_In this section, we also present various key operating metrics on a combined basis. We believe that_
_these metrics are helpful in understanding our performance from period to period and facilitate_
_comparison with our peers. These metrics are not measures of financial performance under IFRS and_
_should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows_
_or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS._

_For informational purposes only, certain financial information of the Company presented in SEK has_
_been converted to euro at the applicable Sveriges Riksbank Daily Reference Rate as described further_
_in “Exchange Rates.” This rate may differ from the exchange rate as of the date hereof and the Issue_
_Date._

### RISK FACTORS

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information in this_
_Offering Memorandum, you should carefully consider the following risk factors before purchasing the_
_Notes. The occurrence of any of the events discussed below could materially adversely affect our_
_business, financial condition and results of operations. The risks described below are not the only ones_
_we believe we are exposed to. Additional risks that are not currently known to us, or that we currently,_
_based on our regular risk assessment, consider to be immaterial, could significantly impair our business_
_activities and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of_
_operations. If any one of these events occurs, the trading price of the Notes could decline and we may_
_not be able to pay interest or principal on the Notes when due, and you could lose all or part of your_
_investment. The order in which these risks are presented is not intended to provide an indication of the_
_likelihood of their occurrence or of their severity or significance._

_This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that are based on assumptions_
_and estimates and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from_
_those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including, but not_
_limited to, the risks described below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

**Risks Related to Our Industry and Business**

**_The economic conditions in the markets in which we operate affect our business._**

We are exposed to the economic, market and fiscal conditions in the markets in which we operate and
any positive or negative developments regarding these conditions. Should any such negative
developments occur, we may not be able to perform debt collection at levels consistent with our
historic levels due to the inability of customers to make payments, at the same levels or at all, as was
the case during the 2008-2010 economic downturn. Adverse economic conditions may also reduce the
propensity of debt originators to sell overdue receivables as sale prices may be unfavorable during
such periods. Furthermore, if the economy suffers a material and adverse downturn for a prolonged
period of time that, in turn, increases the unemployment rate and/or impacts interest rates and the
availability of credit, there may not be the anticipated demand for our payment services. Each of these
developments could have a negative effect on our financial results. In addition, should the level of
inflation increase, the real-term carrying value of purchased debt may decrease.

There can be no assurances that economic conditions will improve in the markets in which we operate,
or that the net effect of any change in economic conditions will be positive. An improvement in the
economic conditions in the markets in which we operate could impact our business and performance
in various ways, including reducing the number of attractive portfolio opportunities that are available
for purchase and increasing the competitiveness of the pricing for portfolios that we purchase and debt
collection services that we offer. There can be no assurances that our business and results of
operations will develop positively in this environment. Conversely, while adverse economic conditions
and increased levels of unemployment may lead to higher default rates on claims, which in turn may
increase the stock of portfolios available for us to purchase and increase the amount of loans and other
overdue receivables possessed by our debt collection clients, there can be no assurances that such
potential increase in the amount of debt available to purchase and service will compensate for the
adverse effects of an economic downturn. Accordingly, any of these developments could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We are active in competitive markets and may be unable to continue to successfully compete_**
**_with businesses that may offer more attractive prices, benefit from less expensive funding or_**
**_pursue lower return requirements than us._**

The European credit management industry is currently, and following the Merger will continue to be,
fragmented and consists of several thousand companies with varying profiles. We face competition
from new and existing debt collection providers, other purchasers of portfolios of overdue loans and
other overdue receivables and debt originators that manage their own portfolios rather than


-----

outsourcing or selling them. This competition includes, but is not limited to, competition on the basis
of price. New market entrants and existing competitors may offer more attractive pricing levels, both
for debt collection contracts and for debt portfolio purchases, and accept lower returns in order to gain
or increase market share. There can be no assurances that this price competition will not result in us
paying higher prices for portfolios that we purchase or charging less for our debt collection or other
payment services, each of which could decrease our margins and have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations or financial condition.

We face bidding competition in our acquisition of debt portfolios. We believe that successful bids are
awarded based on price and a range of other factors, including service, compliance, reputation and
relationships with the sellers of debt portfolios. Some of our current competitors, and potential new
competitors, may have more effective pricing and collection models, greater adaptability to changing
market needs or more established relationships in our industry and geographic markets than we do.
Moreover, our competitors may elect to pay prices for debt portfolios that we determine are not
economically sustainable and, in that event, our volume of debt portfolio purchases may be
diminished. There can be no assurances that our existing or potential sources of debt portfolios will
continue to sell their portfolios at recent levels or at all, or that we will continue to offer competitive bids
for debt portfolios.

Some of our current competitors, and potential new competitors, may have less expensive funding or
lower return requirements than we will have after the Merger. Additionally, in the future we may not have
the financial resources to offer competitive bids for portfolio purchases and debt collection contracts.
There can be no assurances that we will be able to develop and expand our business or adapt to
changing market needs as well as our current or future competitors. Any of these developments could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_There may be insufficient supply of, or appropriately priced, debt available for our credit_**
**_management and financial services. Any decrease in our ability to purchase debt portfolios or_**
**_provide credit management services could materially and adversely affect our business._**

The demand for our credit optimization, payment and collection services and availability of debt
portfolios at prices that generate profits depends on a number of factors, some of which are outside of
our control, including:

- the level of consumer spending;

- the availability of credit to consumers and consumers’ borrowing appetite, which is driven by a
number of factors, including heightened regulation of the credit card and consumer lending
industry, changing credit origination strategies, tighter lending criteria introduced by consumer
credit providers and general economic conditions, including increased interest rates;

- the level of non-performance on consumer debt portfolios and the proportion of such portfolios
that are written off by originators, which also in turn may affect the availability of credit to
consumers identified above;

- sales of debt portfolios by originators, which could be jeopardized by a change in accounting
policies or practices, the consolidation of credit card issuers or increased sophistication in
internal collection efforts;

- potential concerns that the small value received for defaulted debt portfolios as a percentage of
their total collectible value may not outweigh the potential reputational risks or required
management attention associated with selling defaulted debt portfolios;

- negative publicity or a loss of trust in our industry, whether due to the failure of one or more of our
competitors to meet their legal or regulatory obligations or otherwise;

- increased government regulation of the circumstances in which originators, especially regulated
entities, have a right to collect on debt; and

- the macroeconomic environments of the countries in which we operate.


-----

Originators may develop technological tools that could override the advantages we believe we
currently possess in terms of tracing technology and customer profile development. If originators
choose to perform more of their credit optimization, invoicing and debt collections internally as a result
of these data quality improvements, the demand for our credit management services and volume of
debt portfolio sales or the quality of underlying debt sold could decrease and, consequently, we may
not be able to buy the type and quantity of receivables at prices consistent with our historical return
targets. In addition, there could be a reduction in the availability of debt portfolios sold early in the
financial difficulty cycle and that have had little or no exposure to collections activity. This “fresh” debt
typically has higher collection expectations, because less work has been applied to the assets to
obtain customer payments, and a reduction in this type of debt portfolios would results in a
corresponding increase in the total share of more mature debt, collection of which typically is more
challenging and requires more effort.

If we are unable to purchase portfolios from originators at appropriate prices or lack the resources to
purchase portfolios, or if one or more originators stop or decrease their demand for our credit
management services or their sales of portfolios due to one of the factors listed above or any other
factors, we could lose a potential source of income which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_A significant amount of our revenue is generated from clients active within the financial services_**
**_industry._**

Lindorff and Intrum Justitia have derived, and we believe that, following the Merger, we will continue to
derive, a significant portion of our revenue from clients active within the financial services industry. For
the year ended December 31, 2016, on a pro forma basis financial institutions accounted for 66% of
the Company’s revenue generated from Financial Services and 46% of the Company’s revenue
generated from CMS. Concerns exist within the Eurozone with respect to individual macro
fundamentals on a country by country basis. Adverse economic conditions and uncertainties,
including any fines or penalties on European financial institutions, and any potential resulting failures
or consolidations of financial institutions, may adversely affect us by significantly reducing our client
engagements. Additionally, adverse economic conditions could lead to a reduction in the propensity
of financial institutions to lend to customers in the markets in which we operate, as was the case during
the global financial crisis (2008-2010). Adverse economic conditions may lead to a reduced supply of
debt available for us to perform debt collection on or fewer opportunities for us to enter into forward
flow agreements, as well as negatively affecting customers by reducing disposable income levels or
otherwise impairing their ability to fulfil their payment obligations. Any changes in the volume of
business derived from clients active within the financial services industry could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_The United Kingdom’s exit from the EU may adversely impact our business, results of operations_**
**_and financial condition._**

Following the United Kingdom public referendum on June 23, 2016 to leave the EU, the government
of the United Kingdom has served notice under Article 50 of the Treaty of the EU, pursuant to which
the United Kingdom has a two year period to agree to the terms of its withdrawal prior to leaving the
EU. This has led to concerns with respect to the overall stability of the EU and the United Kingdom and
the suitability of a single currency to appropriately deal with specific fiscal management and sovereign
debt issues in individual Eurozone countries. If the United Kingdom and the EU are unable to negotiate
acceptable withdrawal terms or if other EU member states pursue withdrawal, barrier-free access
between the United Kingdom and other EU member states or among the European economic area
overall could be diminished or eliminated. The exit of the United Kingdom or any other member state
from the EU, and/or the departure from the euro by one or more Eurozone countries, or, in more
extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro entirely, could lead to a reduction in
market confidence and a weakening of European financial institutions. A deterioration in political and
economic conditions could result in increased unemployment rates, increased short- and long-term
interest rates, consumer and commercial bankruptcy filings, and a decline in the strength of national


-----

and local economies. This could impact the growth of the British economy in particular, which we have
recently re-entered through the 1st Credit Acquisition, and the EU generally, and consequently our
financial condition and results of operations.

**_Errors in our collection process or other operational matters or negative attention relating to the_**
**_credit management industry in general, or to us in particular, could have a negative effect on our_**
**_business and reputation._**

Our ability to accurately collect debt and treat customers fairly is critical to our business and our
reputation. Our reputation is important to maintaining our relationships with current and potential
clients, especially financial institutions, and regulators. The following events, among others, may have
a negative effect on our reputation and/or our financial results: negative media publicity relating either
to us or the wider credit management industry; allegations of unethical or improper behavior by us or
third parties we use in the collection process; inability to collect debts on an accurate and timely basis;
failure to respect and treat customers fairly; failures in our collection and data protection processes;
the actions of third parties that we engage in the debt collection process; IT platform, in particular IT
security, failure; or other operational issues, litigation, regulatory restrictions, investigations, fines or
enforcement actions.

The collection of debt, particularly historic debt, involves complex interpretations and calculations of
contractual terms that may vary by client and/or country, which may impact the calculation of
customers’ resulting payment obligations and the collection strategies we employ. There can be no
assurances that the inherent complexity of debt calculation and historical inaccuracies will not result in
any issues in the future.

Lindorff has recently partnered and entered into co-investment arrangements with financial investors
that lack debt collection capabilities in the purchase of large debt portfolios, and we may continue to
enter such arrangements in the future. In such cases the co-investor typically retains the majority of the
investment and, as a result, is able to control the management of the investment venture. In 2015,
Intrum Justitia established an e-commerce financing company, Avarda AB, through a joint venture with
TF Bank, pursuant to which TF Bank has a 51% shareholding. We may have limited insight into and
ability to control the actual governance of the co-investments or joint ventures and we are therefore
subject to reputational and other risks related to the actions of the co-investors or co-venture partners,
as applicable, that are beyond our control.

Any of the foregoing events could result in financial liability or reputational damage and could
jeopardize our relationships with our clients, our ability to establish new client relationships, have a
negative impact on a customer’s willingness to pay a debt owed to us or to our clients, diminish our
attractiveness as a counterparty or lead to increased regulations of the credit management industry,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We depend on the continued willingness and ability of our clients to offer their portfolios for sale_**
**_and outsource their credit management services._**

We depend on the willingness and ability of our clients to continue to engage us to provide credit
management and financial services. Some factors that may influence the willingness and ability of our
clients to engage us to provide such services include, but are not limited to, the strength of our
reputation, regulatory pressures our clients face and the value proposition that we offer. Our business
would be adversely affected if our clients decide to reduce or discontinue the outsourcing of their credit
optimization, invoicing and debt collection or sales of portfolios or if the actual growth of levels of
outsourcing and sales is lower than we expected. In addition, our future revenue may be limited if
companies who do not currently outsource their debt collection or sell portfolios continue to manage
their portfolios in-house. There can be no assurances that the demand for our services will increase or
remain the same, and a decrease in demand for our services could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations or financial condition.


-----

**_We operate in a variety of jurisdictions and must comply with applicable laws, regulations,_**
**_licenses and codes of practice across all jurisdictions. Changes to the regulatory or political_**
**_environments in which we operate may negatively affect our business._**

_General_

We are subject to regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws and regulations
regarding our listing on Nasdaq Stockholm, data protection, debt collection, debt purchasing,
consumer credits, payment services, enhanced consumer protection and anti-money laundering and
terrorist financing at the national and supranational level. See “Regulatory Overview.” As we increase
our focus on certain business areas, such as secured loans or offering credit rescheduling agreements
(instalment plans), we become subject to additional regulatory requirements, including with respect to
anti-money laundering and verifying ownership of underlying assets. There can be no assurances that
our policies and procedures will prevent breaches of applicable laws and regulations or that our
investigations will identify such breaches in a timely manner or at all. Any such delay or failure could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Adverse
regulatory developments under the laws and regulations to which we are subject could expose us to
a number of risks. In addition, from time to time we identify weaknesses in our internal policies,
procedures and controls. We cannot assure you that in the future we will identify such weaknesses or,
where we do, remedy any such weaknesses in a timely manner or at all. Any such delay or failure could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

In a number of the markets in which we operate, including, in particular, the Czech Republic, Hungary,
Italy, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, and the UK, the regulation of financial undertakings is in all material
respects similar to the rules applicable for banks (including in respect of capital adequacy
requirements). As a consequence, these financial undertakings may be subject to new or amended
legislation from the EU applicable to banks, including new or amended capital requirements and
liquidity requirements. Such new or amended legislation and/or amended interpretation could, under
certain circumstances, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial
conditions.

Supervisory authorities in each country in which we operate may determine that we do not fully comply
with, are in violation of, or in the past have violated applicable rules, regulations or administrative
guidelines. If our policies and procedures are deemed not to be in compliance, or are deemed not to
have previously been in compliance, with relevant legal requirements or applicable legal requirements
or applicable laws, regulations or administrative guidelines, this could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

_Data protection_

We are subject to various regulatory requirements regarding data protection in the jurisdictions in
which we operate. Such regulatory requirements differ from country to country. In the past, regulatory
authorities have imposed fines on certain of our subsidiaries for non-compliance with data protection
regulations and we cannot assure you that similar fines will not be imposed in the future. The
imposition of any such fines or any other sanctions by regulatory authorities may have negative
consequences which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or
financial condition. In particular, if it turns out that any business activity we conduct is non-compliant,
such business activity may in principle be ordered to be stopped until the breach is cured. Changes
to data protection laws and regulations, or changes to their interpretation by data protection authorities
and courts, may reduce our operational flexibility and limit our ability to collect, retain or use our
customer data to price portfolios and create efficient debt collection strategies. On April 27, 2016, the
regulation on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on
the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection
Regulation, the “GDPR”) was adopted by the European Parliament and the European Council. The
GDPR will be directly applicable in all member states on May 25, 2018, and replaces Directive
95/46/EC and current national data protection legislation, and is also expected to be implemented in
the EEA countries with effect from the same date. The GDPR significantly changes the EU/EEA data


-----

protection landscape, including strengthening of individuals’ rights, stricter requirements on
companies processing personal data and stricter sanctions with substantial administrative fines. The
GDPR also offers data subjects the option to let a privacy organization litigate on their behalf, including
collecting the potential damages. It is expected that the new regime will impose a substantially higher
compliance burden on the credit management industry and potentially impair our ability to use
customer data, for example by restricting our ability to create customer profiles. In addition, if any of
the information or customer data that we use were to become public, including as a result of a change
in governmental regulation, or if the countries where we operate were to introduce measures that have
the effect of facilitating the tracing of customers, or if the current data processing restrictions were to
change such that credit market participants could access credit information before the purchase of
portfolios, or if the current data processing restrictions were to change such that we would be
prohibited from using customer data in the manner or to the extent in which it is currently used, we
could lose a competitive advantage and our business could be negatively affected. Intrum Justitia and
Lindorff are each currently assessing the full impact of the GDPR on their respective businesses and
reviewing existing rules, policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the GDPR once it
becomes effective. However, there can be no assurance that Intrum Justitia, Lindorff or the Company
will be successful in adjusting operations to ensure such compliance. Any failure to comply with the
GDPR once it becomes effective could result in sanctions, penalties or other negative consequences
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

_Statutes of limitation_

In most of the countries in which we currently have local operations, we are able to extend the statutes
of limitation on historic debt claims by taking legal actions or notifying the customer or otherwise
interrupting the limitation period. Some of the countries in which we operate have in recent years
changed the statutes of limitation for certain debt including by limiting the ability to extend or interrupt
the limitation period, or have discussed doing so. There can be no assurances that we would be
successful in adjusting our operations to these or other regulatory changes in these jurisdictions.

_Consumer protection_

The credit management industry could be subject to increased scrutiny due to local political factors
and developments, which could lead to changes in laws and regulations. The area of consumer credit
has recently come under increased regulatory focus by national governments. For instance, in early
2016, caps on interest rate and penalties or sanctions for defaulted loans or total cost of credit were
introduced in the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and, in 2014, Slovakia. In particular, the
Polish Parliament adopted wide-ranging amendments to the local consumer credit act, anti-trust and
interest rate laws in August 2015, which came into effect in March 2016. Such amendments introduced
a cap on credit costs imposed on consumers. In Finland, a cap on the effective annual interest rate for
consumer loans with a principal value below €2,000 was introduced in 2013. Such legislation may also
be introduced in other jurisdictions and such restrictions can materially affect the consumer credit
market since lenders derive a large portion of their profits from credit costs.

Stricter regulations regarding instalment plans have also been enacted or imposed by court ruling in
some countries. In the Netherlands, for example, a Supreme Court ruling in June 2014 held that
telecom consumers party to an agreement in which a “free” phone is provided are protected by laws
and regulations relating to payment by instalments and consumer credit. As a result, at the option of
the consumer, such agreements may be declared null, wholly or partially. Though the effects of this
ruling on our business cannot yet be fully determined, the collection rates on debt originating from
clients that are telecom providers may decline and our existing books may need to be revalued.
Further, there may exist potential for former debtors to reclaim amounts paid in the past, whether
individually or through consumer rights organizations. As a result of the Dutch Supreme Court ruling,
Intrum Justitia is party to a number of legal proceedings with certain of its customers relating to the
enforceability of receivables invalidated as a result of the ruling and Intrum Justitia’s obligation to pay
such customers for the assignment of such receivables. See “Business—Intrum Justitia: Legal and
_Administrative Proceedings.” There can be no assurance that the impact of these regulations, or others_


-----

like them enacted or imposed in other jurisdictions, will not impede our ability to conduct our
operations result in further litigations and have a negative impact on our business.

_Debt collection_

Licensing requirements for debt collection services differ from market to market. Many markets have a
licensing requirement and supervision of compliance. In December 2016, the European Court of
Justice (Third Chamber) ruled that a debt collection agency which concludes, on behalf of a lender, a
rescheduling agreement for an unpaid credit, but which acts as a credit intermediary only in an
ancillary capacity, must be regarded as being a credit intermediary and is not subject to the obligation
to provide the consumer with pre-contractual information. Following the ruling, some countries in the
EU have required debt collection companies that offer instalment plans to hold a consumer credit
license so as to be bound by the relevant EU directive. Such license requirements have already been
imposed in a few countries. Although large incumbent credit management providers, such as us, tend
to be better placed to comply with a high regulatory burden, stricter regulations in general may
increase our compliance burden and operating costs. Any temporary or permanent revocation of our
debt collection licenses by the licensing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have
a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Many of the
countries in which we operate have also implemented regulations providing limitations on costs for
debt collection and duties of disclosure to consumer customers.

Customers may become subject to insolvency or debt reorganization proceedings which may delay or
prevent the enforcement of the claims transferred to us. Collection of unsecured debt claims in the
event of bankruptcy or insolvency is generally limited by means of the funds available for distribution
from the insolvent estate. For further discussion of the effects regulation has on our business, see
“Regulatory Overview.”

**_A failure by the Company to comply with applicable laws, regulations, licenses and codes of_**
**_practice or failure of any of our employees to comply with our internal policies and procedures_**
**_may negatively affect our business._**

From time to time, we may receive inquiries from regulatory authorities and it is our practice to
cooperate with such inquiries. We are also subject to regular audits by the regulatory authorities in
various countries where we operate. An adverse outcome of any such investigation or other inquiries
from regulatory authorities may result in:

- the institution of administrative, civil or criminal proceedings;

- sanctions and the payment of administrative fines and penalties, including potential suspension
or revocation of regulatory licenses depending on the severity and scale of any regulatory issues;

- changes in personnel, management or board of directors;

- our inability to conduct business due to the loss of our regulatory license or restrictions or
conditions being placed on our activities;

- increased review and scrutiny of our services by our clients, regulatory authorities and others; and

- negative media publicity and reputational damage.

Individual employees may act against our policies or instructions and either inadvertently or
deliberately violate applicable law and regulations, including competition and anti-corruption laws and
regulations by engaging in prohibited activities such as price fixing or colluding with competitors
regarding markets or clients, or breaching our internal policies. In addition, because we delegate a
number of operational responsibilities to our subsidiaries and our local managers retain substantial
autonomy regarding the management of our operations in their markets, we may face an increased
likelihood of some or all of the risks described above occurring. Our internal governance policies and
instructions may prove to be ineffective and, even if they are effective, there can be no assurance that
we will not experience incidents of accounting or operating irregularities, accounting misstatements or


-----

the risks described above. Such actions have occurred in the past and, if such actions were to occur
in the future, these may harm our reputation and, if we are held responsible, the resulting
administrative fines and other sanctions (civil or criminal) could be substantial. Any of these
developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial
condition.

Lindorff identified potential breaches of internal rules and procedures related to its marketing and
entertainment spending, incurrence of certain other cash expenses and the entry into certain third
party agreements in one of its subsidiaries. Following an internal review Lindorff identified internal
policy breaches by relevant senior employees. The conduct in question relates mainly to certain
expenditures (partly via external vendors) during the year ended December 31, 2014, and the first
quarter of 2015. Lindorff’s ongoing investigation so far indicates that the amounts in question totaled
up to approximately €3 million over the period in question. The managers in question have since been
dismissed and such dismissals have been contested by these managers and are subject to court
proceedings. In the event that the High Court of Justice of Madrid declares our dismissal of the former
managers as unfair, we could be liable for an amount of approximately €2.8 million.

Furthermore, the companies we seek to acquire in the future or the employees of such companies may
not operate in accordance with the law, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to detect
and/or remedy any such non-compliance before an acquisition of such a company is complete.
Acquiring other businesses is a core component of our business strategy, and each of Intrum Justitia
and Lindorff have incurred expenses associated with legal non-compliance among companies they
have acquired in the past. For example, in connection with Intrum Justitia’s acquisition of its Dutch
subsidiary, Buckaroo BV, and Lindorff’s acquisition of its Polish subsidiary, Casus Finanse SA, each
company undertook lengthy investigations and incurred expenses associated with investigating and
remedying violations of applicable law by employees of the acquired companies. While thorough due
diligence is conducted for each acquisition, it is not always sufficient to identify certain concealed
instances of unlawful behavior.

Compliance with the regulatory framework requires dedicated time and resources. Failure to comply
with applicable laws, regulations and rules, or our failure to comply with a contractual compliance
obligation, could result in investigations and enforcement actions, licenses that we need to do
business not being renewed, being revoked or being made subject to more onerous or
disadvantageous conditions, fines or the suspension or termination of our ability to conduct
collections. In addition, such failure to comply or revocation of a license, or other actions by the
Company may damage the reputation of our clients. Damage to our reputation, whether because of a
failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or internal rules, or revocation of a license or any
other regulatory action or our failure to comply with a contractual compliance obligation, could deter
vendors, particularly large financial institutions, which represent a significant proportion of our clients
and vendors, from choosing us as their debt purchasing provider. Any of these developments could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Our operations in multiple markets expose us to local risks in a number of European markets._**

Following the Merger, we will have local operations in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark,
Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway,
Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Our business is
subject to local risks due to our operations in multiple European markets, including multiple national
and local regulatory and compliance requirements relating to labor, licensing requirements, consumer
credit, data protection, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and terrorist financing and other
regulatory regimes, potential adverse tax consequences, antitrust regulations, an inability to enforce
remedies in certain jurisdictions and geopolitical and social conditions in certain sectors of relevant
markets. While entering new markets, we could face additional risks, including incurring start-up losses
for several years due to lower levels of business, ramp-up and training costs, the lack of expertise and
loss of key employees in such markets, the lack of adequate and available management teams to
monitor and integrate these operations, unfavorable commercial terms and difficulties in maintaining


-----

uniform standards, control procedures and policies. Any negative impact caused by the foregoing risks
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In
addition, as we expand into new jurisdictions, our business will be subject to applicable laws,
regulations and licensing requirements in those new jurisdictions, which may be different or more
stringent than the jurisdictions in which we currently operate. Moreover, if we expand our operations
further internationally, including into emerging markets, we will be subject to additional risks, including
political and economic risks and conditions being generally less predictable than in countries with
more developed institutional structures.

**_We are subject to risks associated with our contracts for debt collection services, including our_**
**_ability to correctly assess pricing terms and the potential early termination or a reduction in the_**
**_volume of claims we service._**

The profitability of our debt collection services will generally depend upon our ability to successfully
calculate prices by taking into consideration all economic factors and our ability to manage day-to-day
operations under these contracts. Under most of our debt collection contracts we do not get paid
unless a customer begins paying on a claim and we may be unable to accurately predict the costs or
identify the risks associated with these contracts or the complexity of the services, which may result in
lower than expected margins, losses under these contracts or even the loss of clients. Our contracts
for debt collection services also subject us to penalty clauses, benchmark clauses, extraordinary
termination clauses, and change of control provisions. If we are unable to satisfy the terms of our
contracts then we could potentially have contracts terminated and lose clients and revenue. A number
of our long-term debt service agreements (including some of those entered into or acquired as part of
carve-out transactions and the Aktua Acquisition) are subject to early termination rights on the part
of the customer which, if exercised, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations or financial condition.

Many of our debt collection contracts have a stated term, typically one to two years, and, in some
cases, termination clauses permitting the client to cancel the contract at the client’s discretion following
the expiration of an agreed notice period. There can be no assurances that our clients will not exercise
their rights to terminate their contracts prior to expiration or that we will be successful in negotiating
new contracts with clients as such contracts expire. In addition, we are also exposed to unforeseen
changes in the scope of existing contracts, including prices or volumes that may occur as a result of
any changes in the general business or political landscape of our clients. Most of our debt collection
contracts do not have volume commitments and a client can eliminate or reduce the volume of claims
they outsource to us for debt collection without formally terminating the contract. We may have
disputes or disagreements with our clients as to the level of services we have agreed to provide or
contract terms. The potential effects of these risks may increase as we enter into larger contracts. If we
are unable to fulfil our obligations under our contracts for any reason, we risk the loss of revenue and
fees under that contract, the potential loss of a client and significant harm to our reputation. Any of our
contracts could become more costly than initially anticipated, and as a result, we may experience
significant increases in our operating costs and/or potential litigation. Further, we may experience
delays in integrating with our existing operations any businesses that we acquire or carve-out
transactions involving collection units that we complete. Any of these developments could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_The value of our existing portfolios may deteriorate, or we may not be able to collect sufficient_**
**_amounts on our portfolios to take advantage of opportunities for portfolio purchases as they arise_**
**_in the market._**

As the length of time involved in collecting on our existing portfolios may be extensive, and the factors
affecting debt collection rates may be volatile and outside our control, we may be unable to identify or
cope with adverse economic trends, prevent the negative effects of changes in legislation (including
tax) as previously stated or make changes in our purchasing strategies in a timely manner. If the
assumptions we use in our models are incorrect, including, but not limited to, that claims are not time
barred, that the age and balances of purchased claims are correctly stated by the sellers, that


-----

customers are alive and that the claim is not a result of fraud, money laundering or financing of terrorist
activities or if some of the accounts in a portfolio behave differently from the way we expect, it could
result in the relevant portfolio losing value, subsequent negative revaluations in our statement of
financial position and a continuing deterioration in value over time as actual collections can deviate
significantly from the collection estimates produced by our pricing model as accounts age.

We purchase loans at significant discount to total collectible value on purchased debt. These are
typically loans that customers have failed to repay and, in many cases, that the client has deemed to
be uncollectable. It is crucial for our business that we are able to identify portfolios that are of sufficient
quality for us to determine that we are likely to collect on the claims. Clients generally make numerous
attempts to recover on their overdue loans and other overdue receivables before selling them, often
using a combination of in-house recovery efforts and third-party collection agencies. These overdue
claims are difficult to collect and we may not collect a sufficient amount to cover our investment
associated with purchasing the portfolios of overdue receivables and the costs of running our
business. There can be no assurances that any of the claims contained in our purchased portfolios will
eventually be collected. Most of the claims that we own are unsecured and an increase in bankruptcy
filings involving customers could impact our ability to collect on those claims. Further, limitations
imposed on us by debt originators of debt portfolios may adversely impact our operational flexibility.
Contracts entered into with our clients for the purchase of debt portfolios may impose various
restrictions on our realization of value from the debt portfolios and may restrict our flexibility in pursuing
certain enforcement and collection activities. If the cash flows from our existing portfolios (and the debt
portfolios we purchase in the future) are less than anticipated, we may be unable to purchase all of the
new portfolios that we would like to purchase, we may have to pay a higher interest rate to finance the
purchase of new portfolios or we may have to accept lower returns. As a result, this could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_The statistical models and data analysis tools that we use in our business may prove to be_**
**_inaccurate, we may not achieve anticipated levels of return and we may be unable to_**
**_appropriately identify and address underperforming portfolios._**

We use internally-developed models and other data analysis tools extensively in our operations. For
example, we use our experience-driven models to estimate collection curves in relation to potential
portfolio purchases. At the time of purchase, however, we are likely to have imperfect information about
the precise age of the debt, the ability of the customer to pay, the time at which the customer will pay
and the cost required to service and collect on such debts. Moreover, our historical information about
portfolios may not be indicative of the characteristics of subsequent portfolios purchased from the
same client or within the same industry due to changes in business practices or economic
developments. Further, the availability of relevant data varies from market to market. In addition, certain
assets, such as secured loans, have different risk and collection profiles than the unsecured loans and
receivables that have historically been our main focus. There is a significant amount of management
judgment and estimation involved in purchasing and valuing portfolios and there can be no
assurances that management’s judgments and estimations will prove to be accurate. Furthermore,
there can be no assurances that we will be able to appropriately identify and address underperforming
portfolios.

In addition, if we purchase types of portfolios with which we have limited experience, or purchase
portfolios in regions in which we have limited experience, or from clients with whom we have no prior
dealings, our ability to properly price and to collect on such portfolios may be adversely affected. Lack
of reliable information, or the use of incorrect assumptions, can lead to mispricing of purchased
portfolios, which may have an adverse effect on the financial returns from such portfolios. Our
statistical models and analysis tools assess information provided by third parties, such as credit
information suppliers and other mainstream or public sources, or generated by software products. We
have no control over the accuracy or sufficiency of information received from such third parties. If such
information is not accurate or sufficient, we could incorrectly price portfolios that we purchase, or
incorrectly value our existing portfolios, set client prices or performance goals inaccurately, and
experience lower liquidation rates or larger operating expenses.


-----

Similarly, due to the nature of our business, we are not able to independently verify the quality of all
the debt claims we purchase, in particular in forward flow debt purchase agreements, and we rely on
representations made by our debt purchase clients. The inaccuracy of any of such representations,
including in relation to the validity of the debt claims, may result in a loss of revenue and we may not
always be successful in recovering such losses from our customers.

There can be no assurances that any of the current or future loans contained in our purchased debt
will eventually be collected. If we are not able to achieve forecasted levels of collection, valuation
impairments may be recognized, amortization may increase and revenue and returns on purchases of
portfolios may be reduced. This may impact our modeling for future collections, which is less reliable
if the quantity and identity of customers who reduce their debt payments, or the amounts of such
reductions, cannot be accurately predicted. Furthermore, some of our contracts contain guaranteed
solution rate commitments, pursuant to which we guarantee a minimum level of collections to our
clients. If we fail to reach these collection requirements, as has occurred in the past, we may have to
make significant payments to such clients, or such clients could reduce the amount of overdue loans
and receivables that we are entitled to collect under these contracts. Any of the foregoing factors could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We may not be able to purchase portfolios at appropriate prices or of sufficient quality._**

Portfolios do not become available for purchase on a consistent basis through the year. The availability
of portfolios at prices that generate an appropriate return depends on a number of factors both within
and outside of our control, such as the continuation of current growth trends in the levels of overdue
loans and other overdue receivables, volumes of portfolio sales by clients and competitive factors
affecting potential purchasers and debt originators. Additionally, an increase in demand for portfolios
among competitors could result in us not being chosen to purchase a portfolio due to more attractive
offers from competitors.

There can be no assurances that we will continuously be able to identify a sufficient volume of
portfolios at appropriate prices. If we are unable to identify portfolios at appropriate prices or that are
of sufficient quality, we may have to purchase loans of asset types or in industries in which we have
little or no experience, or in industries where it is more difficult to collect on overdue receivables
because of secrecy requirements, for example the healthcare or legal sector. Purchases in these asset
types or industries may impair our ability to collect on these claims and may cause us to pay too much
for these claims and consequently we may not generate a profit from these debt purchases. A potential
inconsistency in the availability of portfolios for purchase may mean that during certain financial
reporting periods we may make few or no purchases of debt.

If we are unable to identify sufficient levels of attractive portfolios and generate an appropriate return
on purchased debt, we may experience difficulties covering such expenses and may, as a
consequence, have to reduce the number of our collection personnel or take other measures to reduce
costs. These developments could lead to disruptions in our operations, loss of efficiency, low
employee morale, fewer experienced employees and excess costs. Any of these developments could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Failure to renew existing debt collection contracts or win new debt collection contracts may_**
**_adversely affect our revenue._**

We obtain many of our debt collection contracts through a competitive bidding process, and
substantially all of the debt collection contracts that we expect to seek in the foreseeable future likely
will be subject to a competitive bidding process. We may be required to compete to renew existing
debt collection contracts that have in the past been awarded to us without competition from
competitors or as to which we have been the incumbent provider of debt collection services for a long
time. We may also be required to enter into debt collection contracts at price levels or with margins
that are lower than we find acceptable. We may not be afforded the opportunity in the future to bid on
debt collection contracts that are held by other companies and are scheduled to expire if the existing
contract is extended. In addition, we cannot be certain that all our existing customers will choose to


-----

continue to use our debt collection services in the future. Our inability to renew contracts with existing
customers or to find suitable replacements could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_Failure to replace terminated forward flow agreements or successfully manage our commitments_**
**_under forward flow agreements may adversely affect our revenue._**

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2017, SEK 1,055 million of the aggregate debt purchased by
the Company on a pro forma combined basis involved forward flow agreements. In the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, SEK 497 million, SEK 687 million and SEK 620 million,
respectively, of the aggregate debt purchased by Intrum Justitia and €57 million, €63 million and
€66 million, respectively, of the aggregate debt purchased by Lindorff involved forward flow
agreements. A forward flow agreement is an arrangement in which we agree to purchase claims based
on specific parameters from a third-party supplier on a periodic basis at a set price over a specified
time period. We could lose a potential source of income if we are unable to renew or replace any
volume represented by our forward flow agreements upon termination or expiration. Forward flow
agreements are typically not long-term contracts in nature and typically do not provide medium- to
long-term assurance on purchasing levels.

Commitments under forward flow contracts are typically not more than 12 months, however depending
upon the length of the contractual arrangements, forward flow agreements typically contain
termination clauses that allow the arrangement to be terminated in certain circumstances. We may be
required to purchase debt under a forward flow agreement for an amount higher than we would
otherwise have agreed at the time of purchase, which could result in reduced returns. In a more
competitive environment, we could be faced with a decision to either decrease our purchasing volume
or agree to forward flow agreements at increased prices or with less contractual protections, any of
which could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations. We generally contemplate
future fluctuations in the value of the debt that we purchase through forward flow agreements, but such
fluctuations in value may exceed our expectations. If we are unable to contractually terminate an
agreement we may have to accept claims that are of a lower quality than what we intended to
purchase, which could result in lower returns. If the quality of debt purchased varies from our pricing
assumptions, we may also price the contract improperly. Any of these developments could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We may not be able to procure sufficient funding at favorable terms to purchase further portfolios_**
**_as they become available._**

Historically, we have funded purchases of portfolios through borrowings, capital injections by our
shareholders and cash generated by our operations. Our ability to obtain funding in the future from
these sources will therefore depend on our performance and prospects, as well as factors over which
we do not exercise control. Such factors may include weak economic and capital market conditions
during or prior to periods in which attractive portfolios are available for purchase, the ability and
willingness of banks to lend to our industry generally or to us in particular, and changes in fiscal,
monetary and other government policies, among others. There can be no assurances that the terms
of our existing or future indebtedness will not limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness to fund
such portfolio purchases. An inability to procure sufficient funding at favorable terms to purchase
portfolios as they become available could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations or financial condition.

**_A material failure in banking systems could negatively affect our business._**

We depend on banking systems to execute payment transactions in connection with our business.
A systematic shutdown of the banking industry would impede our ability to process funds on behalf of
clients and to collect on claims. As such, any material failure in banking systems could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.


-----

**_We depend on certain third parties as part of the supply chain to provide our services._**

Our business is dependent on a number of key relationships with third parties as part of the supply
chain to provide our services. We outsource certain IT functions, and the success of this depends on
our ability to organize the outsourcing effectively and to share certain data with such third parties. We
also rely on third-party partners to collect on claims located outside of the geographic markets in which
we have local operations. The third parties that we engage to carry out such international debt
collection services are subject to more limited supervision by the Company than our own local
operations, which may make us subject to additional risks in relation to these services, such as
potential non-compliance and business integrity issues which could significantly harm our reputation.
We also contract field collectors to carry out debt collection on our behalf and some of our entities also
outsource their amicable collection services to call centers, some of which are located in countries in
which we do not otherwise have operations. Additionally, we typically utilize bailiffs to assist with
seizure of property, garnishments and other court ordered solutions and to enforce certain successfully
resolved legal claims. There can be no assurances that we will successfully eliminate the risk that a
third party or bailiff may act outside of the applicable frameworks or our own policies and procedures.
Our reputation and relationships with our clients could be adversely affected if these bailiffs do not act
in accordance with applicable legal frameworks.

If any of these third-party providers do not meet the agreed service levels, or if there were to be any
breach in the data protection of any of these third-party providers who may have access to the
confidential information of our clients, this could adversely affect our reputation and our relationships
with our clients. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations or financial condition or potentially lead to administrative fines or sanctions.

**_As we increase our focus on certain business areas and move into new business areas, our_**
**_operations will become increasingly complex._**

We have recently increased our focus our focus on certain business areas, such as SME loans,
secured loans and RES (which involves the servicing, maintenance and sale of real estate owned by
our clients) on behalf of third-party clients. We may also expand these operations into other
jurisdictions. This will likely result in our operations becoming increasingly complex and we must
maintain and increase our competence within these areas in order to remain competitive and
profitable. For example, SME loans have different pricing and collection profiles, RES on behalf of thirdparty clients is connected with and exposed to real estate prices and secured loans have different risk
and collection profiles than the unsecured loans and receivables that have historically been our main
focus. Secured loans and RES on behalf of third-party clients require different competence and data
capabilities in order to price, service and manage such portfolios efficiently. Our ability to properly price
and collect on SME, secured and real estate loans and receivables may be adversely affected by our
limited experience in these areas, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations or financial condition.

**_Acquisitions or carve-out transactions that we have entered or may in the future enter into may_**
**_prove unsuccessful or strain or divert our resources and we may not be able to manage our_**
**_growth effectively._**

During the periods under review, Intrum Justitia and Lindorff have made a number of substantial
business acquisitions, including the 1st Credit Acquisition and the Aktua Acquisition, respectively, and
carve-out transactions. The success of such acquisitions and carve-out transactions is dependent
upon, _inter alia, appropriate due diligence having been conducted, such transactions having been_
negotiated on favorable terms and successful integration of the acquired businesses. It may take
longer than anticipated to realize anticipated benefits from such acquisitions and carve-out
transactions and there can be no assurances that we will be able to extract any anticipated synergies,
or that such potential benefits will outweigh the associated costs. Further, such acquisitions and carveout transactions may place additional constraints on our resources, including diverting the attention of
our management from existing business operations to such integration processes. For a description of
the risks associated with the Merger, see “—Risks Related to the Transactions.”


-----

Both Intrum Justitia and Lindorff have historically expanded through both external and organic growth,
and we plan to continue to grow by selectively identifying potential acquisitions of portfolios and
businesses, as well as carve-out opportunities with respect to collection units. If we do acquire other
businesses or complete other carve-out transactions, we may not be able to successfully integrate
these businesses and assets with our own and we may be unable to maintain our standards, controls
and policies which may result in compliance issues, goodwill write-offs and damage to our reputation.
For example, when integrating new businesses and collection units, we face costs and security risks
due to the need to integrate the IT platform of the purchased company or carved-out operations into
our existing IT platform. Additionally, if we purchase a large portfolio we may be unable to successfully
integrate it into our existing operations, the successful integration of the portfolio may take longer than
anticipated or the costs associated with successfully integrating it may be higher than anticipated.
Further, we are subject to the risks associated with write-downs and impairments of goodwill in
connection with acquisitions.

Our growth strategy includes opportunistically entering into new geographies or new business areas
through selective acquisitions and carve-outs that we believe will complement and enhance our
pan-European service offering. For instance, in June 2016 Lindorff acquired Aktua and in October 2016
Intrum Justitia acquired a portfolio of receivables for €58 million from Erste Bank Hungary. These
acquisitions represented each company’s first major entry into the secured loans market. In February
2017, Intrum Justitia completed its acquisition of 1st Credit, an acquisition which marked Intrum
Justitia’s re-establishment of operations in the UK market. Integrating recently acquired business and
achieving the expected operational synergies will require the dedication of management resources that
may temporarily divert attention from our day-to-day operations, and we may face unforeseen
challenges in operating within unfamiliar commercial, cultural and regulatory environments. For
example, following the acquisition of the portfolio of receivables from Erste Bank Hungary,
amendments to local legislation affected the process through which collections on assets may be
achieved and Intrum Justitia was required to adapt its expectations to account for this change
accordingly. The failure to successfully integrate recently acquired business, or to manage our entry
into new geographies or business areas generally could have an adverse impact on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

There can be no assurances that we will be able to manage our growth effectively and that our
infrastructure, facilities and personnel will be adequate to support our future operations or to effectively
adapt to future growth. Any of these developments could lead to operational risks or have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We may not be able to successfully maintain, manage and develop our IT infrastructure platform_**
**_or data analysis systems, anticipate, manage or adopt technological advances within our industry_**
**_or prevent a breach or disruption of the security of our IT infrastructure platform and data_**
**_analysis systems._**

We rely on our IT infrastructure platform and data analysis systems and our ability to integrate and
centralize the IT systems of Intrum Justitia and Lindorff will significantly bear on our success. The
importance of our IT infrastructure and data analytics to our business subjects us to inherent costs and
risks associated with integrating, maintaining, upgrading, replacing and changing these systems,
including impairment of our information technology, substantial capital expenditures and demands on
management time. For example, the purchase of existing collection operations through the acquisition
of a company or a carve-out transaction in order to expand into a new country may force us to upgrade
the IT platform and data analysis systems of the newly acquired operations to meet our standards,
causing increased capital expenditures and demands on management time.

IT and telecommunications technologies are evolving rapidly and are characterized by short product
life cycles. We may not be successful in anticipating, managing or adopting technological changes on
a timely basis. We may not be successful in implementing improvements of our IT or data analysis
systems, including reducing the number of our collection systems and improving operation efficiency
through further IT development, which could result in additional costs. The cost of these improvements


-----

could be higher than anticipated or result in management not being able to devote sufficient attention
to other areas of our business. We depend on having the capital resources necessary to invest in new
technologies to purchase and service claims and there can be no assurances that adequate capital
resources will be available to us at the appropriate time. Furthermore, if we become unable to continue
to acquire, aggregate or use such information and data in the manner or to the extent in which it is
currently acquired, aggregated and used, due to lack of resources, regulatory restrictions or any other
reason, we may lose a significant competitive advantage.

Any security breach in our IT infrastructure platform and data analysis systems, or any temporary or
permanent failure in these systems, could cause significant disruptions to our operations. We may
need to further enhance capabilities and resilience and we may be subject to future attempts to gain
unauthorized access to confidential or sensitive information. Our websites could potentially suffer
cyber-attacks, which could disrupt our IT infrastructure platform, payment services platform and data
analysis systems and impair our ability to provide online services. In addition, in the event of a
catastrophic occurrence, our ability to protect our infrastructure and maintain ongoing operations
could be significantly impaired. Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be
successful in mitigating the effects of a catastrophic occurrence, such as fire, flood, tornado, power
loss or telecommunications failures for some or all of our IT infrastructure platform and data analysis
systems. Any of these developments or, in addition, any failure by the Company to remedy material
weaknesses identified in our IT systems could hinder or prevent us from using our IT infrastructure
platform or data analysis systems as part of our business and could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We rely on publicly available data provided by third-party sources and an increase in the cost of,_**
**_or a failure to receive, the available data could negatively affect our business._**

We rely partly on publicly available data provided by multiple credit information suppliers and other
sources in order to operate our business. Our business, along with the businesses of our competitors,
could be negatively affected if any third-party sources were to stop providing this data for any reason,
including a change in laws or regulations, or if they were to considerably raise the price of their
services. Any of these developments could hinder or prevent us from using our data analysis as part
of our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or
financial condition.

**_Improper disclosure of our clients’ sensitive data, customer data or a breach of data protection_**
**_laws could negatively affect our business or reputation._**

We collect, handle, process and retain large amounts of potentially sensitive or confidential information
such as personal information of customers, including names and account numbers, locations, contact
information and other account specific data. Any security or privacy breaches of these databases
could expose us to liability, increase our expenses relating to resolution of these breaches, harm our
reputation and deter clients from conducting business with us. We rely on our data analysis system to
record and process data quickly and accurately to access, maintain and expand the databases we use
for our debt collection and for our analysis of potential debt purchases. Our ability to conduct our
business, such as the ability to price the purchase of portfolios, trace customers and develop tailored
repayment plans, depends on our ability to use customer data in our data analysis system. Our ability
to obtain, retain, share and otherwise process customer data is governed by data protection laws,
privacy requirements and other regulatory restrictions, including, for example, that personal data may
only be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes, and may only be processed in a
manner consistent with these purposes. Further, the collected personal data must be adequate,
relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which it is collected and/or processed, and
it must not be kept in a form that permits identification of customers for a longer period of time than
necessary for the purposes of the collection. It is possible that our security controls over personal
customer data, our training of employees and partners on data protection, and other data protection
practices we follow may not prevent the improper collection, retention, disclosure or processing of
such sensitive information in breach of contract and applicable law, which may vary across the


-----

jurisdictions in which we operate. Any material failure to collect, retain, use or process customer data
in compliance with applicable laws could result in the revocation of our licenses in the jurisdictions in
which we operate, our licenses being made subject to more onerous or disadvantageous terms,
monetary fines, criminal charges and breach of contractual arrangements.

The data protection laws in each of the countries in which we operate are extensive and our data
collection systems may not be in compliance with such laws from time to time or we may not change,
or be able to change, our data analysis systems to adapt to any changes in law in a timely manner. A
significant violation of data protection laws could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations or financial condition.

**_Failure to protect our customer data from unauthorized use could negatively affect our business._**

Failure to protect, monitor and control the use of our customer data could cause us to lose a
competitive advantage. We rely on a combination of contractual provisions and confidentiality
procedures to protect our customer data and our customer data is stored and protected in our IT
infrastructure platform with access limitations. These measures afford only limited protection and
competitors or others may gain access to our customer data. Our customer data could be subject to
unauthorized use, misappropriation, or disclosure, despite having required our employees,
consultants, debt collection partners, and clients to enter into confidentiality agreements. There can be
no assurances that such confidentiality agreements will not be breached or will be of sufficient duration
and that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure. Policing
unauthorized use of such rights can be difficult and expensive and adequate remedies may not be
available or available in an acceptable time frame. A failure to protect our customer data from
unauthorized use, or to comply with current applicable or future laws or regulations, could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Our senior management team is important to our continued success. Demand in our industry for_**
**_personnel with the relevant capabilities and experience is high and the loss of one or more_**
**_members of senior management could negatively affect our business._**

Our future success partially depends on the skills, experience and efforts of our senior management
and other key personnel and our ability to retain such members of the management team and other
key employees. The demand in our industry for personnel with the relevant capabilities and experience
is high and our success in attracting and retaining employees is not guaranteed. There can be no
assurances that we will be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional
qualified management in the future. The loss of the services of our senior management and other key
personnel could seriously impair our ability to continue to purchase portfolios or collect on claims and
to manage and expand our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations or financial condition.

**_We may not be able to hire and retain enough sufficiently trained personnel to support our_**
**_operations._**

The debt collection industry is labor intensive and we compete for qualified personnel with companies
in our industry and in other industries. There can be no assurances that we will be able to continue to
hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel or be flexible enough to react to
changing market environments. Our growth requires that we continually hire and train new debt
collectors. A higher turnover rate among our debt collectors will increase our recruiting and training
costs and limit the number of experienced debt collection personnel available to service our and our
clients’ portfolios. If this were to occur, we would not be able to service such portfolios effectively and
this would reduce our ability to continue our growth and to operate profitability. We also have a number
of employees that possess critical knowledge about our IT infrastructure platform, data analysis
systems and our debt purchasing operations and an inability to retain these employees could
negatively impact our business. For example, if we were to lose the head of debt purchasing in any of
the countries where we operate, we would need to shift resources from the Company-level to the
specific country and could experience a reduction in purchasing levels until we find a suitable locally

based replacement. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations or financial condition.

**_Increases in labor costs, potential labor disputes and work stoppages could negatively affect our_**
**_business._**

Our financial performance is affected by the availability of qualified personnel and the cost of labor. For
the twelve months ended March 31, 2017, Intrum Justitia and Lindorff had an average of 4,081 and
4,182 full-time employees (including temporary employees), respectively. There are currently collective
bargaining agreements in place with certain unions. If we are unable to maintain satisfactory labor
agreements with our unionized employees and works councils, we could experience a disruption of
our operations, which could impede our ability to provide services to our clients. In addition, an
increased number of unionized employees could cause us to incur additional labor costs and increase
the related risks we face. Potential labor disputes could disrupt our operations. Further, an increased
demand for our employees from competitors could increase costs associated with employee
compensation. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations or financial condition.

**_Litigation, investigations and proceedings may negatively affect our business._**

We may be adversely affected by judgments, settlements, unanticipated costs or other effects of legal
and administrative proceedings now pending or that may be instituted in the future, or from
investigations by regulatory bodies or administrative agencies. Intrum Justitia is currently subject to
two tax audits and Lindorff is currently party to a number of ongoing tax litigations, audits and
investigations regarding VAT, corporate income taxes, intra-group loan pricing, interest cost
deductions and other matters in a number of jurisdictions in which it operates. As described in more
detail elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, in May 2017, Lindorff’s appeal to the Supreme
Administrative Court of Helsinki in relation to deduction of interest on a group internal loan to its Finnish
branch was rejected. The exposure related to this case is €35 million. The total estimated tax effect if
Lindorff loses all other tax-related cases is €21 million, including punitive tax increases. In respect of
the legal proceedings in Helsinki as well as those pending against Lindorff, €56 million has been paid
and/or provided for in Lindorff’s accounts or is indemnified by the previous owners of Lindorff.
Depending on the outcome of such tax litigations, audits and investigations, tax authorities may launch
tax audits or investigations relating to subsequent periods. We may become subject to claims and a
number of judicial and administrative proceedings considered normal in the course of our operations,
including consumer credit disputes with customers, labor disputes, contract disputes, intellectual
property disputes, government audits and proceedings, client disputes and tort claims. In some
proceedings, the claimant may seek damages as well as other remedies, which, if granted, would
require expenditures on our part and we may ultimately incur costs relating to these proceedings that
exceed our present or future financial accruals or insurance coverage. Even if we or our directors,
officers and employees (as the case may be) are not ultimately found to be liable, defending claims or
lawsuits could be expensive and time consuming, divert management resources, damage our
reputation and attract regulatory inquiries. Any of these developments could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. For further details regarding material
legal and administrative proceedings to which Intrum Justitia and Lindorff are currently party, see
“Business—Intrum Justitia: Legal and Administrative Proceedings” and “Business—Lindorff: Legal and
_Administrative Proceedings.”_

**_Our effective tax rate may increase._**

As a multinational company, we are subject to taxation in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective
tax rate is subject to fluctuation from one period to the next because the income tax rates for each year
are a function of many factors, including: (i) taxable income levels and the effects of a mix of profits
(losses) earned by the Company in numerous tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates;
(ii) our ability to utilize deferred tax assets; (iii) taxes, refunds, interest or penalties resulting from tax
audits; (iv) the magnitude of various credits and deductions as a percentage of total taxable income;
and (v) changes in tax laws, the interpretation of such tax laws or changes to national corporate income


-----

tax rates. Changes in the mix of these items may cause our effective tax rate to fluctuate between
periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial
condition.

Tax structuring within international groups has become increasingly a corporate social responsibility
issue and there is currently strong political pressure to change the international tax environment. In
light of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan, launched by the OECD and supported
by the EU, and its rapid development, there are indications that there is support for global tax
coordination among jurisdictions which could have a significant impact on the international taxation
landscape in which we operate.

**_Recent and future changes in Swedish tax legislation can limit or prevent us from making tax_**
**_deductions for interest._**

Sweden has, like several other countries where we operate, tax limitation deductions rules for interest
on intragroup loans. In June 2014 the corporate tax committee (Sw. _Företagsskattekommittén) (the_
“Committee”), appointed by the former Swedish government, presented a proposal to introduce a
new system for corporate taxation in Sweden. The purpose was to create a more neutral taxation of
own and borrowed capital. The Committee presented two alternative options both of which contained
limited deductibility of interests in general. In one of the proposals the current rules about limitations
in the deductibility for interest on intragroup loans would remain. The proposals were severely
criticized by the referral bodies (Sw. remissinstanserna) and the government have announced that the
proposal should be revised and that a new remittance of the final proposal will be necessary. It is
therefore not possible to, at present, predict when and if the final proposal will enter into force, and how
it will be worded. Sweden is expected to implement the European Union Anti-Tax-Avoidance Directive
which is part of the European Union Anti-Tax Avoidance Package. This directive contains several
legally-binding anti-abuse measures including rules on limited deductibility for net interest expense
based on EBIT/EBITDA. Such directive should, in this part, be implemented at the latest on
December 31, 2018. If new, more restrictive, interest deduction limitation rules are introduced in
Sweden (or in any other country where we operate), it could have a negative effect on our financial
position and result.

**_Recent changes in Norwegian tax law may limit or prevent us from applying tax deductions_**
**_arising from certain intra group loans and we may be impacted by other future changes in_**
**_Norwegian tax law, regulations and its application, possibly with retroactive effect._**

Norwegian tax law imposes rules concerning limitations on interest deductions arising from
intercompany loans and certain external loans which could imply limitations on the rights to deduct
interest for our Norwegian subsidiaries.

Under the rules, interest deductions on intercompany loans are limited to 25% of a specifically defined
profit (“taxable EBITDA”). The right to deduct interest is, however, not limited if a company’s total net
interest costs are NOK 5 million or lower. The limitation and threshold amount is calculated separately
for each company in the group.

Under the interest limitation rules, the intercompany lender (if taxable in Norway) will be taxed for its
interest income even though the borrower’s right to deduct interest costs will be limited under the rule.

The interest limitation rules also contain provisions under which external loans will be regarded as
internal loans in a number of contexts. If, for instance, a parent company has provided a guarantee for
the debt, the borrowing company’s external loan is to be reclassified as an internal loan subject to the
rules concerning limitations on interest deductions.

The Ministry of Finance has recently in a consultation paper proposed that the interest deduction
limitation rules should be extended to include interest paid to an independent (external) lender by a
borrower that is part of a group. It proposes that this extended scope (regarding interest paid to
external lender for group companies) will apply only if net interest costs exceeds NOK 10 million.
Further, an exception is proposed that implies that the borrower nevertheless maintains a right to


-----

deduction for interest expenses if the equity ratio of the Norwegian entity, or alternatively the average
of all Norwegian entities in the group, is equal to or higher than the equity ratio of the group globally.
The extended scope of the interest limitation rule is expected to enter into force from 2018.

There may be also be changes in Norwegian tax law imposing withholding tax on interest. The Ministry
of Finance has stated that a consultation paper relating to the introduction of withholding tax on interest
payments will be submitted for consultation during summer 2017. Such internal legal rule is expected
to enter info force at the earliest from the fiscal year 2018. Many tax treaties limit Norway’s ability to
impose withholding tax on interest. A withholding tax will however, if implemented, take full effect in
relation to states which Norway does not have a tax treaty.

**_Our tax expenses may increase due to ongoing and future tax audits and certain potential_**
**_changes in current taxation rules._**

We operate in 23 countries. The business, including the implementation of transactions between
entities within the Company, is conducted in accordance with our interpretation and understanding of
current tax legislation, tax treaties and other provisions, case law and claims from tax authorities.
However, there is a risk that our interpretation and application of mentioned tax rules, treaties, and
other regulations and requirements have not been, or will not continue to be, completely accurate in
all respects. There is also a risk that the tax authorities in the countries concerned will issue decisions
that deviate from our interpretation. Changes in tax law or practice could result in financial losses or
increased expenses for the Company.

In relation to corporate income tax, the Company, as a multinational group with several types of
transactions occurring between legal entities in different jurisdictions, must comply with the OECD
requirements regarding transfer pricing and transfer pricing documentation, as well as with new
legislation being implemented as a result of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) framework.
BEPS refers to tax avoidance strategies that exploit gaps and mismatches in tax rules to artificially shift
profits to low or no-tax locations. The new rules may, in practice and under certain circumstances,
result in double taxation of income or in costs being non-deductible.

In relation to value-added tax (“VAT”), the application of, exemption from, or refund of VAT varies
according to both the jurisdiction in which the service is being provided and the nature of the service
itself. Financial services, including the purchased debt component of the Company’s Financial
Services service line, are treated in many jurisdictions as tax-exempt or out of scope for VAT purposes.
This may result in different interpretations regarding the possibility to recover input VAT charged to the
Company by external and internal suppliers. The treatment of VAT claims included in receivables
purchased from external parties also varies between the jurisdictions. For example, in the Netherlands,
a VAT receivable is incurred when purchasing overdue receivables. The VAT portion of the receivable
can be recovered from the tax authorities if it is not collected from the debtor. In Sweden, the Supreme
Court issued a judgment in December 2016 regarding a claim against a private individual that had
been acquired by a financial company. The claim had originally arisen through the sale of goods to a
company that was subsequently declared bankrupt, and where the private individual liable for the
claim had been a member of the board of directors. The Supreme Court held that the private individual
was not liable for the portion of the claim relating to VAT, since the company that originally sold the
goods had recovered the VAT from the Swedish Tax Agency. We are currently assessing the judgment
to consider whether this could have any impact on our purchased debt operations. Changes in fiscal
regulations or the interpretation of tax laws, and any consequent VAT payments, may have a material
adverse effect on our business.

**_Spanish tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for Spanish tax purposes, of all or a portion_**
**_of the interest on our indebtedness, thus it may reduce the cash flow available to service our_**
**_indebtedness._**

Spanish Corporate Income Tax Law also contains a general limitation on the deductibility of certain net
financial expenses incurred by a Spanish Corporate Income taxpayer (or by a Corporate Income Tax
consolidated group to which such entity belongs) exceeding 30% of its annual operating profit (defined


-----

as EBITDA subject to certain adjustments), with €1 million being deductible in any case. Deductible
interest after the application of the aforementioned limitations will be referred hereto as the “Maximum
Deductible Amount.” The apportionment of non-deducted interest in a given fiscal year, may be
deducted in the following fiscal years, subject to the Maximum Deductible Amount in each subsequent
fiscal year. If the amount of net financial expenses in a given fiscal year is below the Maximum
Deductible Amount, the difference between the net financial expenses deducted in that year and the
Maximum Deductible Amount may increase such Maximum Deductible Amount in the immediate
subsequent five years.

The impact of the above rules on our ability to deduct interest paid on indebtedness could increase
our tax burden and therefore negatively impact our cash-flows, financial condition and operating
results and, potentially, our ability to serve our indebtedness.

**_We may experience volatility in our reported financial results due to the revaluation of our_**
**_purchased portfolios and the timing of portfolio purchases during the financial year._**

Our purchased portfolios are recorded at purchase cost at the time of their purchase and thereafter
held at amortized cost through profit and loss. The performance of our portfolios is tested regularly.
Any revaluation is charged through the profit and loss account as an adjustment to revenues.
Accordingly, the value of our purchased portfolios as recorded on our statement of financial position
and our revenues in our income statement may fluctuate each time management reassesses
forecasted cash flows.

Our forecasted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions, as their forecast is generated by
applying historically observed decay rates to the actual gross collections achieved in recent months
and accounting for macroeconomic conditions and operational improvements, among other things.
These historically observed decay rates are linked to the underlying collection fundamentals applicable
at the time, including, among others, general economic conditions, the collections strategy, collections
legislation and customer behavior. Any changes to these assumptions could result in revaluations,
which would have the effect of changing the value of the portfolios on our consolidated statement of
financial position and lead to the inclusion of a revaluation in our consolidated profit and loss account.
While revaluations are non-cash movements, they are derived from the actual collections achieved in
each individual portfolio, and they affect revenue and, therefore, cost of sales as a percentage of
revenue. This subsequently impacts other profit and loss account line items, including gross profit,
operating profit and the amount of tax on ordinary activities, and can also impact our cash outflows for
tax payments.

There is generally a gap between the point in time when we purchase a portfolio and the point in time
when we begin earning returns on the purchased portfolio as we do not always have control over when
a deal to purchase a portfolio will close and we need to locate customers, build a consolidated profile
of each such customer’s circumstances and formulate an appropriate repayment solution before we
can start to collect on a purchased portfolio. As a result, we may experience uneven cash flows and
delays in generating income from purchased portfolios. Any of the foregoing factors could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Our collections may decrease and/or the timing on when we collect may be delayed if the_**
**_number of consumers becoming subject to personal insolvency procedures increases._**

We recover on claims that may become subject to insolvency procedures under applicable laws and
we also purchase portfolios containing claims that are currently subject to insolvency proceedings.
Various economic trends and potential changes to existing legislation may contribute to an increase in
the number of consumers subject to personal insolvency procedures. Under some insolvency
procedures, a person’s assets may be sold to repay creditors. While we have recently increased our
focus on secured NPLs so may be in a position to collect on such portfolios under insolvency
procedures, the majority of portfolios that we service are unsecured and so we are generally unable to
collect on such portfolios under insolvency procedures involving the sale of a person’s assets.
Therefore, our ability to successfully collect on portfolios may decline or the timing on when we collect


-----

on portfolios may be delayed with an increase in personal insolvency procedures, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We may be unable to obtain account documents for some of the accounts that we purchase._**

When we commence enforcement actions through legal proceedings, courts may require a copy of the
account statements or applications to be attached to the pleadings in order to obtain a judgment
against a particular customer. Where we are unable to produce account documents in response to a
customer’s request, that account would be legally unenforceable. Furthermore, if any of the account
documents we do have were found to be legally unenforceable, courts may deny our claims. Any
changes to laws, regulations or rules that affect the manner in which we initiate enforcement
proceedings, including rules affecting documentation, could result in increased administration costs or
limit the availability of litigation as a collection tool, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business and results of operations. Additionally, our ability to collect by means other than legal
proceedings may be impacted by laws that require that certain types of account documentation be in
our possession prior to the institution of any collection activities, which could also have a material
adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

**_Historical operating results and quarterly cash collections may not be indicative of future_**
**_performance._**

Our future operating results may not reflect past performance. Our results of operations and financial
condition are dependent on our ability to generate collections from overdue receivables, which in turn
is impacted by the ability of customers to pay. The ability of customers to refinance their existing debt
could result in the reduction in the volume of NPLs available for collection or purchase. Further,
increasing interest rates may impact the ability of customers to pay claims that we own as customers
may have other debts that would be impacted by rising interest rates, resulting in an adverse effect in
our ability to collect on our purchased debt portfolios.

In addition, we are exposed to quarterly variations in our operating results, which may be affected by
the timing of the closing of portfolio purchases, which we often cannot control, and the speed with
which we can integrate the portfolios into our systems. We have historically experienced seasonal
variation in our collections, as discussed elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Consequently, our
revenue and margins may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. If the pace of our growth slows, our
quarterly cash collections and operating results may become increasingly subject to fluctuation. Any
of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or
financial condition.

**_We are exposed to the risk of currency fluctuations._**

Following the Merger, we will have local operations in 23 countries.

The results of operations and the financial position of Intrum Justitia’s subsidiaries are reported in the
relevant local currencies and then translated into Swedish kronor at the applicable exchange rates for
inclusion in Intrum Justitia’s consolidated financial statements, which are stated in Swedish kronor. For
the year ended December 31, 2016, 85% of Intrum Justitia’s revenue was reported by entities whose
functional currencies were different than Swedish kronor, primarily the euro and Swiss franc, which
accounted for 50% and 12%, respectively, of Intrum Justitia’s revenue in 2016.

The results and the financial position of Lindorff’s subsidiaries are reported in the relevant local
currencies, including Norwegian kroner and Swedish kronor, and then translated into euro at the
applicable exchange rates for inclusion in Lindorff’s consolidated financial statements, which are
stated in euro. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 38% of Lindorff’s revenue was reported by
entities whose functional currencies were different than the euro, primarily Norwegian kroner, Swedish
kronor and Danish kroner, which accounted for 23%, 9% and 3%, respectively, of Lindorff’s revenue in
2016.


-----

The exchange rates between some of these currencies and the Swedish kronor and the euro,
respectively, in recent years have fluctuated significantly and our local currencies may in the future
fluctuate significantly. Consequently, to the extent that foreign exchange rate exposures are not
hedged, fluctuations in currencies may adversely affect our financial results in ways unrelated to our
operations. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations or financial condition.

**_We may not be successful in achieving our strategic goals._**

We may not be successful in developing and implementing our strategic plans for our businesses,
including expanding into selected new geographic markets, leveraging our experience and capabilities
to enter new credit management verticals or new business areas and continuing to drive operational
scale and excellence across countries. If the development or implementation of such plans is not
successful we may not produce the revenue, margins, earnings or synergies that we need to be
successful and to offset the impact of adverse economic conditions that may exist currently or develop
in the future. We may also face delays or difficulties in implementing process and system
improvements, which could adversely affect our ability to successfully compete in the markets we
serve. In addition, the costs associated with implementing such plans may exceed anticipated
amounts and we may not have sufficient financial resources to fund all of the desired or necessary
investments required in connection with our plans, including one-time costs associated with our
business consolidation and operating improvement plans.

As part of our growth strategy, we seek acquisition opportunities and invest significant resources in
making acquisition bids, which we may not win. We may not recover allocated resources, costs and
expenses of failed bids, which could adversely impact our liquidity and cash flows. The existing and
future execution of our strategic and operating plans will, to some extent, also be dependent on
external factors that we cannot control, such as legislative changes, systemic failures in our industry
or the industry sectors of our clients and changes in fiscal and monetary policies. In addition, these
strategic and operational plans need to be continually reassessed to meet the challenges and needs
of our businesses in order for us to remain competitive. The failure to implement and execute our
strategic and operating plans in a timely manner or at all, realize the cost savings or other benefits or
improvements associated with such plans, have financial resources to fund the costs associated with
such plans or incur costs in excess of anticipated amounts, or sufficiently assess and reassess these
plans, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Our purchasing patterns and the seasonality of our business may lead to volatility in our cash_**
**_flow._**

Our business depends on the ability to collect on our debt portfolios and purchase portfolios of debt.
Debt collection is highly affected by seasonal factors, including the number of work days in a given
month, the propensity of customers to take holidays at particular times of the year and annual cycles
in disposable income. Accordingly, collections within portfolios tend to have high seasonal variances,
while our costs are more evenly spread out over the year, resulting in high variances of margins and
profitability between quarters. Furthermore, our debt portfolio purchases are likely to be uneven during
the year due to fluctuating supply and demand within the market. The combination of seasonal
collections and costs and uneven purchases may result in low cash flow at a time when attractive debt
portfolios become available. There can be no assurances that in the future we will be able to obtain
interim funding from our shareholders or by making other borrowings. A lack of cash flow could
prevent us from purchasing otherwise desirable debt portfolios or prevent us from meeting our
obligations under any forward flow agreements we may enter, either of which could materially and
adversely affect our business.

**_Our risk management procedures may fail to identify or anticipate future risks._**

We continually review our risk management policies and procedures and will continue to do so in the
future. Although we believe that our risk management procedures are adequate, many of our methods
of managing risk and exposures are based upon observed historical market behavior and


-----

statistic-based historical models. As a result, these methods may not accurately predict future
exposures, which could be significantly greater than historical measures indicate. Other risk
management methods depend on the evaluation of information regarding markets, debt originators,
debt collection agencies, customers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible
to us. We rely on intermediaries such as debt collection agencies, and we may be held liable for the
acts of intermediaries if we cannot demonstrate that we have adequate procedures in place to prevent
risks such as bribery. For example, debt originators typically require us to assume responsibility for the
acts of their respective third-party intermediaries in relation to ongoing compliance matters. Further, we
keep track of employee misconduct and have policies and procedures in place to minimize its impact,
but these procedures may not prove sufficient (for example, to avoid employee fraud). Failure (or the
perception that we have failed) to develop, implement, monitor and, when necessary, preemptively
upgrade our risk management policies and procedures could, at the very least, give rise to reputational
issues for both us and any associated debt originators, and may result in breaches of contractual
obligations by us, for which we may incur substantial losses and face removal from debt originators’
purchasing panels. Risks that we fail to anticipate, and/or adequately address, could have a material
adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.

**_A significant amount of our book value consists of intangible assets that may not generate cash_**
**_in the event of a voluntary or involuntary sale._**

Immediately after giving effect to the Transactions, the pro forma combined consolidated total assets
of the Company (based on allocations of the preliminary purchase price, which is subject to change
following the final valuation which will be completed following the Completion Date) is expected to be
SEK 64 billion, of which SEK 36 billion will be intangible. Intangible assets primarily include IT systems,
goodwill, customer relationships and trade names. While we believe that the carrying values of our
intangible assets are recoverable, you should not assume that we would receive any cash from the
voluntary or involuntary sale of these intangible assets, particularly if we were not continuing as an
operating business. Further, the Merger and any future acquisitions expose us to the risks associated
with write-downs and impairments to goodwill. We encourage you to read the Issuer’s Financial
Statements and Lindorff’s Financial Statements carefully as they provide more detailed information
about these intangible assets.

**Risks Related to Our Financial Profile**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and_**
**_prevent us from fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes. We may incur substantially_**
**_more debt in the future, including debt in connection with future acquisitions, which may make_**
**_it more difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate_**
**_our business._**

After the consummation of the Transactions, we have a significant amount of outstanding debt with
substantial debt service requirements. As of March 31, 2017, and as adjusted to give effect to the
Transactions, our total debt would have been SEK 35 billion. See “Capitalization.” In addition, the
Revolving Credit Facility provides for borrowings up to an aggregate of €1,100 million.

Our significant leverage could have important consequences for our business and operations and for
holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to:

- making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debts
and liabilities;

- increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse
economic and industry conditions;

- requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment
of principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow


-----

to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures or other general
corporate purposes;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive
environment and the industry in which we operate;

- placing us at a disadvantage to our competitors, to the extent that they are not as highly
leveraged;

- restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities;

- limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing; and

- making it difficult for us to comply with regulatory capital requirements.

In addition, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Although the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement and the Indenture each contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt,
these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and, under
certain circumstances, the amount of debt that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions
could be substantial. We will also be able to refinance debt outstanding under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement with debt incurred in compliance with these ratios and then be able to draw
amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement at a time when we do not meet these ratios.
The terms of the Indenture will permit us to incur future debt that may have substantially the same
covenants as, or covenants that are more restrictive than, those of the Indenture. Moreover, some of
the debt we may incur in the future could be structurally senior to the Notes or may be secured by
collateral that does not secure the Notes. In addition, the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute debt under those
agreements. The incurrence of additional debt would increase the leverage-related risks described in
this Offering Memorandum.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
satisfy our debt obligations including the Notes. Our ability to make payments on and refinance our
debt and to fund acquisitions, working capital expenditures and other expenses will depend on our
future operating performance and ability to generate cash from operations. Our ability to generate cash
from operations is subject, in large part, to general economic, competitive, legislative and regulatory
factors and other factors that are beyond our control. Therefore, we may not be able to generate
sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain enough capital to service our debt or to fund our future
acquisitions or other working capital expenditures. For a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity after
giving effect to the Transactions, see “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations of Intrum Justitia—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”_

**_Any inability to comply with the terms of our existing debt and to refinance any existing debt as_**
**_it comes due and payable or an increase in interest rate levels may have a negative effect on our_**
**_financial condition._**

As of March 31, 2017, as adjusted and after giving effect to the Transactions, and the application of the
proceeds from the offering of the Notes, our total debt would have been SEK 35 billion under our
various debt arrangements. These arrangements require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow to
service interest and to make principal repayments. Furthermore, we are subject to certain restrictive
covenants under our debt arrangements, which may limit our ability to engage in other transactions or
otherwise place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less debt. In addition,
non-compliance with the terms of our debt arrangements could have a negative effect on our business.
Further, certain of our debt arrangements are subject to floating interest rates and our finance cost will
accordingly be affected by an increase in interest rate levels. Any of these developments could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.


-----

**_We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future_**
**_operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities._**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement restrict, among
other things, our ability to:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

- pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock;

- make certain restricted payments (including dividends and distribution with respect to shares of
the Issuer) and investments;

- prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

- create or incur certain liens;

- impose restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or other payments to us;

- transfer, lease or sell assets;

- merge or consolidate with other entities;

- enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and

- amend certain documents.

All of these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants.” In addition, the Issuer’s other debt arrangements that will remain in place_
after the Transactions contain certain customary restrictions. See “Description of Other Indebtedness.”
The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance our future operations and
capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest.

In addition, we will be subject to the affirmative and negative covenants contained in the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement. In particular, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires us to maintain
a specified financial ratio under certain circumstances. Our ability to meet this financial ratio can be
affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet them. A breach of
any of those covenants, ratios or restrictions could result in an event of default under the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement. Upon the occurrence of any event of default under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement, subject to applicable cure periods and other limitations on acceleration or
enforcement, the relevant creditors could cancel the availability of the Revolving Credit Facility and
elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, together with accrued
interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, any default under the Revolving Credit Facility
could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain crossdefault or cross-acceleration provisions, including the Indenture. If our creditors, including the creditors
under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot
assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those
amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make
payments to enable the Issuer to repay the Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay
those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure
repayment of those amounts.

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to meet our obligations under our indebtedness, a_**
**_substantial amount of which will mature prior to the Notes, and to sustain our operations, which_**
**_we may not be able to generate or raise._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, a substantial amount
of which will mature prior to the Notes, and to fund our ongoing operations, will depend on our future
performance and our ability to generate cash, which is subject to general economic, financial,

which are beyond our control. The Euro Floating Rate Notes, the Euro Fixed Rate 2022 Notes and the
SEK Floating Rate Notes mature on July 15, 2022. The Euro Fixed Rate 2024 Notes mature on July 15,
2024. See “Description of the Notes.” After giving effect to the Transactions, all borrowings outstanding
as of March 31, 2017 under (i) the Intrum Justitia Existing Commercial Paper Program will mature prior
to March 31, 2018, (ii) the 2013 MTNs (as defined herein) will mature in June 2018, (iii) the 2014 MTNs
(as defined herein) will mature in May 2019, and (iv) the Lindorff Existing Loan Notes Issuance Deed
will mature in August 2022. See “Description of Other Indebtedness.” At the maturity of the Notes or
any other debt which we may incur, if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other
capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be required
to refinance such indebtedness. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness, on favorable terms, or at all,
will depend in part on our financial condition at the time of any contemplated refinancing. To the extent
we are unable to access the capital, we may be forced to modify our financing strategy or bear an
unattractive additional cost of capital, including through higher interest rates or more onerous financial
and other covenants than our current indebtedness, or other financing markets on acceptable terms,
which could decrease our profitability and reduce our financial and operational flexibility. If we are
unable to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain such refinancing on terms acceptable
to us, we may be forced to sell assets, or raise additional equity financing in amounts that could be
substantial. The type, timing and terms of any future financing will depend on our cash needs and the
then prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot assure you that we will be able to
refinance our indebtedness as it comes due on commercially acceptable terms or at all and, in
connection with the refinancing of our indebtedness, or otherwise, we may seek additional refinancing,
dispose of certain assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. We
cannot assure you that we will be able to accomplish any of these measures in a timely manner or on
commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of the agreements governing our existing
indebtedness, including, among others, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Indenture,
may limit our ability to pursue any of these measures.

**_Certain of our debt instruments bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly,_**
**_increasing our interest expenses and reducing cash flows._**

A substantial portion of our indebtedness, including the Euro Floating Rate Notes, the SEK Floating
Rate Notes, the Lindorff Existing Loan Note Issuance Deed, the Intrum Justitia Existing MTNs, the
Intrum Justitia Existing Private Placement Notes and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility,
will bear interest at _per annum rates equal to applicable IBOR, adjusted periodically, plus a spread._
These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, thereby increasing our interest expenses
associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering
the Issuer’s ability to make payments on the Notes.

**_Changes in any of the applicable IBOR calculation processes may adversely affect our finance_**
**_cost._**

The Euro Floating Rate Notes, the SEK Floating Rate Notes, the Lindorff Existing Loan Note Issuance
Deed and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at interest rates based on
applicable IBOR. Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a different measure of inter-bank
lending rates, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the EU
began conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the
calculation of daily EURIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR.
Actions by EURIBOR-EBF (the association setting the regulatory framework for the calculation of
EURIBOR), other regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in
which EURIBOR is determined. Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation
thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR, which could have an
adverse impact on our finance cost. Similar risks may be applicable to IBOR-linked borrowings and
may adversely affect our finance cost for our applicable IBOR-based borrowings.


-----

**_Our hedging agreements may expose us to credit default risks and potential losses if our hedging_**
**_counterparties fall into bankruptcy._**

We are party to currency interest rate swaps and we may enter into additional interest hedging
agreements to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. We may also enter into foreign
currency hedging arrangements to hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Under any
such agreements, we are exposed to credit risks of our counterparties. If one or more of our
counterparties falls into bankruptcy, claims we have under the swap agreements or other hedging
arrangements may become worthless. In addition, in the event that we refinance our debt or otherwise
terminate hedging agreements, we may be required to make termination payments, which would result
in a loss.

**Risks Related to the Notes**

**_The Issuer is a holding company dependent upon cash flow from subsidiaries to meet its_**
**_obligations on the Notes._**

The Issuer is a holding company with no independent business operations or significant assets other
than investments in its subsidiaries. The Issuer depends upon the receipt of sufficient funds from its
subsidiaries to meet its obligations. We intend to provide funds to the Issuer in order to meet the
obligations on the Notes through a combination of dividends and interest payments on intercompany
loans. The obligations under intercompany loans will be junior obligations and will be subordinated in
right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer or the relevant subsidiary,
including obligations under, or guarantees of obligations under, the Revolving Credit Facility.

The amounts of dividends and distributions available to the Issuer will depend on the profitability and
cash flow of its subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to issue dividends under applicable
law. The subsidiaries of the Issuer, however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted under
applicable law to, make distributions or advance upstream loans to the Issuer to make payments in
respect of its indebtedness, including the Notes. Various agreements governing our debt may restrict,
and in some cases, may actually prevent the ability of the subsidiaries to move cash within their
restricted group. Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation.

**_Claims of the secured creditors of the Issuer, such as lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility_**
**_and certain hedging agreements will have priority with respect to their collateral over the claims_**
**_of unsecured creditors, such as the holders of the Notes, to the extent of the value of the assets_**
**_securing such indebtedness._**

The Notes will not be secured by any of the Issuer’s or its subsidiaries’ assets. In the event of any
foreclosure, dissolution, winding up, liquidation, reorganization, administration or other bankruptcy or
insolvency proceeding of the Issuer at a time when it has secured obligations, holders of secured
indebtedness, including lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging arrangements,
will have priority claims to the assets of the Issuer and its subsidiaries that constitute their collateral
(other than to the extent such assets in the future also secure the Notes on an equal and ratable or
priority basis). The holders of the Notes will participate ratably with all holders of the unsecured
indebtedness of the Issuer, and potentially with all its other general creditors, based upon the
respective amounts owed to each holder or creditor, in the remaining assets of the Issuer. The claims
of holders of the Notes and other unsecured creditors will also depend on whether there is any value
left in the bankruptcy estate besides any secured assets. If any of the secured indebtedness of the
Issuer becomes due or the creditors thereunder proceed against the operating assets that secure such
indebtedness, our assets remaining after repayment of that secured indebtedness may not be
sufficient to repay all amounts owing in respect of the Notes. As a result, holders of Notes may receive
less, ratably, than holders of secured indebtedness of the Issuer and may not be able to recover the
full or any amount of their investment in the Notes. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—
_Intercreditor Agreement.”_

As of March 31, 2017, after giving _pro forma_ effect to the Transactions, we would have had an
aggregate principal amount of SEK 35 billion of debt outstanding, including SEK 890 million of secured


-----

indebtedness (excluding the SEK 305 million outstanding under the Lindorff Existing Loan Note
Issuance Deed). See “Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Capitalization.”

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities and preference shares (if any) of our_**
**_subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes._**

Initially, none of our subsidiaries will guarantee or have any obligations to pay amounts due under the
Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Generally, claims of creditors of a subsidiary,
including lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, certain hedge providers, trade
creditors, and claims of preference shareholders (if any) of the subsidiary, will have priority with respect
to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the claims of creditors of its parent entity, including
by holders of the Notes. In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation,
reorganization, administration or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of any of our subsidiaries,
holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their
claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to its
parent entity. The creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) will have no right to
proceed against the assets of such subsidiary. As such, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to
the creditors (including trade creditors) and preference shareholders (if any) of our subsidiaries. The
Indenture will provide that, in the event that the Intrum Justitia Existing MTNs and certain Eligible MTN
Replacement Indebtedness shall have been repaid in full, then, subject to certain exceptions, the
Issuer will be required to cause certain of its subsidiaries to guarantee the Notes; however, this
covenant will be subject to a number of exceptions and limitations including, amongst others, if there
are any existing contractual obligations that prohibit such guarantees. The Intrum Justitia Existing
Private Placement Notes and the Intrum Justitia Existing Commercial Paper Program currently prohibit
the provision of such guarantees and therefore the Issuer will not be under an obligation to cause any
of its subsidiaries to guarantee the Notes until such indebtedness is refinanced and such refinancing
indebtedness does not include a similar restriction. As a result, there can be no assurance that such
subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes in a timely manner after any such repayment, or at all, and you
should not rely on such potential guarantees as a basis of your investment decision. In the event any
subsidiaries of the Issuer guarantee the Notes in the future, such guarantee will be limited to the
maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant guarantor, without rendering the relevant
guarantee voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable law or without resulting in a breach of any
applicable law, and enforcement of each guarantee would be subject to certain generally available
defenses. These laws and defenses include those that relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent
conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. See
“Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by
_Restricted Subsidiaries; Future Guarantors.”_

**_The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that in certain circumstances payments in respect of the_**
**_Notes may be blocked._**

The Intercreditor Agreement will contain significant restrictions with respect to payments of the Notes.
Subject to certain limitations, if there is a payment default under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, senior debt documents or the Indenture, or if a senior payment stop notice is issued
following a non-payment event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, senior debt
documents or the Indenture, then payments under the Notes will not be permitted to be made unless
the payment is funded directly or indirectly with amounts which have not been received from the Issuer
or its restricted subsidiaries. In some circumstances, for instance where payments were received on
the Notes in breach of the Intercreditor Agreement, holders would be required to turn over such
payments to the Security Agent for redistribution. In addition, although the holders of the Notes are
generally entitled to enforce their claims against the Issuer pursuant to the terms of the Indenture,
nevertheless the Intercreditor Agreement places limits on enforcement to the extent it would prejudice
the enforcement by senior creditors of their security granted by the Issuer. See “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”_


-----

**_The insolvency laws of Sweden and other jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the U.S._**
**_bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the_**
**_Notes._**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Sweden. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
event, proceedings could be initiated in Sweden or another relevant jurisdiction. The bankruptcy,
insolvency, administrative and other laws of Sweden may be materially different from, or in conflict with,
those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and
other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceeding. The application
of Swedish laws or laws of another relevant jurisdiction, or any conflict among them, could call into
question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce
your rights under the Notes in those jurisdictions, limit any amounts that you may receive or otherwise
result in a less favorable outcome.

**_Risk related to the potential application of Spanish Non-Residents Income Tax in connection with_**
**_interest payable under the Notes._**

Interest (or any other income deemed as interest under the applicable law) derived by non-Spanish tax
resident individuals or entities could be regarded as Spanish sourced income and hence, be subject
to Spanish Non-Residents Income Tax (“NRIT”) if (i) it is paid by Spanish tax resident individuals or
entities (or by permanent establishments of non-Spanish tax residents, located in Spain) or (ii) it
remunerates the use of funds in Spain.

According to some specific guidelines issued by the Spanish tax authorities, income relating to notes
issued by a non-Spanish tax resident issuer could be regarded as remunerating the use of funds in
Spain (and thus be subject to NRIT) depending on the specific activity of the issuer and the effective
use of funds in Spain and, in particular (pursuant to these guidelines), if a non-Spanish resident special
purpose vehicle issuing the notes is incorporated by a Spanish group in order to seek finance for the
benefit of such Spanish group.

The Issuer understands that the facts described in the specific guidelines issued by the Spanish tax
authorities are not essentially similar to the present offering of Notes and therefore, their criteria should
not apply to the present offering of Notes.

In the event, though, that the Spanish tax authorities were to follow the criteria set out in these specific
guidelines, income payable by the Issuer under the Notes might be subject to NRIT at the thenapplicable rate (currently 19%). The Issuer, as a non-Spanish tax resident entity without a permanent
establishment located in Spain, does not have the status of a withholding agent pursuant to the
Spanish NRIT Law, approved by Royal Decree 5/2004, of 5 March (Real Decreto Legislativo 5/2004 de
_5 Marzo por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley del Impuesto sobre la Renta de no_
_Residentes), and therefore, any NRIT applicable to interest payments under the Notes would not be_
subject to any deduction or withholding in Spain and the holders of the Notes will be the NRIT
taxpayers of this income.

Therefore, the Issuer will not make any deduction or withholding on account of NRIT from payments
under the Notes and, consequently, the Issuer will not pay additional amounts nor indemnify the
holders of the Notes if NRIT were claimed by the competent Spanish tax authorities from such holders.
Please see “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes.” Notwithstanding the aforesaid, in case the
Spanish tax authorities were to apply this criterion to this offering of Notes, income obtained by holders
of the Notes who (i) are resident for tax purposes in a member state of the EU (with some exceptions)
or (ii) benefit from the provisions of a Double Tax Treaty entered into by Spain with such holders’
jurisdiction of tax residence pursuant to which Spain is prevented to tax such income, might be exempt
from NRIT, provided that such EU tax resident status and the entitlement to the benefits of a Double
Tax Treaty can be properly evidenced before the Spanish tax authorities (by means of the
corresponding valid tax residence certificate, or any other documentation or form required from time
to time).

Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax
consequences, under the tax laws of the country in which they are resident (including the tax
consequences under any state, local, foreign and other tax laws), of a purchase of the Notes including,
without limitation, the consequences of receipt of interest and premium, if any, on and sale or
redemption of, the Notes or any interest therein.

**_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the_**
**_Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the_**
**_Indenture._**

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of control,” the Issuer would be required
to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal
amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. If a
change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available
at such time to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other existing contractual obligations
would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in an event of
default under, acceleration of, or an obligation to mandatorily prepay the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and/or other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could
cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of
the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow them to pay cash to the holders of the Notes
following the occurrence of a change of control, may be limited by our then existing financial
resources. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited
from repurchasing the Notes by the terms of its indebtedness (or the Issuer’s subsidiaries are
prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes), we may seek
the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to
refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such consent to repay such borrowings is not
obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we
would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control.
We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer
to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute
a default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain other indebtedness. See
“Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

**_In certain circumstances, a Change of Control Offer will not be required to be made._**

The change of control provisions contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection
in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or
other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events
may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute
a “Change of Control” as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of the
_Notes—Change of Control,” the Indenture does not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to_
offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger,
recapitalization or similar transaction.

The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all
of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although
there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise
established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there
may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all
or substantially all” of the Issuer’s and its restricted subsidiaries’ assets taken as a whole. As a result,
it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required
to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.


-----

**_If the Notes are redeemed early, an investor may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a_**
**_comparable security._**

In the event that the Notes are redeemed early in accordance with the optional redemption provisions
contained in the Indenture and depending on prevailing market conditions at the time, an investor who
receives proceeds due to such an early redemption may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a
comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as that carried by the Notes. The Indenture will
allow the Issuer, at any time prior to July 15, 2018, to redeem up to €300 million equivalent in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes (on a pro rata basis for each series) at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount of the applicable series of Notes plus accrued and unpaid
interest to the redemption date and additional amounts, if any, with the net cash proceeds of any
disposals required as part of the divestment of the Carveout Business. If the Issuer exercises such
option, you may not obtain the return you expect to receive on such Notes. See “Description of the
_Notes—Optional Redemption.”_

**_The transfer of the Notes is restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price at_**
**_which they may be sold._**

The Notes have not been registered under, and we are not obliged to register the Notes under, the U.S.
Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be
offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and any other applicable laws. See “Transfer Restrictions.” We
have not agreed to or otherwise undertaken to register the Notes and we do not have any intention to
do so.

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures_**
**_of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Unless and until the Notes are in definitive registered form, or definitive registered notes are issued in
exchange for book-entry interests (which may occur only in very limited circumstances), owners of
book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of the Notes. The common depository
(or its nominee) for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the global notes
representing the applicable Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in
respect of the relevant global notes representing the Notes will be made to Citibank, N.A., London
Branch as Principal Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter,
these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the global
notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment
by the Principal Paying Agent to Euroclear and Clearstream, we will have no responsibility or liability
for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests.
Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest in the Notes, you must rely on the procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream, and if you are not a participant in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, on the
procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and
obligations of a holder of the relevant Notes under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have any direct
rights to act upon any solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of
the Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you
have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear or Clearstream, or, if applicable, from a
participant. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies
will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any matters or on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until the relevant
definitive registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry
interest, you will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. We cannot assure you that
the procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the
timely exercise of rights under the Notes.


-----

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the_**
**_Notes may be limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

- the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

- your ability to sell your Notes; or

- the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things,
prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the
market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused
substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for
the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is
subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract
different investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the
market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on
you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there
is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market
develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

An application has been made for the Notes to be listed and admitted to trading on the Exchange,
though we cannot assure you that Notes will become or remain listed. Although no assurance is made
as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of admission to trading on the Exchange, failure to be
approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an alternative admission to listing on another
stock exchange) of the Notes from the Exchange may have a material effect on a holder’s ability to
resell the Notes in the secondary market.

In addition, the Indenture will allow us to issue additional notes in the future which could adversely
impact the liquidity of the Notes.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro and Swedish Kronor. If investors measure their
investment returns by reference to a currency other than euro or Swedish kronor, as applicable, an
investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible
significant changes in the values of the currency of the applicable Notes relative to the currency by
reference to which investors measure the return on their investments because of economic, political
and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the currency of the applicable Notes
against the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments could
cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result
in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which
the investors measure the return on their investments. Investments in the Notes by U.S. investors may
also have important tax consequences as a result of foreign exchange gains or losses, if any. See “Tax
_Considerations—Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations.”_

**_You may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer and its subsidiaries are organized outside the United States, and our business is conducted
entirely outside the United States. The directors, managers and/or executive officers of the Issuer are
non-residents of the United States, and substantially all of their assets are located outside the United
States. Although the Issuer will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with
any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United
States on these directors, managers and executive officers. In addition, as substantially all of the assets
of the Issuer and its subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are located outside
of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against
them. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer may not


-----

be subject to the provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. The United States is not
currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other
than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with Sweden. There is, therefore, doubt
as to the enforceability in Sweden of U.S. securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in
such jurisdictions. In addition, the enforcement in Sweden of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court,
whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions.
There is also doubt that a court in Sweden would have the requisite power or authority to grant
remedies sought in an original action brought in such jurisdictions on the basis of U.S. securities laws
violations. See “Enforcement of Foreign Judgments and Service of Process.”

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and_**
**_may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings
may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors
discussed herein and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a
recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or
withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain
constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by
the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension,
reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the
credit rating agencies may adversely affect our access to capital, the cost and terms and conditions of
our financings and the value and trading of the Notes, which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Notes may be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

The Notes may be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If
the Notes are issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. investors in such Notes will
generally be required to include amounts representing OID in their gross income as it accrues in
advance of the receipt of cash payments attributable to such income using the constant yield method.
See “Tax Considerations—Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations.”

**Risks Related to the Transactions**

**_We may not be able to divest the Carveout Business in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, at_**
**_a reasonable price or at all._**

The European Commission approved the Merger on June 12, 2017. The approval is conditional on the
divestment of the Carveout Business, and Nordic Capital has committed to divesting the Carveout
Business in accordance with certain parameters and within the timeframe established by the European
Commission. While we anticipate being able to sell the Carveout Business as part of a competitive
process within the time permitted, there can be no assurance that we will locate acceptable buyers
willing and able to compete to purchase the Carveout Business within the time permitted by the
European Commission for its disposal. In addition, there can be no assurance that a buyer will acquire
the Carveout Business in a timely manner, on acceptable terms and at a price equal to what would
have been paid if buyers had not been aware that divestment of the Carveout Business was required
as a condition of the Merger. If we are unable to find a willing buyer for the Carveout Business within
the time permitted, a divestiture trustee will be appointed to sell the Carveout Business at no minimum
price and there can be no assurance that any such sale will be made on acceptable terms and at a
price equal to what would have been paid if the Carveout Business was not sold pursuant to such a
process.

**_The disposal of the Carveout Business involves the entry into brand licensing agreements which_**
**_expose us to reputational and other risks._**

The disposal of the Carveout Business includes the disposal of all tangible and intangible assets of the
applicable businesses and includes a requirement to enter into three-year brand licensing agreements


-----

with the purchaser for the “Lindorff” brand in Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Estonia and the “Intrum
Justitia” brand in Norway. Following the disposal of the Carveout Business, we may not be able to
control the use of such brands in the jurisdictions subject to the licensing agreements and cannot
assure you that the licensee under any such agreement will refrain from operating the Carveout
Business in a manner that would cause reputational damage to the Company. Any of the risks
associated with our lack of control over any such licensee, or their use of the Lindorff or Intrum Justitia
brands, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of
operations.

**_The completion of the Merger may be subject to litigation that, if realized, may result in a material_**
**_adverse effect on, including delay in completion of, the Merger._**

The Merger may be subject to litigation risks that are frequently faced by parties in connection with
transactions of this type, including challenges by dissenting shareholders of Intrum Justitia. Plaintiffs
in any such litigation action may seek, among other remedies, compensatory damages (which may
involve claims for a significant amount of monetary damages). The outcome of any such suit is
inherently uncertain. As a result, we cannot assure you that any such litigation will not result in payment
of settlement amounts, award of monetary damages against the relevant parties to any such lawsuit or
grant of other remedies, any one of which may be material in amount and may have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

**_Anticipated synergies from the Merger may not materialize._**

As a result of the Merger, we expect to achieve certain synergies discussed elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum relating to our operations. Among the synergies that we currently expect are operational
synergies from optimization of operations centers, consolidation of administrative and support
functions, harmonization of IT systems and application development/maintenance and increased scale
in procurement.

Our ability to realize any or all of the anticipated synergies of the Merger depends on a variety of factors
and may be affected by legal, regulatory and contractual restrictions. Although our anticipated
synergies presented in this Offering Memorandum give estimated effect to the disposal of the Carveout
Business, there can be no assurance these estimates are correct, and the actual effect of the disposal
of the Carveout Business may further reduce or eliminate the synergies we currently anticipate as a
result of the Merger. See “Summary—Divestment of the Carveout Business.”

Other external factors beyond our control, such as systemic failures in our industry or the industry
sectors of our clients and changes in fiscal and monetary policies, may impact our ability to realize the
expected synergies in connection with the Merger. Our estimated synergies from the Merger are
subject to a number of assumptions about the timing, execution and costs associated with realizing
the synergies. There can be no assurance that such assumptions turn out to be correct and, as a
result, the amount of synergies that we will actually realize over time may differ significantly from the
ones that we currently estimate. We may also incur significant costs in integrating Intrum Justitia and
Lindorff and in disposing of the Carveout Business. Such integration and disposal costs, as applicable,
may be higher than expected. In addition, to the extent we determine that actions required to be taken
to achieve any such synergies could disrupt or otherwise harm the ongoing operation of our business,
or the costs associated with realizing any such synergies outweigh the anticipated benefits, we may
decide to take alternative actions or forego the achievement of those synergies. Failure to achieve the
expected synergies as currently anticipated may have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition or results of operations.

**_The integration of Intrum Justitia and Lindorff and the disposal of the Carveout Business as a_**
**_condition of approving the Merger could result in operating difficulties and other adverse_**
**_consequences._**

The integration of Intrum Justitia and Lindorff and the disposal of the Carveout Business as anticipated
may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and pose significant management,
administrative and financial challenges to our business. These challenges include:


-----

- integration of Lindorff’s and Intrum Justitia’s, and disposal of the Carveout Business and any other
businesses from Lindorff’s and Intrum Justitia’s, current businesses in a cost effective manner,
including operations centers, IT infrastructure, data analytic capacities, management information
and financial control systems, procurement, marketing, branding, customer service and product
offerings;

- disposal of the Carveout Business in a manner that does not disrupt our operations;

- any revenue disynergies due to the overlapping client base and service offerings of Intrum Justitia
and Lindorff;

- restrictions on our ability to compete for clients that were clients of the Carveout Business on
June 12, 2017, due to non-solicitation clauses in the commitments agreed with the European
Commission, which apply from the date of the European Commission’s decision (June 12, 2017)
until the date that is 24 months after the divestment of the Carveout Business;

- outstanding or unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual, labor or other issues arising from the
Merger and the disposal of the Carveout Business;

- integration of different company and management cultures;

- restrictions on our ability to solicit key personnel, sales and customer relations employees,
account managers, purchased debt analysts and other important personnel that were employees
of the Carveout Business on June 12, 2017, due to non-solicitation clauses in the commitments
agreed with the European Commission, which will apply for a period of 30 months after the
divestment of the Carveout Business; and

- retention, hiring and training of key personnel.

In such circumstances, our failure to effectively integrate Intrum Justitia and Lindorff and dispose of the
Carveout Business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results
of operations. In addition, the Merger and disposal of the Carveout Business may generate higher than
expected integration, or disposal, costs, as applicable, as a result of unforeseen risks or liabilities or
as a result of delays, or other financial and operational difficulties. Any difficulties encountered in the
integration of Intrum Justitia and Lindorff or the disposal of the Carveout Business could result in higher
implementation costs and/or lower benefits or revenue than anticipated, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition or result of operations.

Moreover, the Merger has required, and the Merger and the disposal of the Carveout Business will
likely continue to require, substantial amounts of certain of our management’s time and focus, which
could potentially affect their ability to operate the business.

**_In connection with the disposal of the Carveout Business, in certain circumstances the Issuer will_**
**_not be required to comply with the covenant limiting the sales of assets and subsidiary stock._**

The Indenture will contain several exceptions to the covenant limiting the sales of assets and subsidiary
stock including, amongst other things, an exception permitting the Issuer to make certain asset
dispositions in connection with the disposal of the Carveout Business, provided that the fair market
value of any such assets in the aggregate does not exceed 6.0% of the pro forma total assets of the
Company (calculated in accordance with the Indenture). See “Description of the Notes—Limitation on
_Assets and Subsidiary Stock.” Accordingly, the Issuer will not be required to comply with fair market_
value, minimum cash consideration or application of proceeds requirements imposed by the covenant
limiting sales of assets and subsidiary stock, in each case up to such specified amount. As a result of
this and other exceptions to the covenant limiting sales of assets and subsidiary stock, the Issuer may
not be required to offer to purchase the Notes following any such sale or disposition.

### USE OF PROCEEDS

The gross proceeds of the offering of the Notes are approximately SEK 28,775 million (€3,014 million
equivalent). We have used the gross proceeds from the offering of the Notes along with amounts
drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility to fund the Refinancing Transactions. See “Summary—The
_Transactions.”_

For descriptions of our anticipated indebtedness after giving effect to the Transactions, see “Capitalization.”

The following table sets forth our estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the
Refinancing Transactions assuming the Refinancing Transactions were completed on June 30, 2017.
Actual amounts may vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including fluctuations
in currency exchange rates, the date of completion of the Merger and the Refinancing Transactions,
amounts outstanding under the Intrum Justitia Existing Revolving Credit Facility and the Lindorff
Existing Revolving Credit Facility as of the Completion Date and differences between estimated and
actual fees and expenses. In addition, the estimated financing costs and transaction costs presented
in this table represent total costs and have not been adjusted to account for any such costs that have
already been recognized in the Issuer’s unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three
months ended March 31, 2017 and the Issuer’s audited consolidated financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2016.

employee costs of €4 million and €1 million, respectively, that were not included in the employee benefit expense of
Lindorff AB.

(2)  For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the other operating costs of Lock Lower Holding included consultancy
fees of €3 million and €3 million, respectively, that were not included in the other operating costs of Lindorff AB.

(3)  Net finance costs consist of interest on loans from financial institutions, fair value gains and losses on financial derivatives

in the case of Lindorff AB, (i) prior to the completion of the Prior Lindorff Acquisition, interest expense on certain
subordinated loans, or (ii) following the completion of the Prior Lindorff Acquisition, the intercompany proceeds loans
received from affiliates; and (b) in the case of Lock Lower Holding, interest expense on the Lindorff Existing Debt. On
October 6, 2014, upon completion of the Prior Lindorff Acquisition, Lock AS made an intercompany proceeds loan of

AB’s Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum. As a result, the net finance costs of Lock Lower Holding may not be comparable to the net finance costs of

### UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF THE COMPANY

The Unaudited _Pro Forma Financial Information of the Company has been prepared to reflect the_
Issuer’s acquisition of 100% of the share capital of Lock TopCo AS in connection with the Merger and
the related Refinancing Transactions. The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information of the Company
does not give effect to the potential impact of divesting the Carveout Business on the Company.
See “Summary—Divestment of the Carveout Business.”

The Issuer has prepared the following Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information:

- unaudited pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2016 to illustrate the
effect that the Transactions might have had on the Issuer if they had been completed on January
1, 2016 for purposes of presenting an unaudited pro forma income statement;

- unaudited _pro forma financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2016, to_
illustrate the effect that the Transactions might have had on the Issuer if they had been
completed on January 1, 2016 for purposes of presenting an unaudited pro forma statement ;

- unaudited _pro forma financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2017, to_
illustrate the effect that the Transactions might have had on the Issuer if they had been
completed on January 1, 2016 for purposes of presenting an unaudited _pro forma income_
statement;

- unaudited _pro forma financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2017, to_
illustrate the effect that the Transactions might have had on the Issuer if they had been
completed on January 1, 2016 for purposes of presenting an unaudited _pro forma income_
statement; and

- unaudited pro forma financial information as of March 31, 2017, to illustrate the effect that the
Transactions might have had on the Issuer if they had been completed on March 31, 2017 for
purposes of presenting an unaudited pro forma balance sheet for this period.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information has been included to describe a hypothetical situation,
has been prepared for illustrative purposes only, and both the Unaudited _Pro Forma Financial_
Information and the assumptions underlying the _pro forma adjustments described below should be_
read in conjunction with the information contained in “Selected Historical Consolidated Financial and
_Other Data,” “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations_
_of Intrum Justitia,” “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of_
_Operations of Lindorff”, the Issuer’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year_
ended December 31, 2016, the Issuer’s Interim Financial Statements, Lock Lower Holding’s audited
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 and Lock Lower
Holding’s Interim Financial Statements, each included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The
Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information does not include all of the information required for financial
statements under IFRS and does not include a cash flow statement for any period.

The Merger will be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 Business combinations (“IFRS 3”). The
allocations of the preliminary purchase price as reflected in the Unaudited _Pro Forma Financial_
Information have been based upon preliminary estimates of the total consideration transferred for the
acquisition of the Lindorff share capital and preliminary estimates of the fair value of the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed of Lock Lower Holding. A final determination of the fair value of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed of Lock Lower Holding will be based on the actual assets and
liabilities of Lock Lower Holding that exist at the Completion Date. Such valuations could change upon
the completion of further analyses and asset valuations from those used in the Unaudited Pro Forma
Financial Information. The final valuation will be completed following the Completion Date and is
subject to change based on timing of the Completion Date.

Moreover, the Unaudited _Pro Forma Financial Information may not necessarily reflect the Issuer’s_
actual results of operations and/or financial condition if the Transactions had actually been completed
on such earlier date and such Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information should not be considered to


-----

be indicative of the Issuer’s results of operations or financial condition for any future period. The
Unaudited _Pro Forma Financial Information has not been prepared in accordance with the_
requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act, applicable EU regulations or any generally
accepted accounting standards. Accordingly, potential investors should not pay undue attention to the
Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information.

**Basis of preparation**

**_Preparation Principles_**

The Unaudited _Pro Forma Financial Information appearing herein presents the_ _pro forma financial_
position and results from operations of the Company derived from the historical consolidated financial
information of the Issuer after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions based on certain assumptions
as described in these notes.

The historical consolidated financial information of the Issuer has been adjusted to give effect to
_pro forma adjustments that are directly attributable to the Transactions and factually supportable. The_
Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information does not reflect anticipated revenue or cost synergies that
may be achieved by the Transactions. The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information is based upon
currently available information, estimates and _pro forma assumptions that we currently believe are_
reasonable. Any of the factors underlying these estimates and pro forma assumptions may change or
prove to be materially different from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the Unaudited
_Pro Forma Financial Information, and these estimates and assumptions may not be representative of_
facts existing at the closing of the Transactions. Except as described herein, the Unaudited Pro Forma
Financial Information of the Company does not reflect any changes in the business of the Issuer or
Lock Lower Holding since March 31, 2017.

The accounting principles applied for the preparation of the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information
are as follows:

**_Historical Financial Information_**

The Unaudited _Pro Forma Financial Information is based on the following historical financial_
information:

- the Issuer’s audited consolidated financial statements of and for the year ended December 31,
2016;

- the Issuer’s Interim Financial Statements;

- Lock Lower Holding’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2016; and

- Lock Lower Holding’s Interim Financial Statements.

The accounting policies of the Issuer were used to prepare the Unaudited _Pro Forma Financial_
Information. See Note 1 in the Issuer’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2016 included elsewhere herein for more information regarding the Issuer’s
accounting policies. There are no material differences between the accounting policies of the Issuer
and Lock Lower Holding. Other than as described elsewhere in this Basis of Preparation section, no
significant adjustments were made to the historical financial information of the Issuer or Lock Lower
Holding in preparing the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information. In particular, no adjustment was
made to account for the intercompany liabilities of Lock Topco AS including the liability of €30 million
in favor of Lock Lower Holding.

**_Currency Conversion_**

The historical financial information of Lock Lower Holding has been converted from euro to SEK using
average Sveriges Riksbank Daily Reference Rates for the period for figures appearing in the pro forma
income statements and using the Sveriges Riksbank Daily Reference Rate as of the relevant date for
figures appearing in the pro forma balance sheet.


-----

When necessary, average Sveriges Riksbank Daily Reference Rates for the relevant periods were used
for purposes of translating pro forma adjustments to the income statements and pro forma adjustments
that are expected to have a continuing effect on the Company into SEK. The Sveriges Riksbank Daily
Reference Rate as of the relevant date was used when necessary to translate pro forma adjustments
to the balance sheet and pro forma adjustments that are expected to have a one-time effect into SEK.

For more information regarding these exchange rates, see “Exchange Rates.”

**_Accounting for the Merger_**

The Merger is accounted for as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3. According to
IFRS 3, the actual initial consolidation of a business combination takes place at the acquisition date,
i.e. the time at which the acquiring company obtains control of the acquired company or acquired
business operation. Due to the accounting for the Merger as a business combination in accordance
with IFRS 3, the purchase price as well as the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed
of Lock Lower Holding must be measured at their acquisition date fair values in accordance with IFRS.

A preliminary purchase price allocation of Lock Lower Holding was undertaken for purposes of
calculating the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information. The purchase price for the shares in Lock
Lower Holding was calculated as the fair value of the new shares issued by Intrum Justitia in
connection with the Merger, based on the closing share price for Intrum Justitia’s share as of March
31, 2017, which was SEK 334.50 per share. Accordingly, the total fair value of the newly issued shares,
and consequently the estimated purchase price for the shares of Lock Lower Holding acquired in
connection with the Merger, will be approximately SEK 19,800 million.

We concluded that the carrying values of assets in the balance sheet of Lock Lower Holding as of
March 31, 2017 reflected their fair values in all material respects, and that the carrying values of
liabilities in the balance sheet of Lock Lower Holding as of March 31, 2017 fell short of their fair value
by SEK 1,333 million. This fair value adjustment to Lock Lower Holding’s liabilities relates to the break
fees which we expect to pay and capitalized borrowing costs we expect to write-off in connection with
repayment of the Lindorff Existing Debt. We recognized as additional goodwill in the pro forma balance
sheet of the Company an amount equal to the difference between (a) the fair value of the new issued
shares, approximately SEK 19,800 million, and (b) the reported shareholders’ equity of Lock Lower
Holding as of March 31, 2017, SEK 7,270 million, less the amount of SEK 1,333 million reflecting the
adjustment to Lock Lower Holding’s liabilities described above, plus a tax impact of SEK 293 million
corresponding to 22% of SEK 1,333 million and less the deduction to Lock Lower Holding’s
shareholders’ equity of SEK 264 million corresponding to the dividend to pay transaction-related costs
described below. Total goodwill from the Transactions recognized in the Company’s _pro forma_
statement of financial position therefore amounts to SEK 32,176 million.

**_Transaction-Related Costs_**

Legal, consulting and other fees incurred by the Issuer in connection with the Merger were classified
as transaction-related costs. For purposes of calculating the Unaudited _Pro Forma Financial_
Information, these costs were assumed incurred as of January 1, 2016 and, therefore, were recognized
as expenses in the unaudited _pro forma consolidated income statement for the three-month period_
ended March 31, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2016, but were not recognized as expenses
in the unaudited pro forma consolidated income statement for the three months ended March 31, 2017
or the twelve months ended March 31, 2017.

Transaction-related costs to be borne by the Issuer in connection with the Merger are estimated to
amount to SEK 171 million, of which SEK 37 million had been incurred as of March 31, 2017, of which
SEK 30 million had been incurred in the year ended December 31, 2016 and SEK 7 million had been
incurred in the three months ended March 31, 2017 and are therefore reflected in the Issuer’s income
statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 and the three months ended March 31, 2017,
respectively. To prepare the unaudited _pro forma income statements in accordance with the_
preparation principles stated above, we adjusted the relevant historical financial information of the
Issuer to give pro forma effect to the SEK 37 million of transaction-related costs as if these costs had
been incurred on January 1, 2016.


-----

In addition to the SEK 171 million of transaction-related costs incurred by the Issuer, the owners of Lock
Lower Holding are assumed to incur transaction related costs of SEK 264 million, which have been
agreed to be financed through a dividend in the same amount from Lock TopCo AS prior to the Merger.
The amount SEK 264 million has therefore been deducted from the shareholders’ equity of Lock Lower
Holding in the other transaction adjustments column of the pro forma balance sheet below.

**_Financing-Related Costs_**

Financing-related costs attributable to the Transactions include costs of SEK 292 million associated
with arranging bridge financing in connection with the Refinancing Transactions, SEK 131 million
associated with arranging the Revolving Credit Facility and SEK 307 million associated with the offering
and sale of the Notes. Financing-related costs attributable to the bridge financing were assumed to
have been incurred on January 1, 2016 and were not recognized in the unaudited _pro forma_
consolidated income statements for the twelve months ended March 31, 2017 and the three months
ended March 31, 2017 as a result. Financing-related costs attributable to the Revolving Credit Facility
and the Notes were capitalized and amortized over the expected respective life of the financing
arrangements (assumed to be a period of five years) in accordance with IAS 39, whereby the annual
cost is SEK 88 million.

**_Interest Cost_**

We adjusted the pro forma consolidated income statements of the Company to reflect the difference
in interest cost between actual interest costs incurred during the period and interest costs expected to
be realized as a result of the Refinancing Transactions for the relevant periods giving pro forma effect
to such interest costs as if the Refinancing Transactions had been completed on January 1, 2016.
Interest cost for each period has been calculated by aggregating the interest expense for such period
in respect of the Notes (assuming a three-month EURIBOR of 0% with respect to the Euro Floating Rate
Notes and a three-month STIBOR of 0% with respect to the SEK Floating Rate Notes), plus the interest
expense on the portion of the Revolving Credit Facility that is expected to be drawn in connection with
the Transactions and the commitment fee on the undrawn portion thereof, plus the interest expense in
respect of the Intrum Justitia Existing MTNs, the Intrum Justitia Existing Private Placement Notes, the
Intrum Justitia Existing Commercial Paper Program and the Lindorff Existing Loan Note Issuance Deed
(including interest expense on the amount drawn as of March 31, 2017 and the commitment fee on the
undrawn portion thereof) that will remain outstanding following completion of the Transactions.

**_Operating Segments, Service Lines and Results by Geographic Region_**

The segments and geographic regions historically used by Lindorff in Lindorff’s Financial Statements
and internal reporting differ from those historically used by the Issuer in the Issuer’s Financial
Statements and internal reporting. In order to present pro forma financial results by service line and
geographic region for the Company, we recalculated Lock Lower Holding’s results by segment and
geographic region in accordance with operating service lines and geographical regions that may
approximate the service lines and geographic regions the Company will use following the Merger.
However, the Company’s operating segments and geographical regions have not been determined,
and the actual service lines and geographic regions used by the Company following the Merger may
differ significantly from those used herein. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—
_Segments, Service Lines and Geographical Regions.”_

**_Other Significant Assumptions_**

- The gross proceeds to be received from the Notes is assumed to be SEK 28,775 million
(€3,014 million equivalent). It is further assumed that no amounts are drawn under the bridge
financing.

- For purposes of calculating the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information, we gave effect to the
Refinancing Transactions as if they occurred on January 1, 2016 but we assumed break costs
and other costs associated with the Refinancing Transactions would equal the costs we actually
expect to incur in connection with the Refinancing Transactions rather than the amount such


-----

costs would have been under the then-applicable redemption provisions had the Refinancing
Transactions occurred on January 1, 2016.

- A tax rate reflecting the current corporate tax rate of 22 per cent in Sweden has been assumed
for all transactions expected to have a tax impact.

(a)  Adjustments to give _pro forma effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2016 to the Intrum_
Justitia AB (publ) income statement line items for the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of the following:

   -   An adjustment of SEK (141) million was made to sales, marketing and administration expenses for the period
reflecting transaction costs for the Merger in excess of those already included in the Issuer’s income statement
for the period. This adjustment was reversed in the Issuer Adjustments column of the Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
reconciliation table to exclude costs related to the Transactions from Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA.

   -   An adjustment of SEK (19) million was made to net financial items for the period comprised of an adjustment of
SEK (292) million associated with the costs of arranging bridge financing in connection with the Refinancing
Transactions and an adjustment of SEK 273 million reflecting changes in interest cost and other financial items
including the expense related to capitalized financing-related costs described in “—Financing-Related Costs.”
These adjustments were reversed in the Issuer Adjustments column of the _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA_
reconciliation table to exclude net financial items from Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA.

   -   An adjustment of SEK 35 million was made to income tax expense for the period reflecting the tax impact of the
adjustments to sales, marketing and administration expenses and net financial items. This adjustment was
reversed in the Issuer Adjustments column of the Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation table to exclude taxes
from Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA.

items, depreciation and amortization of non-financial assets and amortization and revaluation of purchased debt, further
adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain non-recurring items after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions as if they
had occurred on January 1, 2016.

(a)  Adjustments to give _pro forma effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2016 to the Intrum_
Justitia AB (publ) income statement line items consisted of the following:

  -   An adjustment of SEK 37 million was made to sales, marketing and administration expenses for the period
reflecting transaction costs for the Merger that were reflected in the Issuer’s income statement for the period but
are assumed to have occurred on January 1, 2016 for purposes of calculating the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial
Information. This adjustment was reversed in the Issuer Adjustments column of the Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
reconciliation table to exclude costs related to the Transactions from Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA.

   -   An adjustment of SEK 389 million was made to net financial items for the period reflecting changes in interest cost
and other financial items including the expense related to capitalized financing-related costs described in “—
_Financing-Related Costs.” This adjustments was reversed in the Issuer Adjustments column of the_ _Pro Forma_
Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation table to exclude net financial items from Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA.

   -   An adjustment of SEK (94) million was made to income tax expense for the period reflecting the tax impact of the
adjustments to sales, marketing and administration expenses and net financial items. This adjustment was
reversed in the Issuer Adjustments column of the Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation table to exclude taxes
from Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA.

### MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF INTRUM JUSTITIA

_The following is a discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the_
_Issuer. The discussion and analysis of the Issuer is based on its unaudited interim consolidated financial_
_statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 and its audited consolidated_
_financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, in each case,_
_prepared in accordance with IFRS. Except as expressly provided, this discussion and analysis of the_
_results of operations and financial condition of the Issuer does not give effect to the potential impact of_
_divesting the Carveout Business on the Issuer. See “Summary—Divestment of the Carveout Business.”_

_You should read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the_
_accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. A summary of the critical_
_accounting estimates that have been applied to the Issuer’s consolidated financial statements is set_
_forth below in “—Significant Accounting Policies.” You should also review the information in the section_
_“Presentation of Financial and Other Information.” This discussion also includes forward-looking_
_statements which, although based on assumptions that Intrum Justitia consider reasonable, are subject_
_to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual events or conditions to differ materially from those_
_expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties_
_facing Intrum Justitia as a result of various factors, see “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk_
_Factors.”_

**Overview**

Upon completion of the Merger, we will be the leading credit management provider in Europe by
revenue, EBITDA and carrying value of purchased debt, with operations in 23 European countries and
a leading position in a majority of those countries. Intrum Justitia and Lindorff each provide a balanced
and integrated mix of services across the entire credit management value chain, including financial
services, and each company has a longstanding commitment to fair collection. Following the Merger,
we will benefit from greater scale of our operations and complementary sector expertise in debt
originated by the trade sector and the financial institutions sector, respectively. Using the existing
expertise of Intrum Justitia and Lindorff, we will provide:

- **_Credit Management Services (“CMS”). We employ tailored debt collection strategies and_**
solutions to maximize cash flow streams from loans and other overdue receivables for clients who
have decided to outsource their debt collection function. On a pro forma combined basis for the
twelve months ended March 31, 2017, we would have generated net revenue of SEK 6,922 million
(€728 million equivalent) from CMS, excluding revenue generated from portfolios of loans and
other overdue receivables that we own. As part of our CMS services, Lindorff has leading
capabilities in alternative solutions, such as carve-outs, which involves taking over the in-house
collection platform of financial institutions clients and conducting debt collection on behalf of the
financial institutions under a long-term contract. Lindorff also provides real estate servicing
(“RES”), which involves servicing of loans related to properties and other services related to the
security/property owned by its clients in Spain.

In addition to, and generally in combination with, collection services, we provide clients with a
wide range of value-added services, prior to loans and receivables becoming overdue, including
customer and credit information and analysis on individuals and companies across Europe to
help our clients assess their potential customers’ payment capacity, data extraction and
modelling, selection and scoring of potential customers, and a full suite of services relating to
accounts receivable, including invoicing, reminders and account ledger services.

- **_Financial Services. We offer a range of financial services. In particular, we purchase portfolios of_**
secured and unsecured loans and other overdue receivables from our clients for a portion of the
nominal value, which we then service using our in-house debt collection function, with a few
exceptions. Following the purchase of the defaulted receivables, our long-term debt collection
measures commence, aimed at helping consumers become debt-free as we help them reduce


-----

their debt in a respectful manner, for example through installment plans that take account of each
consumer’s payment capacity. On a _pro forma_ combined basis for the twelve months ended
March 31, 2017, we would have generated net revenue of SEK 5,934 million (€624 million
equivalent) from Financial Services and, on a combined basis as of March 31, 2017, the ERC of
our portfolios of loans and overdue receivables would have been SEK 46,704 million
(€4,892 million equivalent), with a total collectible value on purchased debt of SEK 405,190
million (€42,444 million equivalent). As part of our Financial Services offering, we also provide
factoring, payment guarantees and e-commerce services.

We believe that the combination of debt collection and purchasing has been and will be key to Intrum
Justitia’s and Lindorff’s, and our continued, success. The range of services helps attract and retain
clients and increases the breadth and depth of collectible data, in turn supporting the creation of
tailored collection strategies and development of analytical capabilities to enable more accurate
pricing of portfolios. Operating across Europe and with a balanced business model also gives us
investment optionality as we can allocate resources across our platform and jurisdictions to the
opportunities that we find most attractive. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2017, our pro forma
net revenue and Pro Forma Further Adjusted EBITDA was SEK 12,856 million and SEK 9,254 million,
respectively (€1,352 million and €973 million equivalent, respectively). See “Summary Consolidated
_Pro Forma Financial and Other Data of the Company—Pro Forma and Other Information of the_
_Company” and “Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information of the Company.”_

To address competition concerns raised by the European Commission following its initial investigation
of the Merger, Nordic Capital has committed to divesting the Carveout Business. See “Summary—
_Divestment of the Carveout Business.”_

**Key Factors Affecting Intrum Justitia’s Results of Operations**

Intrum Justitia’s business and results of operations, as well as the key operating metrics discussed
below, have been, and are expected to continue to be, affected by certain key factors including, in
particular, the volume of clients outsourcing their credit optimization and collection requirements and
the level of debt available for purchase, purchases of debt portfolios at the right price, competition and
pricing, gross collection levels, collection costs and operational efficiency, cost saving measures,
seasonality, acquisitions and geographic expansion, economic conditions, foreign currency effects
and tax effects. Each of these factors is discussed in more detail below.

**_Volume of Clients Outsourcing their Credit Optimization and Collection Requirements and the_**
**_Level of Debt Available for Purchase_**

Providing an integrated service offering throughout the credit management chain is key to attracting
and retaining clients. Intrum Justitia believes that onboarding clients at the outset of their transaction
processes, through the provision of credit optimization and collection services, has been crucial to its
success. Intrum Justitia’s results of operations are linked to the volume of companies seeking to
outsource their credit-related offerings, as well as the overall level of loans and other overdue
receivables available for purchase and for third-party collection in the markets and industry sectors in
which it operates. During the periods under review, the volume of credit optimization and collection
services that Intrum Justitia provides and the volume of loans and other overdue receivables sold has
increased. Intrum Justitia believes that this development will continue due to three main factors: (a) an
increasing expectation for businesses to offer alternatives to direct, one-off payments and, therefore,
an increasing number of businesses looking to offer alternative payment methods to remain
competitive in their respective markets; (b) an increased propensity to sell NPLs and other overdue
receivables due to regulatory pressure for organizations to delever, combined with a preference for
improved and predictable cash flows; and (c) an increase in the number of organizations outsourcing
credit optimization and collection services and selling debt as they refocus their businesses by exiting
non-core operations, such as in-house debt collection, where there exists an increasing sophistication
gap compared with the competencies of credit management providers. During the periods under
review, Intrum Justitia benefited from these trends and was able to expand its operations and increase
its results of operations.


-----

**_Purchases of Debt Portfolios at the Right Price_**

Intrum Justitia’s ability to purchase portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables at the right price
has been a key driver of its results of operations in the periods under review and will continue to be a
key driver going forward. Purchased debt consists mainly of portfolios of loans and other overdue
receivables purchased at prices significantly below the nominal total collectible value on purchased
debt and which are recognized at amortized cost. Intrum Justitia expects to achieve collections in
excess of the portfolio purchase price and as of, March 31, 2017 its ERC was 2.0 times its carrying
value of purchased debt.

When purchasing portfolios, Intrum Justitia engages in an extensive valuation of the portfolio in order
to determine what price it should offer the client, see “Business—Intrum Justitia: Operations and
_Service Offerings—Financial Services—Purchase of overdue receivables.” Intrum Justitia’s_
performance is dependent on its ability to purchase portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables
that meet its investment criteria, including prices that generate an appropriate return on purchased
debt. After purchasing a portfolio, its performance is further dependent on its ability to generate gross
collection levels at, or in excess of, its expectations for that portfolio. For the years ended December
31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, Intrum Justitia’s average annual collection of forecast was 114%, 110% and
110%, respectively. Intrum Justitia has recently expanded the scope of its investments within new asset
classes. For example, in October 2016, Intrum Justitia acquired a large portfolio from Erste Bank of
Hungary, consisting of consumer NPLs secured by real estate. As of March 31, 2017, 5% of its
purchased debt book value consisted of secured loans. Secured loans entail some additional
complexity with respect to pricing and forecasting. For example, secured loans have different risk and
collection profiles than the unsecured loans and receivables that have historically been its main focus.

The global financial crisis reduced the propensity of debt originators to sell overdue receivables as
prices decreased and also led to difficulties for debt purchasers to obtain funding for purchases of
portfolios in 2008 and 2009. During this period, collection levels on certain portfolios decreased in
some countries, thus reducing overall portfolio performance. This impacted not only the pricing of new
portfolios, but also existing portfolios that debt purchasers owned at the time and which were typically
secured under existing funding arrangements. Intrum Justitia was partly shielded from these
challenging market conditions due to its balanced offering, particularly its debt collection services. Due
to its full service business model, it was able to adapt its business mix and meet this client demand.
Pure debt purchasers, who lacked in-house debt collection operations, were unable to react in this
manner. Similarly, when the markets started to recover again in 2010, and pricing levels became
increasingly attractive for sellers, Intrum Justitia was able to respond rapidly by increasing portfolio
purchases. Intrum Justitia believes that its balanced business model allows it to adapt to a changing
market environment and the dynamics of supply.

From January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2016, Intrum Justitia invested SEK 7,465 million to purchase
portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables, including deliveries under forward flow agreements,
which had an aggregate total collectible value of SEK 85,396 million. As of December 31, 2016 and
March 31, 2017, 79% and 82%, respectively, of the total collectible value on purchased debt of Intrum
Justitia’s portfolio across its geographic markets consisted of NPLs originated from financial
institutions, 13% and 12%, respectively, from telecommunications clients, 2% and 2%, respectively,
from utility-provider clients and 6% and 5%, respectively, from other industries. As of December 31,
2016, 2015 and 2014, Intrum Justitia had ERC of SEK 17,914 million, SEK 14,537 million and SEK
12,824 million, respectively, and as of March 31, 2017 and 2016 it had ERC of SEK 21,681 million and
SEK 15,080 million, respectively. The carrying value of purchased debt in Intrum Justitia’s consolidated
statement of financial position was SEK 8,733 million, SEK 7,027 million and SEK 6,197 million,
respectively, as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, and SEK 10,623 million and SEK 7,403 million,
respectively, as of March 31, 2017 and 2016.

The table below presents information on the portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables that
Intrum Justitia purchased during the periods under review. In any period, it purchases portfolios that
can vary in age, type and ultimate collectability, which results in period-to-period variation in the price
paid as a percentage of total collectible value on purchased debt.

There are two principal models for purchasing portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables:
one-off agreements and forward flow agreements. The majority of portfolios for sale are currently
offered to the market through competitive tender processes. In a one-off agreement, Intrum Justitia
agrees to buy a portfolio of claims that it receives in one transaction upon payment. In a forward flow
agreement, it agrees to buy claims at a pre-defined price or price range for a given volume and quality
from a client on an ongoing basis. Forward flow agreements are beneficial to business because they
offer a predictable and certain flow of claims. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014,
Intrum Justitia had invested SEK 497 million, SEK 687 million and SEK 620 million, respectively, in
forward flow agreements and, and for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, it had
invested SEK 183 million and SEK 136 million, respectively, in forward flow agreements. Forward flow
agreements are typically not long-term contracts. Although Intrum Justitia’s current forward flow
agreements, in terms of their nature, provide no medium- to long-term assurance on purchasing levels,
most of these contracts are with existing partners with whom it has established relationships and it
expects that many of these contracts will be renewed based on its experience with such contracts in
the past.

Intrum Justitia’s ability to purchase portfolios is dependent on its internally generated funding
resources and its access to financing at the time portfolios become available for purchase. Intrum
Justitia currently funds its purchases of portfolios, working capital needs and other expenditures with
cash generated from its operating activities and borrowings under the Intrum Justitia Existing
Revolving Credit Facility or from additional bank and capital markets debt. Intrum Justitia believes that
it will be able to continue to obtain financing (bank debt as well as capital markets debt) subject to
market conditions. See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional information on the funding
of Intrum Justitia’s portfolio purchases and see “—Overview—Economic Conditions” for additional
information on the effects of economic conditions on Intrum Justitia’s business and results of
operations.

**_Competition and Pricing_**

Competition and pricing levels in the markets in which Intrum Justitia operates affects its ability to
successfully and profitably offer credit optimization, payment, collection and financial services. The
European credit management market is fragmented, consisting of several thousand companies with
varied profiles. The pricing element of debt purchase and debt collection services has become, and
continues to be, increasingly competitive across all markets and resulted in increased pricing levels for
such purchases and decreased pricing levels for such services during the periods under review. In
recent years, Intrum Justitia believes that there has been a trend towards increased concentration of
the credit management industry with credit management companies, such as itself, Lindorff, Hoist
Finance and Portfolio Recovery Associates (due to their acquisition of Aktiv Kapital), expanding in scale
as core clients, in particular financial institutions, are increasingly placing value on high-quality data
assets acquired over an extended period of time, a robust compliance framework, a multinational
presence and long-term relationships with credit management companies. In addition, reputation and
ethical behavior are important competitive advantages in order to maintain relationships with current
and potential clients, especially financial institutions.

The global financial crisis led to unattractive pricing levels for purchases of portfolios in 2008 and 2009,
mainly as a result of reduced ability of customers to repay their debt, reduced propensity of debt
originators to sell overdue receivables and difficulties for debt purchasers to obtain funding, but
markets started to recover again in 2010 and pricing levels have been advantageous during the
periods under review. Unlike companies that do not offer debt collection services, Intrum Justitia’s


-----

balanced operations provide an efficient tool in this competitive landscape. Since Intrum Justitia
generates steady revenue and cash flow from its credit optimization, payment and collection services,
it can selectively choose which portfolios to bid for and does not have to purchase portfolios it believes
are priced too high simply to ensure sufficient cash flow into its operations. In this competitive
landscape, Intrum Justitia’s EBITDA margin has improved from 33% in the year ended December 31,
2014 to 35% in the year ended December 31, 2016. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry
_and Business—We are active in competitive markets and may be unable to continue to successfully_
_compete with businesses that may offer more attractive prices or benefit from less expensive funding_
_or pursue lower return requirements than us.”_

**_Gross Collection Levels_**

Intrum Justitia primarily generates revenue from: (a) fees received for credit information and payment
services; (b) fees and commissions received from claims on which it performs debt collection services,
pursuant to contracts that typically contain “no cure no pay” payment terms, which means that Intrum
Justitia is paid only if it is able to successfully collect on a claim; and (c) payments received from
customers linked to claims in its purchased debt portfolios. The ability and willingness of a customer
to pay depends on several factors, such as his/her employment status, the availability of funds and
asset ownership. Intrum Justitia believes that its business benefits from the quality of the data that it
can build about a customer’s circumstances and the analysis it can perform on such data in order to
confirm the customer’s employment status and/or asset ownership, for example, and assess his/her
ability or willingness to pay, and ultimately determine the best collections strategy for individual
customers.

Intrum Justitia has a large and diverse collection of portfolios that have delivered consistent and stable
revenue over time.

_Gross Collection Levels on CMS_

The volume of loans and other overdue receivables outsourced to Intrum Justitia, and consequently
its revenue from debt collection services, is linked to its historic ability to collect on overdue debt and
on its relationships with its debt collection clients, including its ability to demonstrate strong gross
collection levels. Different types of asset classes and different jurisdictions have different collection
profiles and contract types. Intrum Justitia offers flexible pricing arrangements to its debt collection
clients that are tailored for the specific circumstances of the client and the relevant claims to be
outsourced. Intrum Justitia believes that the benefits of its effective claims collection strategy are
evident through its many long-standing client relationships where it is seen as a trusted, important and
strategic business partner, as evidenced by its entry into master servicing agreements pursuant to
which Intrum Justitia provides collection services on the client’s loans and other overdue receivables
that it has not purchased. For more information about Intrum Justitia’s debt collection services, see
“—Key Operating Metrics for CMS.”

_Gross Collection Levels on Purchased Debt_

As of March 31, 2017, Intrum Justitia managed debt with a total collectible value of SEK 377 billion, of
which SEK 223 billion represented purchased portfolios that it owns. Intrum Justitia purchases these
portfolios at significant discounts to total collectible value on purchased debt and typically collects
multiples of the purchase price. After Intrum Justitia purchases a portfolio, it typically manages it
in-house. Revenue generated from claims in its purchased portfolios is impacted by the gross
collection levels that it is able to achieve. As Intrum Justitia keeps the entire amount it collects on
purchased portfolios, it can strategically allocate additional resources and costs to optimize collection
and increase collection levels on a specific portfolio, until it reaches the stage when the resources and
costs required exceed the expected revenue. Intrum Justitia believes that its ability to convert
non-paying claims into paying claims on its purchased portfolios illustrates the degree of accuracy of
its analysis conducted through its data assets and analytical capabilities and the effectiveness of its
scalable, multi-channel collections approach and it further believes that it operates its forecasts with an
appropriate balance between prudent pricing and strong collection performance. From January 1,


-----

2014 to March 31, 2017, Intrum Justitia collected 110% of its cash flow forecasts, adjusted for the
portfolio sales in Western Europe, Northern Europe and Italy in the third quarter of 2016, fourth quarter
of 2016 and first quarter of 2017, respectively. For a description of how Intrum Justitia manages and
tracks the performance of its portfolios, see “—Revaluation of Purchased Debt.”

**_Collection Costs and Operational Efficiency_**

Optimizing customer contact at each stage of the collection life cycle is key to Intrum Justitia’s debt
collection strategy. Much of Intrum Justitia’s debt collection process is standardized and automated,
with the goal of maximizing the total amount collected over the life of the debt through sustainable
payment plans or affordable settlements achieved through an amicable and solution-oriented
collection approach rather than exploiting short-term collection potential. Intrum Justitia benefits when
purchasing a portfolio since any effects resulting from allocating additional resources and cost to
collect is attributed to such portfolio, whereas in debt collection the additional resources and costs
merely produce a marginal increase in commissions and in many cases require its client to accept a
higher commission in order for Intrum Justitia to benefit from the additional revenue generated. Debt
purchasing does not require Intrum Justitia’s client to take this risk, but the client can realize some of
the benefit by receiving an attractive price level.

The table below sets forth Intrum Justitia’s collection costs and its collection cost ratio for the periods
under review.

respectively.

(2)  Cost to collect relative to gross collections for the Financial Services service line.

(3)  Includes intergroup commissions.

(4)  Cost to collect relative to total operating revenue for the CMS service line.

Intrum Justitia’s collection cost ratio has been stable over the last three years despite increasing gross
collections, which is indicative of its operational efficiency and the return on capital it can achieve on
purchased debt. Collection cost ratio is impacted by the varying characteristics of the portfolios Intrum
Justitia purchases in different years and the differences in the timing of portfolio purchases during the
year. Specifically, Intrum Justitia believes that recent trends in its collection cost ratio in the Financial
Services service line have been driven by large uptake in investments in debt portfolios lowering the
average blended age of the portfolios. Costs are typically highest when portfolios are new with the
higher initial collection costs exerting upwards pressure on cost to collect without immediate
accompanying increases in gross collections. In addition, a large portion of recent portfolio purchases
have come from financial institutions which have higher average collectible values, meaning that the
total amount of cash collected per case increases even if the margin is slightly lower.


-----

Operational efficiency is key to Intrum Justitia’s business model and a main advantage of its business
compared to competitors and financial institutions and other customer companies who handle their
debt collection in-house. Intrum Justitia begins the debt collection process by scoring customers,
based on historical data, and anticipates their payment habits, their behaviors and the likelihood that
they will pay. Intrum Justitia thereafter determines which collection method to use for the specific claim,
such as calls, letters, text messages, emails and to some extent personal visits by agents, depending
on various factors, including the geographical market, the claim size, the client Intrum Justitia is acting
on behalf of, the applicable laws and regulations and the individual customer. Intrum Justitia believes
that it is able to optimize collection costs due to its large scale and automation of the debt collection
process and it is able to increase recovery rates through its data assets and analytical capabilities to
optimally tailor debt collection strategies based on past experiences. As a result, Intrum Justitia
believes that it can optimize collection efficiency over the lifetime of the claim.

**_Seasonality_**

The timing of Intrum Justitia’s purchases of portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables is likely
to be uneven during a financial year and from year to year due to fluctuating supply and demand within
the market, with a corresponding impact on leverage and earnings. Intrum Justitia has generally
purchased more portfolios, measured by purchase price, in the fourth quarter (when debt originators
in general, and financial institutions in particular, often seek to sell assets) compared to each of the first
three quarters. For example, it purchased 38% of its portfolios in the fourth quarter of 2016, and 47%
of its portfolios in the fourth quarter of 2015. However, there may be exceptions in certain years, such
as in 2014, when Intrum Justitia purchased only 25% of its portfolios in the fourth quarter. Intrum
Justitia’s interim results for any given quarter may also be impacted by the timing of the closing of a
specific portfolio purchase and/or seasonal factors, such as whether Easter occurs in the first or
second quarter of the year. The seasonality described above impacts Intrum Justitia’s consolidated
income statement as returns generated through debt collections on its purchased portfolios, and
amortization of such portfolios, are recognized in Intrum Justitia’s consolidated income statement as
described in more detail in “—Recognition of Purchased Portfolios, Revenue Recognition, Estimation
_of Cash Flow Forecasts and Revaluation of Purchased Portfolios.”_

Debt collection is also affected by seasonal factors related to customers, including the number of work
days in a given month, the propensity of customers to take holidays at particular times of the year and
annual cycles in disposable income. Collections within portfolios may have high seasonal variances,
while Intrum Justitia’s costs are more evenly spread out over the year, which may result margins in high
variances of margins and profitability between quarters. Intrum Justitia’s margins are generally lower
in the first quarter, whereas its collections will be seasonally higher in the second and fourth quarters
of the year, due to customers’ receipt of tax refunds, holiday bonus payments and other factors.

**_Acquisitions and Geographic Expansion_**

Intrum Justitia has a strong track record of expanding both organically and through acquisitions. It has
been able to successfully integrate new businesses into its existing operations, achieve its strategic
plans and leverage its strong client relationships to acquire assets from some of the largest
telecommunications, utilities, banking and retail companies in Europe. These acquisitions have
allowed Intrum Justitia to enhance its business intelligence capabilities and local collection knowledge
and generate steady streams of revenue.

Intrum Justitia acquired businesses for a total purchase price of over SEK 2.2 billion from January 1,
2014 to March 31, 2017. Its recent acquisitions include:

- In January 2014, Intrum Justitia acquired Profidebt s.r.o., a Czech company with operations that
primarily entail purchasing debt.

- In September 2014, Intrum Justitia acquired Advis A/S, a Danish credit management company
with a strong presence in the telecommunications, media and energy segments.


-----

- In February 2015, Intrum Justitia acquired Credita AG, a Swiss credit management company with
a presence in the public sector and health insurance.

- In February 2015, Intrum Justitia established Avarda AB, a joint venture with TF Bank. Avarda AB
offers payment solutions for e-merchants in the Nordic region. Avarda AB’s solution entails
e-traders being paid directly when a sale is made, while consumers are offered monthly invoices
or accounts with installment payments. Intrum Justitia holds 49% of the shares in Avarda, with an
option to acquire all shares from TF Bank in 2020.

- In June 2015, Intrum Justitia acquired the remaining 30% shareholding in IJCOF SAS, a French
company whose operations involve debt collection from private persons. The acquisition
increased Intrum Justitia’s shareholding from 70% to 100%.

- In September 2015, Intrum Justitia acquired Logicomer Gestáo e Recuperação de Créditos SA,
a Portuguese company primarily engaged in credit management services, but also holding a
purchased debt portfolio.

- In October 2015, Intrum Justitia acquired a 90% shareholding in Cabinet PPN SAS, a French
company providing services in credit management.

- In February 2016, Intrum Justitia acquired Debitoren Services AG, a Swiss company operating a
factoring business.

- In April 2016, Intrum Justitia acquired C&J Credit Services BVBA, a Belgian credit management
company.

- In October 2016, Intrum Justitia acquired Dansk Kreditorservice A/S (DKS), a Danish company
specializing in credit management for SMEs.

- In October 2016, Intrum Justitia acquired Segestión Gabinete Técnico Empresarial SL, a Spanish
company specializing in credit management for SMEs.

- As described in more detail below, in February 2017, Intrum Justitia completed the acquisition of
1st Credit, a UK company with operations in debt purchasing and 137 employees.

_1st Credit Acquisition_

In addition to strengthening our overall position among credit management companies in Europe, the
1st Credit Acquisition represented Intrum Justitia’s re-establishment of operations in the UK market.
Our strategy includes becoming one of the leading credit management players in the UK market, and
we believe this acquisition will create a number of benefits for us. The acquisition further balances our
geographic mix and service line mix. We believe that 1st Credit’s successful adaptation to increased
market regulations in the UK have allowed it to become one of the few companies in the UK to be
regularly invited to bid when banks and financial institutions sell portfolios of overdue receivables.

As 1st Credit was consolidated in Intrum Justitia’s audited consolidated financial statements from
February 14, 2017, the comparability of Intrum Justitia’s results for the three months ended March 31,
2017 with the three months ended March 31, 2016 is limited.

**_Economic Conditions_**

The economic and market conditions in the countries in which Intrum Justitia operates can have
various effects on its operations. For example, adverse economic conditions and increased levels of
unemployment may lead to higher default rates on claims, which in turn may increase the stock of
portfolios available for Intrum Justitia to purchase and positively impact its prospects of purchasing
portfolios with attractive returns. Similarly, negative economic developments may increase the amount
of loans and other overdue receivables possessed by Intrum Justitia’s debt collection clients, thereby
potentially increasing the number of claims outsourced to Intrum Justitia for collection. If adverse
economic conditions materially reduce the ability of customers to enter into transactions and/or repay
their debts, Intrum Justitia’s revenue from credit optimization services, debt collection services and


-----

debt purchasing could decrease. Adverse economic conditions could also reduce debt originators’
propensity to sell overdue receivables at the prices prevailing in the market, thereby decreasing the
volume of portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables available for Intrum Justitia to purchase
and, thereafter, sales by debt originators could increase as they seek to sell portfolios in order to free
up capital, thereby increasing the volume of loans and other overdue receivables available for Intrum
Justitia to purchase. This trend has been evident in the last eight years; the global financial crisis in
2008 and 2009 led to dramatic slowdowns in purchases of portfolios across many of Intrum Justitia’s
markets followed by a significant increase during the periods under review as debt originators sought
to free up capital. Unfavorable economic conditions may also impact Intrum Justitia’s ability to obtain
funding and thereby its ability to purchase portfolios.

Improved economic conditions are likely to lower default rates on loans, which could negatively impact
the growth of the stock of portfolios available for Intrum Justitia to purchase, as well as decrease the
amount of loans and other overdue receivables possessed by Intrum Justitia’s debt collection clients,
which would negatively impact Intrum Justitia debt collection services. Conversely, improved
economic conditions and decreased levels of unemployment: (a) imply that consumers will have
higher income, which implies an increased ability to pay debt due and, therefore, results in a lower cost
to collect incurred by Intrum Justitia; and (b) are likely to drive higher consumption and encourage
clients to offer deferred payment to customers, which is likely to improve demand for Intrum Justitia’s
credit optimization services.

Following the outcome of the United Kingdom public referendum on June 23, 2016 to leave the EU,
the government of the United Kingdom served notice under Article 50 of the Treaty of the European
Union, pursuant to which the United Kingdom has a two-year period to agree the terms for its
withdrawal prior to leaving the EU. This has led to concerns with respect to the overall stability of the
EU and the United Kingdom and the suitability of a single currency to appropriately deal with specific
fiscal management and sovereign debt issues in individual Eurozone countries. If the United Kingdom
and the EU are unable to negotiate acceptable withdrawal terms or if other EU member states pursue
withdrawal, barrier-free access between the United Kingdom and other EU member states or among
the European economic area overall could be diminished or eliminated. The exit of the United Kingdom
or any other member state from the EU, and/or the departure from the euro by one or more Eurozone
countries, or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro entirely, could lead
to a reduction in market confidence and a weakening of European financial institutions. In light of the
exposure that Intrum Justitia has to the EU and the euro through its euro-denominated borrowings,
derivative instruments and cash flows, and to the United Kingdom and the British Pound following the
1st Credit Acquisition, any events adversely affecting the stability of the Eurozone or the United
Kingdom or the euro or the British Pound could have a material adverse impact on its business,
financial condition and results of operations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry and
_Business—The United Kingdom’s exit from the EU may adversely impact our business, results of_
_operations and financial condition.”_

**_Foreign Currency Effects_**

Intrum Justitia currently has local operations in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia,
Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal,
Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Many of Intrum Justitia’s subsidiaries
transact business and report their financial results in currencies other than Swedish kronor, Intrum
Justitia’s consolidated reporting currency. Accordingly, Intrum Justitia’s results of operations are
subject to currency effects, primarily currency translation exposure. For the years ended December 31,
2016, 2015 and 2014, 85%, 85% and 84%, respectively, of Intrum Justitia’s revenue was reported by
entities whose functional currencies were different than the Swedish kronor, primarily the euro and the
Swiss franc, which accounted for 50% and 12%, respectively, of its revenue in 2016, 50% and 13%,
respectively, of its revenue in 2015, and 52% and 12%, respectively, of its revenue in 2014. For the three
months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, 87% and 85%, respectively, of Intrum Justitia’s revenue was
reported by entities whose functional currencies were different than the Swedish kronor, primarily the
euro and the Swiss franc, which accounted for 49% and 12%, respectively, of its revenue in the three


-----

months ended March 31, 2017 and 51% and 13%, respectively, of its revenue in the three months
ended March 31, 2016.

**_Tax Effects_**

The statutory corporate tax rate in Sweden for 2016, 2015 and 2014 was 22%. Intrum Justitia’s effective
tax rate in 2016 and 2015 was 18.9% and 19.6%, respectively, primarily due to variations in the mix of
taxable income among the Intrum Justitia subsidiaries in jurisdictions with different tax rates. The
expected effective tax rate for the Company following the Merger has not yet been assessed. It should,
however, be noted that transaction costs for acquiring new subsidiaries are in general not
tax-deductible in Sweden. For additional information regarding income tax expense, see Note 8 to the
audited consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for the year ended December 31, 2016 included
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Recent Developments_**

In April 2017, Intrum Justitia acquired Top Factoring SRL, one of the leading companies for purchased
debt in Romania. The purchase price was €25.7 million, attributable mainly to a diversified portfolio of
overdue receivables.

In April 2017, Intrum Justitia acquired the remaining 42% shareholding in IJCOF Corporate SAS, a
French company whose operations involve collection from corporations.

**Recognition of Purchased Portfolios, Revenue Recognition, Estimation of Cash Flow Forecasts**
**and Revaluation of Purchased Portfolios**

The following sections describe how the IFRS accounting under the amortized cost methodology
recognizes the carrying value of purchased debt in Intrum Justitia’s consolidated statement of financial
position, and the returns generated through debt collections on such portfolios in its consolidated
income statement. These IFRS measures are derived from a number of other measures that are not
defined in IFRS and which involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity, including EIR and ERC,
and these are areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the Issuer’s Financial
Statements.

**_Recognition of Purchased Portfolios_**

Purchased debt consists of portfolios of delinquent consumer debt purchased at prices significantly
below the nominal receivable. They are recognized according to the rules for loans and receivables in
IAS 39 (or, for any annual periods beginning on or after January 2018, according to IFRS 9), i.e., at
amortized cost according to the effective interest model.

Income from purchased debt is recognized in the income statement as the collected amount less
amortization. The collection is often performed by the same personnel who handle collections and
debt surveillance on behalf of external clients within the CMS service line. The cost of collection is
debited internally at market price and expensed in the income statement for the Financial Services
service line as a cost of services sold.

Reporting follows the effective interest method, where the carrying value of each portfolio corresponds
to the present value of all projected future cash flows discounted by an initial EIR determined on the
date the portfolio was acquired, based on the relation between purchase price cost and the projected
future cash flows on the acquisition date. Changes in the carrying value of purchased debt are
recognized as amortization for the period and included in the income statement on the revenue line.
Compensation received from debt originators due to rejected cases and price adjustments made to
purchased portfolios are recorded as an adjustment to the acquisition cost.

In connection with the purchase of each portfolio of receivables, a projection for a period of 180
months is made of the portfolio’s cash flows. Cash flows include the loan amount, reminder fees,
collection fees and late interest that, based on a probability assessment, are expected to be received
from debtors, less forecast collection costs. With this forecast and the purchase price (including


-----

transaction costs) as a basis, each portfolio is assigned an initial effective interest rate that is then used
to discount cash flows through the life of the portfolio. Cash flow actual performance is compared
against projections and monitored on a monthly basis for all portfolios, although adjustments to
projections are only made after the first year. Projections are updated based on, among other things,
achieved collection results, agreements reached with debtors on installment plans and
macroeconomic information. Cash flow projections are made at the portfolio level, since each portfolio
of receivables consists of a small number of homogeneous amounts. On the basis of the updated cash
flow projections and initial effective interest rate, a new carrying value for the portfolio is calculated in
the closing accounts.

Intrum Justitia applies internal application rules, which means that the initial EIR can be adjusted in
certain cases without a change in the carrying value of the portfolio for minor projection adjustments
within a predetermined interval. Changes over time in the book value can be divided into a time and
interest rate component (amortizations) and a component related to changes in estimates of future
cash flows (revaluations).

The effects of changes in cash flow forecasts are referred to as revaluations and treated symmetrically,
i.e., both increases and decreases in forecast flows affect the portfolios’ book value and, as a result,
earnings. However, the portfolios are never recognized at higher than cost. Although selling portfolios
of purchased debt is not included in Intrum Justitia’s business model, when such sales do occur as an
exception, the resulting sales price received for the portfolio is reported in the same way as if it had
been collected from the debtors. The entire remaining carrying values of the portfolios are then
recognized as amortization.

From time to time, Intrum Justitia also purchases portfolios on a forward flow basis. In a forward flow
agreement, Intrum Justitia agrees to buy claims at a pre-defined price or price range for a given volume
and quality from a client on an ongoing basis. Claims under forward flow agreements can be delivered
on weekly, monthly or quarterly basis and the EIR of these claims is calculated per batch delivered.
Each delivery under a forward flow agreement is treated as an individual portfolio purchase, using its
own purchase cost and its own EIR calculation.

**_Recognition of Revenue from Purchased Portfolios_**

Revenue on a purchase debt portfolio is calculated as the total of the actual achieved gross collected
amounts of the portfolio during each month, less purchased debt amortization and adjusted for
positive or negative purchased debt revaluations. As a result of this methodology, revenue for a
portfolio will correspond closely to its carrying value multiplied by the EIR that would have been
determined if the calculation had been based on gross collections, adjusted for over- or
under-performance and for revaluations.

**_Estimation of Cash Flow Forecasts from Purchased Debt_**

The estimation of cash flow forecasts (i.e., ERC) is a key uncertainty within Intrum Justitia’s policies on
revenue recognition of purchased debt portfolios. Intrum Justitia establishes estimates of cash flows
that determine the EIR for each purchased portfolio. The estimates are based on Intrum Justitia’s
collection history with respect to portfolios comprising similar attributes and characteristics, such as
date of purchase, debt originator, type of receivable, customer payment histories, customer location,
and the time since the original charge-off, as well as on its experience and the existing schedule of
repayment plans on the particular portfolio for which it is determining EIR.

**_Revaluation of Purchased Debt_**

In anticipation of the end of each reporting period, currently every quarter, Intrum Justitia evaluates
portfolio forecasts to assess whether there is objective evidence that a portfolio should be subject to
revaluation. Indications of positive or negative revaluation mainly include any significant deviation
against the currently active forecast for the portfolio, but also takes into account an assessment of
groups of customers experiencing financial difficulty, default of interest or principal payments, the
probability that customers will enter into bankruptcy, debt restructuring or other financial
reorganization, and observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated
future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults.
Conversely, there can also be a positive revaluation in the event that a portfolio displays objective
evidence of expected cash flows above the currently active forecast.

In practice, a number of purchased debt portfolios are identified each quarter for potential revaluation.
The portfolios that are selected for this are only those portfolios that Intrum Justitia has owned for at
least 12 months, where net collections in the past 12 months (or since the latest revaluation within the
past 12 months) have deviated more than 10% positively or negatively against the active forecast,
where net collections in the past 12 months exceeded €10,000, and where the current carrying value
exceeds €10,000. Portfolios that do not fulfill all four of these criteria are not considered for revaluation,
unless a special request is made by country or regional management. Portfolios which fulfill all four
criteria are however considered as candidates for a potential revaluation. They are analyzed among
Intrum Justitia staff at group and local level in the collecting entities to determine if the deviation in the
past indicates a need to revise the forecast for the future. New forecasts may be generated using
statistical methods, and agreed upon. All changes in active collection forecasts are then signed off and
agreed by Intrum Justitia’s revaluation committee. A change in the collection forecast may be coupled
with an adjustment of the applied EIR for portfolios within a certain range, whereby the carrying value
remains unchanged for portfolios still performing within predefined limits.

**Key Operating Metrics for Purchased Debt**

During the periods under review, Intrum Justitia has experienced significant growth in its asset base
and cash flow generation, which we believe is the result of: (i) the growing volume of portfolios of loans
and other overdue receivables Intrum Justitia has been able to purchase; (ii) its pricing discipline; (iii)
the efficiency and sophistication of its debt collection operations; and (iv) the successful
implementation of its strategy regarding the selection, acquisition and integration of certain credit
management businesses.

(1)  Vintage corresponds to the year of acquisition of a purchased portfolio of loans and other overdue receivables by Intrum
Justitia. Vintages of portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables acquired as part of business acquisitions correspond
to the year of acquisition of such business by Intrum Justitia.

ERC growth over time is primarily due to portfolio purchases; as Intrum Justitia collects on existing
portfolios, the ERC on these portfolios will decline. During the periods under review, there have not
been any material changes in forecast expectations at the overall portfolio level. Intrum Justitia’s ERC
on purchased portfolios grew from SEK 12,824 million as of December 31, 2014 to SEK 21,681 million
as of March 31, 2017. The table below sets forth ERC on purchased portfolios as of the periods
indicated.

**Description of Principal Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Line Items**

The following is a discussion of Intrum Justitia’s key consolidated statement of financial position line
items.

**_Purchased Debt_**

Purchased debt consists mainly of portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables purchased at
prices significantly below the nominal total collectible value on purchased debt and which are
recognized at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The carrying value of each portfolio
corresponds to the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted by an EIR. The initial EIR
is based on the relation between purchase cost and the projected future cash flows on the date of
purchase. See “—Key Factors Affecting Intrum Justitia’s Results of Operations—Recognition of
_Purchased Portfolios, Revenue Recognition, Estimation of Cash Flow Forecasts and Revaluation of_
_Purchased Portfolios.”_

**Description of Key Line Items in the Principal Income Statement**

The following is a discussion of Intrum Justitia’s key income statement line items.

**_Net Revenue_**

Consolidated net revenues include external CMS revenues (variable collection commissions, fixed
collection fees, debtor fees, guarantee commissions, subscription income, etc.), income from
purchased debt operations (collected amounts less amortization and revaluations) and other revenues
from Financial Services (fees and net interest from financing services).

**_Cost of Sales_**

Cost of sales are cost of services sold, including production expenses (all costs directly incurred in
order to establish the reported net revenue), sales expense associated with existing clients (costs
associated with the maintenance of existing clients and adding value to the relationship, such as
complaints management), and related IT expenses (running and maintenance costs for IT
infrastructure). Cost of sales include costs for personnel, postage, purchase of external information,
legal and bailiff costs, bank charges for client funds bank accounts, apportioned rent and office costs,
as well as depreciation on related fixed assets.

**_Sales and Marketing Expenses_**

Sales and marketing expenses include sales expense associated with new clients (costs associated
with selling activities, preparation of customer contracts, writing of order specifications, sales
promotion, administration of order filling and billing), marketing expenses (advertising, promotion,
marketing staff costs, market analyses, planning of market strategy, sponsoring), and bad debt losses
on accounts receivable for invoicing to clients. Examples of costs are staff costs, consultancies,
apportioned rent and office costs, and depreciation on related fixed assets.


-----

**_Administrative Expenses_**

Administrative expenses include group, regional and local level costs for finance and human resource
departments as well as board of directors and group and local management. Examples of costs are
staff costs, consultancies, audit fees, costs for IT support, apportioned rent and office costs, and
depreciation on fixed assets.

**_Goodwill Impairment_**

Refers to any write-down of goodwill following an impairment test performed in accordance with IAS 36
Impairment of Assets. For the purpose of impairment testing of goodwill, Intrum Justitia treats each of
its three geographical regions (Northern Europe, Central Europe and Western Europe) as a
cash-generating unit. In the year 2014, the subsidiary Buckaroo BV was considered as a
cash-generating unit of its own, separate from the three geographical regions, and goodwill attributed
to Buckaroo BV was written down as, according to impairment tests performed in preparation for the
year-end, its goodwill was impaired.

**_Reversal of Liability for Additional Purchase Consideration_**

Refers to any change in the fair value of the liability for a contingent consideration related to a business
combination that should be recognized in profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 2 page 58.

**_Participations in Earnings of Associated Companies and Joint Ventures_**

Refers to Intrum Justitia’s share of profit or loss in associates and joint ventures recognized in
accordance with IAS 28. Intrum Justitia currently has one joint venture company, Avarda AB.

**_Net Financial Items_**

Consists of the net of Intrum Justitia’s interest income, interest expenses, exchange rate differences,
amortization and impairment of capitalized borrowing costs, and other financial expenses. Other
financial expenses are primarily attributable to bank fees and borrowing costs allocated to the period.

**_Taxes_**

Income taxes consist of current and deferred tax. Current tax is tax that is to be paid or received during
the period in question applying the tax rates applicable on the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is
calculated according to the balance sheet method based on temporary differences between the
carrying value of assets and liabilities and their value for tax purposes.

_Net Revenue_

Intrum Justitia’s net revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was SEK 1,609 million, which
represents a 14% increase compared to its net revenues of SEK 1,408 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2016. Excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, Intrum Justitia’s net
revenue for the first three months of 2017 increased by 13% compared to the first three months of
2016. Of the 13% increase in net revenue, 3% was attributable to acquisitions effects and 10% was due
to organic growth. The increase in organic growth was due to increased net revenues from the
Financial Services service line, where net revenues, excluding foreign currency effects, rose by 20%.
The growth in Financial Services was mainly due to increased investments in debt portfolios and
growth in book value for purchased debt. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, investments in
purchased debt amounted to SEK 2,377 million compared to SEK 738 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2016, which contributed to an increase in book value for purchased debt of 43% over
the period. The increase in purchased debt was primarily attributable to the acquisition of 1st Credit in
the UK, which accounted for SEK 1,334 million of the investments in purchased debt for the three
months ended March 31, 2017. On a geographic basis, net revenue growth increased by 1% for the
Northern Europe region, 30% for the Central Europe region and 13% for the Western Europe region in
the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016,
excluding foreign currency effect and impact from revaluations of purchased debt.

The table below sets forth, for each of the periods indicated, Intrum Justitia’s operating net revenue by
service line, both in SEK and as a percentage of consolidated net revenue, and the percentage
increase or decrease in operating net revenue by service line from period to period. For a discussion
on Intrum Justitia’s service line reporting, see “—Results of Operations on a Service Line Basis.”

_Net revenue_

Intrum Justitia’s net revenue increased by SEK 460 million, or 8%, from SEK 5,628 million in the year
ended December 31, 2015 to SEK 6,088 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the
effect of foreign currency translation, Intrum Justitia’s net revenue increased by 8% in the year ended
December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Of the 8% increase, 1% came
from acquisitions effects and 6% was organic growth. The increase in organic growth was due to
increased net revenues from the Financial Services service line, where net revenues, excluding foreign
currency effects, rose by 19%. The growth in Financial Services was, in turn, mainly due to increased
investments and growth in book value for purchased debt. For the year ended December 31, 2016,
investments in purchased debt amounted to SEK 3,100 million compared to SEK 2,428 million in the
year ended December 31, 2015, which contributed to an increase in book value for purchased
receivables of 24% over the period. The increase in purchased debt was primarily attributable to the
€58 million investment made by Intrum Justitia in a secured portfolio in Hungary. On a geographic
basis, net revenue growth increased by 9% for the Northern Europe region, 7% for the Central Europe
region and 6% for the Western Europe region in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the
year ended December 31, 2015, adjusted to give effect to limited foreign currency effect.

The table below sets forth, for each of the periods indicated, Intrum Justitia’s operating net revenue by
service line, both in SEK and as a percentage of consolidated net revenue, and the percentage
increase or decrease in operating net revenue by service line from period to period. For a discussion

effect of foreign currency translation, cost of sales increased by 3% in the year ended December 31,
2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was mainly driven by a greater

year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was


-----

in the year ended December 31, 2015 to negative SEK 168 million in the year ended December 31,
2016. Net interest expense increased by SEK 9 million mainly due to higher borrowing required to fund
portfolio acquisitions. Other financial items decreased by SEK 11 million as the year ended December
31, 2015 included an item of SEK 13 million for the expensing of previously capitalized borrowing costs
associated with the signing of a new loan facility. Exchange rate differences had an impact of negative

ended December 31, 2015 to SEK 342 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. The tax expense
increased mainly due to the increased profit before tax, whereas the tax expense as a percentage of

for the year ended December 31, 2015.

_Net revenue_

Intrum Justitia’s net revenue increased by SEK 444 million, or 9%, from SEK 5,184 million in the year
ended December 31, 2014 to SEK 5,628 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding the
effect of foreign currency translation, Intrum Justitia’s net revenue increased by 5% in the year ended
December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Of the 5% increase, 2% came
from acquisitions effects and 3% was due to organic growth. The increase in organic growth was due
to increased net revenues in the Financial Services service line, where net revenues, excluding foreign
currency effects, rose by 7%. The growth in Financial Services was, in turn, mainly due to increased
investments and growth in book value for purchased debt. During the year ended December 31, 2015,
investments in purchased debt amounted to SEK 2,428 million compared to SEK 1,937 million in the
year ended December 31 2014, which contributed to an increase in book value for purchased
receivables of 13% by December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014. On a geographic basis,
net revenue growth increased by 1% for the Northern Europe region, 19% for the Central Europe
region and 13% for the Western Europe region in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the
year ended December 31, 2015. The growth in Central Europe and Western Europe was primarily due
to greater investments in portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables, as well as the acquisition
of several credit management companies in Western Europe.

effect of foreign currency translation cost of sales increased by 1% in the year ended December 31,
2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was mainly driven by a greater
volume of demand for Intrum Justitia’s CMS service line, primarily driven by servicing requirements for
its own debt, which has a direct corresponding impact on collection-related costs, such as expensed
legal outlays and sending letters. As a percentage of net revenue, cost of sales decreased from 57%
in the year ended December 31, 2014 to 55% in the year ended December 31, 2015.

million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to SEK 252 million in the year ended December 31, 2016.
Excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, sales and marketing expense decreased by 7% in
the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. As a
percentage of net revenue, sales and marketing expenses decreased from 5% in the year ended
December 31, 2014 to 4% in the year ended December 31 2015. The decrease was mainly driven by
lower costs for bad debts.


-----

Intrum Justitia’s administrative expenses increased by SEK 76 million, or 13%, from SEK 585 million in
the year ended December 31, 2014 to SEK 661 million in the year ended December 31, 2015.
Excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, administrative expenses decreased by 10% in the
year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. As a percentage
of net revenue, administrative expenses increased from 11% in the year ended December 31, 2014 to
12% in the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was mainly due to costs associated with the
termination of certain senior executives during 2015.

_Goodwill Impairment_

Intrum Justitia’s goodwill impairment decreased from SEK 111 million in the year ended December 31,
2014 to SEK 0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. The year ended December 31 2014

decreased from SEK 164 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to SEK 0 million in the year
ended December 31, 2015. The year ended December 31 2014 included a reversal of liability for
additional purchase consideration for shares in the same Dutch subsidiary which carried out a goodwill
impairment charge during this year.

_Participations in Future Earnings of Associated Companies and Joint Ventures_

Intrum Justitia’s participations in future earnings of associated companies and joint ventures
decreased by SEK 7 million, from positive SEK 3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to
negative SEK 4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was mainly due to losses
in Avarda AB.

_Net Financial Items_

Intrum Justitia’s net financial items decreased by SEK 16 million, or 9%, from SEK 183 million in the
year ended December 31, 2014 to SEK 167 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Net interest
expense decreased by SEK 31 million mainly due to lower market interest rates offsetting the impact
of higher borrowing incurred to fund investments in debt portfolios. Other financial items increased by
SEK 9 million as the year ended December 31, 2015 included an item of SEK 13 million for the
expensing of previously capitalized borrowing costs associated with the signing of a new loan facility.
Exchange rate differences had an impact of negative SEK 5 million on net financial items for the year
ended December 31, 2015, compared to positive SEK 1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.

ended December 31, 2014 to SEK 285 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. The tax expense
increased due to the increased profit before tax and due to an increased tax expense as a percentage
of profit before tax, from 20% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 17% for the year
ended December 31, 2014. The lower tax expense as a percentage of profit before tax in 2014 was
mainly due to certain non-recurring items.

_Net Earnings for the Period_

Intrum Justitia recognized a net earning of SEK 1,172 million in the year ended December 31, 2015
and a net earning of SEK 1,041 million in the year ended December 31, 2014.

SEK 1,024 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 to SEK 1,160 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2017. The increase was mainly driven by higher volumes from servicing of Intrum

DKS and Segestión (both acquired in October 2016). Excluding the effect of foreign currency
translation, CMS net revenue from external customers increased by SEK 112 million, or 11%, for the


-----

three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. The
increase in CMS net revenue from external customers was due to the acquisitions mentioned above.

Financial Services net revenue increased by SEK 129 million, or 20%, for the three months ended
March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase was driven by
higher investments in purchased debt, which contributed to an increase in purchased debt book value
by 43% as of March 31, 2017 compared to March 31, 2016.

_Service Line Earnings_

An analysis of Intrum Justitia’s operating earnings by service line is set forth below:

from SEK 241 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 to SEK 273 million for the three

earnings increased by SEK 26 million, or 11%, for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared

net revenue growth, whereas operating margins remained unchanged.

by SEK 54 million, or 15%, from SEK 364 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 to SEK

translation, Financial Services operating earnings increased by SEK 48 million, or 13%, for the three
months ended March 31, 2017 compared to three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase was
driven by increased net revenues from a higher purchased debt book value whereas the higher prices
resulted in a lower return on investment, which had a negative impact on service line operating
earnings margin, decreasing from 57% in the three months ended March 31, 2016 to 53% for the three
months ended March 31, 2016.

SEK 4,194 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to SEK 4,335 million in the year ended
December 31, 2016. The increase was mainly driven by higher volumes from servicing of Intrum
Justitia’s own purchased debt portfolios as well as increased net revenues from acquisitions,
particularly Logicomer (acquired in September 2015), DKS and Segestión (both acquired in October
2016). Excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, CMS net revenue increased by SEK
119 million, or 3%, in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31,

increased by SEK 78 million, or 7%, in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2015. The increase in service line earnings was mainly driven by net revenue growth at
low marginal cost increases, due to scale benefits, ongoing operational efficiencies as a consequence

servicing its debt portfolios. The increase was also due to positive earnings impact from acquired units.

_Financial Services: The operating earnings of Intrum Justitia’s Financial Services service line increased_
by SEK 290 million, or 22%, from SEK 1,345 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to SEK 1,635

December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was driven by
increased operating net revenues from a higher purchased debt book value with a stable return on
investment. In addition, service line earnings for the year ended December 31, 2016 included a positive
effect of SEK 84 million relating to sales of purchased debt portfolios.

(1)  Inter-service line net revenue relates to payment on arm’s-length terms for work carried out with CMS regarding handling
and collection of Intrum Justitia’s purchased debt. Payment is made in the form of a commission that is recognized as a
cost within Financial Services.

(2)  Common costs are costs that are not attributed to either of the service lines Credit Management Services or Financial
Services, mainly consisting of shared expenses for sales, marketing and administration.

_Service Line Net Revenue_

An analysis of Intrum Justitia’s net revenue by service line is set forth below:

_CMS: The net revenue of Intrum Justitia’s CMS service line increased by SEK 350 million, or 9%, from_
SEK 3,844 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to SEK 4,194 million in the year ended
December 31, 2015. The increase was mainly driven by increased volume from Intrum Justitia’s own
purchased debt portfolio as well as acquired units. Excluding the effect of foreign currency translation,
CMS net revenue from external customers increased by SEK 199 million, or 5%, in the year ended
December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increased net revenue from


-----

external customers was primarily driven by the acquisitions of credit management companies,
including Advis A/S in October 2014, Credita AG in February 2015, Logicomer in September 2015 and
the acquisition of 90% of the shares in Cabinet PPN SAS in October 2015.

_Financial Services: The net revenue of Intrum Justitia’s Financial Services service line increased by_
SEK 250 million, or 12%, from SEK 2,173 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to SEK 2,423
million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding the effect of foreign currency translation,
Financial Services net revenue from external customers increased by SEK 147 million, or 7%, in the
year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was
driven by higher investments in purchased debt which contributed to an increase in purchased debt
book value by 13% as of December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014.

_Service Line Earnings_

An analysis of Intrum Justitia’s operating earnings by service line is set forth below:

_CMS: The operating earnings of Intrum Justitia’s CMS service line increased by SEK 137 million, or_
15%, from SEK 912 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to SEK 1,049 million in the year
ended December 31, 2015. Excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, CMS operating
earnings increased by SEK 100 million, or 11%, in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to
the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in service line earnings was mainly driven by net
revenue growth at low marginal cost increases, due to scale benefits, ongoing operational efficiencies
as a consequence of improved use of analytics and the leverage of Intrum Justitia’s existing servicing
capabilities when servicing its debt portfolios. The increase was also due to positive earnings impact
from acquired units, which caused the service line margin to increase by 1% in 2015 compared to
2014.

_Financial Services: The operating earnings of Intrum Justitia’s Financial Services service line increased_
by SEK 186 million, or 16%, from SEK 1,159 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to
SEK 1,345 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding the effect of foreign currency
translation, Financial Services operating earnings increased by SEK 134 million, or 12%, in the year
ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was driven
by increased net revenues from a higher purchased debt book value with a stable return on
investment.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Historically, Intrum Justitia’s liquidity requirements primarily arose as a result of servicing debt, tax and
funding its purchased portfolios, capital expenditure and working capital. Intrum Justitia’s primary
source of liquidity during the periods under review has been its net cash generation from operations
and borrowings from banks, including the Intrum Justitia Existing Revolving Credit Facility, and capital
markets, including both the Intrum Justitia Existing MTNs and the Intrum Justitia Existing Commercial
Paper Program.

Intrum Justitia’s collections have historically generated a stable and predictable cash flow throughout
the year which is in contrast to the debt purchasing activities, which vary between quarters. This is
driven by the supply, which Intrum Justitia does not control, of portfolios in the market and Intrum
Justitia’s willingness to invest in the particular asset at the prevailing price. This can lead to volatility in
Intrum Justitia’s free cash flow on a quarter by quarter basis. For example, in 2016 Intrum Justitia’s net
cash flow from investing activities varied between SEK 1.4 billion and SEK 0.5 billion for the quarters.

Following the completion of the Merger, Intrum Justitia’s primary source of liquidity will be its net cash
generation from operations and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Intrum
Justitia’s operating cash flow generation depends on its future operating performance, which in turn
is, to some extent, dependent on, amongst other things, the general economic environment,
competitive market and regulatory environment in which it operates, as well as other factors discussed
in the section “Risk Factors.”

_Net cash generated from operating activities_

Intrum Justitia’s net cash generated from operating activities decreased by SEK 23 million, from
SEK 730 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016 to SEK 707 million in the three months
ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in net cash generated from operating activities was due to higher
tax payments. Net cash from operating earnings, adjusted for revaluations and amortization developed
positively with an increase of SEK 186 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared
to the three months ended March 31, 2016, which was primarily driven by growth in Adjusted EBITDA
from collection operations.

Intrum Justitia’s net cash generated from operating activities increased by SEK 469 million from
SEK 2,905 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to SEK 3,374 million in the year ended
December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to improved operating earnings excluding
depreciation and amortization as well as lower cash outflow in interest payments, partially offset by a
reduction in cash flow from working capital.

Intrum Justitia’s net cash generated from operating activities increased by SEK 233 million from
SEK 2,672 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to SEK 2,905 million in the year ended
December 31, 2015. This increase was mainly due to improved operating earnings excluding
depreciation and amortization as well as improved cash flow from working capital, partially offset by
increased negative cash flow from taxes paid.

_Net cash used in investing activities_

Intrum Justitia’s net cash used in investing activities increased by SEK 1,014 million from
SEK 1,142 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 to SEK 2,156 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2017. The increase was mainly due to increased disbursements for investments in
purchased debt, which amounted to SEK 2,072 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017,
compared to SEK 1,041 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, which increase was
primarily attributable to the 1st Credit Acquisition.


-----

Intrum Justitia’s net cash used in investing activities increased by SEK 1,266 million from
SEK 2,497 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to SEK 3,763 million in the year ended
December 31, 2016. The increase was mainly due to increased disbursements for investments in
purchased debt, which amounted to SEK 3,374 million for the year ended December 31, 2016,
compared to SEK 2,186 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Intrum Justitia’s net cash used in investing activities increased by SEK 247 million from SEK 2,250
million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to SEK 2,497 million in the year ended December 31,
2015. The increase was primarily due to increased disbursements for investments in purchased debt,
which amounted to SEK 2,186 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to SEK 1,950
million for the year ended December 31, 2014.

_Net cash from/(used in) financing activities_

Intrum Justitia’s net cash from financing activities increased by SEK 1,029 million from SEK 341 million
in the three months ended March 31, 2016 to SEK 1,370 million in the three months ended March 31,
2017. The increase in net cash from financing activities was primarily attributable to increased
borrowing in connection with the 1st Credit Acquisition. Also, during the quarter, Intrum Justitia
renegotiated the Intrum Justitia Existing Revolving Credit Facility to enhance financial flexibility.

Intrum Justitia’s net cash from financing activities increased by SEK 902 million from net cash used in
financing activities of negative SEK 399 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to net cash from
financing activities of positive SEK 503 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in
net cash from financing activities was primarily related to increased borrowing related to a new loan
from Svensk Exportkredit, netted against higher amortization of existing loans, as well as that no share
buybacks were carried out in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to share buybacks of
SEK 400 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.

Intrum Justitia’s net cash used in financing activities decreased by SEK 102 million from negative
SEK 501 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to negative SEK 399 million in the year ended
December 31, 2015. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to reduced
amortization of existing loans and lower share buybacks of SEK 400 million for the year ended
December 31, 2015, compared to share buybacks of SEK 968 million for the year ended December
31, 2014, netted against reduced borrowing.

**_Capital Expenditure_**

Intrum Justitia’s capital expenditure consists mainly of: IT, both software and capitalized development
expenses (treated as intangible fixed assets) and hardware (treated as tangible fixed assets) plus
investments in equipment and fixtures and fittings. Intrum Justitia’s capital expenditure amounted to
SEK 36 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017, unchanged compared to the capital
expenditure for the three months ended March 31, 2016.

Intrum Justitia’s capital expenditure increased by SEK 9 million, from SEK 135 million in the year ended
December 31, 2015 to SEK 144 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to
investment in IT software and development. Intrum Justitia’s capital expenditure decreased by
SEK 7 million, from SEK 142 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to SEK 135 million in the
year ended December 31, 2015, due primarily to lower levels of investment in office equipment and
fixtures.

Intrum Justitia uses operating assets through operating lease agreements, primarily leases for its
premises in the countries in which it operates. The minimum remaining payments under such leases
within the year ending December 31, 2017 total SEK 134 million, with SEK 277 million due on these
leases in the following four years (January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2021) and SEK 110 million
due on these leases thereafter. No single lease is of material significance to Intrum Justitia in terms of
amount.

**_Other Financial Obligations: Pension Obligations_**

For a description of certain pension plans and obligations, see Note 21 to Intrum Justitia’s audited
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 included elsewhere
in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Off Balance Sheet Arrangements_**

Intrum Justitia reports pledged assets consisting of deposits (mainly with landlords) and restricted
bank balances that can be claimed by clients, suppliers or authorities in the event that Intrum Justitia
were not to meet its contractual obligations, and contingent liabilities consisting of payment
guarantees. Intrum Justitia offers payment guarantee services whereby clients, against payment,
obtain a guarantee from Intrum Justitia regarding the clients’ receivables from their customers. This
entails a risk being incurred that Intrum Justitia must compensate the customer for the guaranteed
amount in the event that the invoices are not paid on time. In those cases where the guarantee comes
into play, Intrum Justitia assumes the client’s claim against its customer and takes over the continued
handling of the case within the Financial Services service line. For details, see Note 25 to Intrum
Justitia’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016
included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Financial Risk Management**

See Note 34 to Intrum Justitia’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2016 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum for additional information on
Intrum Justitia’s exposure to market risk and the risk of loss that may result from the potential change
in exchange rates, interest levels, refinancing and credit risks.


-----

**_Market Risk_**

_Market and Regulatory Environment_

The main market risk is related to, but not limited to, general macroeconomic conditions and local rules
and statutory regulations in each of the geographical markets in which Intrum Justitia operates and
which, in turn, affect the customers’ ability to pay and Intrum Justitia’s clients’ ability and willingness
to sell portfolios of loans and receivables and potential commission from third party collection. See
“Risk Factors” for a discussion of these and other factors.

_Foreign Exchange Risk_

Intrum Justitia operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various
currency exposures, primarily with respect to the Euro and Swiss Franc compared to Intrum Justitia’s
reporting currency Swedish kronor. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions,
recognized assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations. Intrum Justitia’s strategy is
to manage and limit currency risk. Exchange rate risk can be divided into transaction exposure and
translation exposure. Intrum Justitia has investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are
exposed to foreign currency translation risk. Currency exposure arising from the net assets of Intrum
Justitia’s foreign operations is, among other means, managed through borrowings denominated in
relevant foreign currencies.

_Transaction Exposure: In each country, revenue and operating expenses are mainly denominated in_
local currencies, and thus currency fluctuations have only a limited impact on Intrum Justitia’s
operating earnings in local currency. National operations rarely have receivables and liabilities in
foreign currency. Revenue and expenses in national currency are thus hedged in a natural way, which
limits transaction exposure. The currency exposure that arises within the operating activities is limited
to the extent it pertains to international collection operations. The subsidiaries’ projected cash flow
exposure is not hedged at present. At Intrum Justitia’s group level financing, both the debt collection
and the debt purchasing operations are funded in relevant currencies reflecting the underlying
exposures.

_Translation Exposure: Intrum Justitia operates in 21 countries. The results and financial position of its_
subsidiaries is reported in the relevant foreign currencies and later translated into SEK for inclusion in
the company’s consolidated financial statements. 85%, 85% and 84% of Intrum Justitia’s revenue was
generated in foreign currency for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Consequently,
fluctuations in SEK exchange rates against these currencies affect Intrum Justitia’s net revenue and
earnings, as well as equity and other items in its financial statements. Intrum Justitia’s net revenue is
distributed by currency as follows:

If these currencies would have weakened/strengthened by 10% on average against the SEK, with all
other variable held constant, net revenue would have increased/decreased by approximately
SEK 520 million.

Liquidity risk is the risk that Intrum Justitia incurs higher-than-expected costs to ensure its ability to fulfill
its short and long-term payment obligations to external parties. The objective has historically been
fulfilled via the Intrum Justitia Existing Revolving Credit Facility, debt capital market transactions and
bilateral loan agreements and we expect to rely on the Revolving Credit Facility for these purposes in
the future.

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

Interest rate risk is the risk of negative effects on interest income and expenses due to movements in
interest rates. For Intrum Justitia interest rate risks relate primarily to the cost of interest-bearing debt,
the debt rate is tied to the market rate and generally have a short duration. Intrum Justitia’s strong cash
flow generating business allows Intrum Justitia to repay its debt or invest in operations, and hence
Intrum Justitia can manage debt size and consequently its total interest cost.

**_Credit risk_**

Credit risk is the risk that Intrum Justitia’s counterparties are unable to fulfill their obligations to Intrum
Justitia. Each local entity is responsible for managing and analyzing the credit risk for each of their new
clients before standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. Credit risk arises from
assets, such as cash and cash equivalents, guarantees and derivative _financial instruments and_
deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as outstanding receivables, purchased debt and
outlays on behalf of clients. For financial assets owned by us, very limited collateral or other credit
reinforcements have been received. Therefore, the maximum credit exposure for each class of financial
assets corresponds to the carrying amount. There is also a limited risk of loss linked to Intrum Justitia’s
debt collection services, however, this risk is primarily carried by Intrum Justitia’s clients.

To minimize the risks related to purchase of portfolios, caution is exercised in purchase decisions.
Purchases are usually made from clients with whom Intrum Justitia has maintained long-term
relationships and therefore has a thorough understanding of the receivables in question. Purchased
debt is usually purchased at prices significantly below the nominal value of the receivables, and are
not collateralized. Intrum Justitia retains the entire amount it collects, including interest and fees. For
more information on Intrum Justitia’s purchased debt, see “—Purchased Debt.”

_“Risk Factors.”_

**Key Factors Affecting Lindorff’s Results of Operations**

Lindorff’s business and results of operations, as well as the key operating metrics discussed below,
have been, and are expected to continue to be, affected by certain key factors including, in particular,
level of debt available for purchase and for third party collection, purchases of debt portfolios at the
right price, competition and pricing, gross collection levels, collection costs and operational efficiency,
cost saving measures, seasonality, acquisitions and geographic expansion, economic conditions,
foreign currency effects and tax effects. Each of these factors is discussed in more detail below.

**_Level of Debt Available for Purchase and for Third Party Collection_**

Lindorff’s results of operations are linked to the overall level of loans and other overdue receivables
available for purchase and for third-party collection in the markets and industry sectors in which it
operates. According to the Company Market Study, the level of sale and outsourcing of loans and other
overdue receivables has increased in these markets, particularly in relation to NPLs originated by
financial institutions, and we believe that this development will continue. This market growth
opportunity is largely driven by three factors: a large build-up of NPLs by financial institutions, an
increased propensity to sell NPLs as regulation has put pressure on financial institutions to delever and
an increase in the number of financial institutions selling debt and outsourcing collection services as
financial institutions have refocused their businesses by exiting non-core operations, such as in-house
debt collection. During the periods under review, Lindorff benefitted from these industry trends and
was able to expand its operations and increase its results of operations. Lindorff entered into new
collection services contracts and successfully negotiated contract extensions with existing clients.
Furthermore, notwithstanding the increase in market competition, Lindorff was able to price its
purchases in such a way that we believe Lindorff has a competitive advantage when bidding, with the
end result that Lindorff’s overdue receivables and debt portfolios have increased appreciably. Lindorff
has secured loan servicing capabilities in certain key markets, including Spain, Germany, the
Netherlands, Poland and Baltics, and recently increased its focus on secured loans. Lindorff also
recently entered into new business areas of RES. These developments were enhanced by the Aktua
Acquisition in 2016 that included a number of long-term services contracts within secured loans and
RES. Lindorff may also expand these operations into other jurisdictions. This has enlarged Lindorff’s


-----

addressable market, as secured claims constitute the majority of the loans and other overdue
receivables available for purchase and for third party collection.

During the global financial crisis (2008-2010), the credit management market was volatile. Customers’
repayment profiles were extended, which led to longer estimated remaining collections (“ERC”)
horizons. In response to this development, Lindorff adopted a cautious approach and decreased its
portfolio purchases. Instead, Lindorff shifted its focus to debt collection. Performing both debt
collection and debt purchasing has helped Lindorff build a flexible and balanced business that we
believe is well-suited to capture the increased overall level of use of credit management services
across Europe. Regardless of whether a financial institution desires to manage its credit management
requirements by selling loans and other overdue receivables or by outsourcing its debt collection
function, Lindorff can offer these services and build a relationship with the client, enabling it to be the
preferred choice if and when that client decides to shift or expand its usage of credit management
services.

The global financial crisis accelerated the build-up of NPLs in the European banking system. Based on
the Company Market Study, we believe that the European bank NPL stock amounted to approximately
€1.1 trillion in 2015, representing more than 2.5x 2007 levels. While the stock is expected to remain
stable, outsourcing of debt collection to specialized credit management companies is expected to
continue as banks focus on core activities. Furthermore, according to the Company Market Study,
increased regulatory pressure will continue to drive strong growth in NPL sales as stricter regulations
and increased provisioning levels have incentivized banks to de-lever and sell NPLs.

**_Purchases of Debt Portfolios at the Right Price_**

Lindorff’s ability to purchase debt portfolios at the right price has been a key driver of its results of
operations in the periods under review and is expected to continue to be a key driver going forward.
Purchased debt consists mainly of portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables purchased at
prices significantly below the nominal total collectible value on the debt and which are recognized at
amortized cost. We expect Lindorff to achieve collections in excess of the portfolio purchase price, and
as of March 31, 2017 Lindorff’s ERC was 2.24 times its carrying value of purchased debt.

When purchasing portfolios, Lindorff engages in an extensive valuation of the portfolio in order to
determine what price it should offer the client, see _“Business—Lindorff: Operations and Service_
_Offerings—Debt Purchasing—Valuation and Due Diligence.” Lindorff’s performance is dependent on_
its ability to purchase portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables that meet its investment criteria,
including prices that generate an appropriate return on purchased debt. After purchasing a portfolio,
Lindorff’s performance is further dependent on its ability to generate gross collection levels at or in
excess of its expectations for that portfolio. Lindorff has strong secured loan servicing capabilities and
recently increased its focus on secured loans. These loans entail some additional complexity with
respect to pricing and forecasting. For example, secured loans have different risk and collection
profiles than the unsecured loans and receivables that have historically been Lindorff’s main focus.

The global financial crisis reduced the propensity of debt originators to sell overdue receivables as
prices decreased and also led to difficulties for debt purchasers with obtaining funding for purchases
of portfolios in 2008 and 2009. During this period, collection levels on portfolios decreased, thus
reducing overall portfolio performance. This impacted not only the pricing of new portfolios, but also
existing portfolios that debt purchasers owned at the time and which were typically secured under
existing funding arrangements. Consequently, the years surrounding the global financial crisis created
challenges for debt purchasers to obtain funding. Lindorff was able to adapt quickly to these
challenging market conditions. During this time, its portfolios were primarily sourced from financial
institutions in the Nordic region, and Lindorff was able to mitigate the impact of the adverse market
conditions by changing its collection strategies and adopting solution rates (i.e., expected collection
relative to the principal amount) with long-term repayment profiles. The lower purchase prices resulted
in reduced propensity of debt originators to sell overdue receivables. Instead, they shifted focus to
debt collection services. Due to Lindorff’s full service business model, it was able to adapt its business
mix and meet this client demand. Pure debt purchasers, who lacked in-house debt collection


-----

operations, were unable to react in this manner. Similarly, when the markets started to recover again
in 2010, and pricing levels became increasingly attractive for sellers, Lindorff was able to respond
rapidly by increasing portfolio purchases. We believe that Lindorff’s balanced business model allows
it to adapt to a changing market environment and the dynamics of supply and that this ability to adapt
to shifts in the debt purchase and servicing markets will continue to mitigate the effect such shifts will
have on its results of operation moving forward.

From January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2016, Lindorff invested €911 million to purchase portfolios of
loans and other overdue receivables, including deliveries under forward flow agreements. 2015 was a
significant year for Lindorff as it invested €395 million, which included the purchase of two major
portfolios in the Nordics from Nordea and DNB, compared with an investment of €241 million in debt
purchasing in 2016 (in addition to various acquisitions, including the Aktua Acquisition). As of
December 31, 2016, 81% of the total collectible value on purchased debt of Lindorff’s portfolios across
its geographic markets consisted of NPLs originated by financial institutions, with the remaining
approximately 19% representing overdue receivables from clients in other industries. As of December
31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 Lindorff had ERC of €2.6 billion, €2.4 billion and €2.0 billion, respectively,
and, as of March 31, 2017, it had ERC of €2.6 billion. The resulting carrying value of purchased debt
in Lindorff’s IFRS consolidated statement of financial position was €1,176 million, €1,070 million and
€809 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, and €1,169 million and
€1,061 million as of March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The continuing increases in the carrying
value of Lindorff’s purchased debt was driven by Lindorff’s ability to purchase greater volumes of debt
portfolios, as appropriate, as well as the increased number of debt portfolios available for purchase.
The decrease in carrying value of purchased debt as of March 31, 2017 compared to December 31,
2016 was driven by amortization exceeding new portfolio purchases in the three months ended
March 31, 2017.

The table below presents information on the debt portfolios that Lindorff purchased during the periods
under review. In any period, Lindorff purchases portfolios that can vary in age, type and ultimate
collectability, which results in period-to-period variation in average prices paid and total collectible
value on purchased debt.

There are two principal models for purchasing portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables: oneoff agreements and forward flow agreements, see “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations of Intrum Justitia—Key Factors Affecting Intrum Justitia’s Results_
_of Operations—Purchases of Debt Portfolios at the Right Price.” As of December 31, 2016, 2015 and_
2014, Lindorff had invested €57 million, €63 million and €66 million, respectively, in forward flow
agreements and for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 it had invested €11 million and
€14 million, respectively, in forward flow agreements. Forward flow agreements are typically not longterm contracts. Nevertheless, while the terms of Lindorff’s current forward flow agreements provide no
medium- to long-term assurance on purchasing levels, most of these contracts are with existing
partners with whom Lindorff has established relationships, and we expect that many of these contracts
will be renewed based on our experience with such contracts in the past.

Lindorff’s full-service business model allows it to offer flexible pricing arrangements to its clients that
are tailored for the specific circumstances of the client and the relevant portfolio. Lindorff is increasingly
partnering and co-investing with financial investors that lack debt collection capabilities in the purchase


-----

of large debt portfolios, including secured loans. In such cases the co-investor typically retains the
majority of the investment. Lindorff targets minority holdings in the range of 20-50% in co-investment
structures, where it provides third-party debt collection services to its co-investor(s), servicing 100% of
the portfolio. Co-investment is beneficial for a number of reasons: (1) such arrangements typically
provide Lindorff with a large portfolio to perform debt collection through master servicing agreements,
while Lindorff also generates debt purchasing gross collections equal to its share of the investment,
(2) these arrangements enhance Lindorff’s ability to purchase large portfolios, (3) they give Lindorff the
opportunity to cooperate with external expertise and purchase diverse asset pools, (4) they enable
Lindorff to diversify risk as Lindorff shares the risk with a partner and can purchase interests in several
portfolios as opposed to a single one and (5) they facilitate Lindorff’s entry into new markets and
support building both purchase and collection capabilities early on in a new jurisdiction. If Lindorff
invests an average of 25% in each of its co-investments (assuming it receives a servicing fee of 75%
on the portfolio), we believe that Lindorff can generate an increase in its expected rate of return of 3%
compared to if it would have purchased the entire portfolio without co-investors. Co-investments’
impact on the revenue split between debt collection and debt purchasing depends on the size of
Lindorff’s minority holdings. For example, if Lindorff were to invest less than 35% of the capital in a
co-investment, then the portfolio contributes a larger share to debt collection (assuming servicing
100% of the portfolio). Conversely, if Lindorff were to invest more than 35% of the capital, then debt
purchasing revenue will be higher than debt collection revenue from that particular portfolio.

In the Baltics, we co-invested in a mixed portfolio in which our contribution to the total investment
amount of approximately €110 million amounts to €21.6 million, where we collect on 100% of the
portfolio. In Spain, we co-invested in a secured portfolio, with our contribution to the total investment
amount of approximately €90 million amounts to €8 million, where we collect on 100% of the portfolio.

Lindorff’s ability to purchase portfolios has historically depended on its internally generated funding
resources and its access to financing at the time portfolios become available for purchase. For the
periods under review, Lindorff funded its purchases of portfolios, working capital needs and other
expenditures with cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under the Lindorff Existing
Revolving Credit Facility. See “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
_of Operations of Intrum Justitia—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional information on the_
capital resources we expect to be available after giving effect to the Transactions.

**_Competition and Pricing_**

Competition and pricing levels in the markets in which Lindorff operates affect its ability to successfully
and profitably purchase portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables and carry out its debt
collection services. The European credit management market is fragmented, consisting of several
thousand companies with varied profiles. In recent years, we believe that there has been a trend
towards increased concentration of the credit management industry with credit management
companies, such as Intrum Justitia, Hoist Finance, Portfolio Recovery Associates (due to their
acquisition of Aktiv Kapital) and Lindorff, expanding in scale as core clients, in particular financial
institutions, are increasingly placing value on high-quality data assets acquired over an extended
period of time, a robust compliance framework, a multi-national presence and long-term relationships
with credit management companies. In addition, reputation and ethical behavior are important
competitive advantages in order to maintain relationships with current and potential clients, especially
financial institutions. The pricing element of debt collection services has become, and continues to be,
increasingly competitive across all markets and resulted in decreased pricing levels for such services
during the periods under review. By leveraging Lindorff’s size, experience and portfolio acquisition
model, we believe Lindorff has been able to succeed in this competitive environment across its various
jurisdictions.

Portfolios of unsecured consumer NPLs, which is where Lindorff has historically focused its debt
purchases, have become subject to increasingly competitive pricing as financial institutions have taken
a strategic view to divest these types of portfolios. As these portfolios have grown in size and value,
this has become an attractive sector and existing market participants, together with new market


-----

entrants, have intensified competition and pricing. Furthermore, the increased price levels are largely
due, we believe, to the claims sold being “fresher,” already paying or in the legal and enforcement
stage of collection, as opposed to older, non-paying claims depending on voluntary payments, which
is the pattern for portfolios in some of the markets Lindorff has entered more recently. The global
financial crisis led to unattractive pricing levels for purchases of portfolios in 2008 and 2009, mainly as
a result of reduced ability of customers to repay their debt, reduced propensity of debt originators to
sell overdue receivables and difficulties for debt purchasers to obtain funding, but markets started to
recover again in 2010 and pricing levels have been advantageous during the periods under review.
Unlike companies that do not offer debt collection services, its balanced operations provide an efficient
tool in this competitive landscape. Since Lindorff generates steady revenue and cash flow from its debt
collection services, Lindorff can selectively choose which NPL portfolios to bid for and does not have
to purchase portfolios we believe are priced too high simply to ensure sufficient cash flow into the
operations. With respect to secured loans, an area in which Lindorff recently increased its focus, the
portfolios are often of considerable size and the competitors are typically large portfolio investors, such
as investment funds. Flexible pricing arrangements, such as partnering and co-investing with financial
investors in the purchase of large debt portfolios, provides Lindorff with a competitive advantage in
bidding processes. In this competitive landscape, its EBITDA margin has improved from 32% in the
year ended December 31, 2014 to 39% in the year ended December 31, 2016. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to Our Industry and Business—We are active in competitive markets and may be unable_
_to continue to successfully compete with businesses that may offer more attractive prices, benefit from_
_less expensive funding or pursue lower return requirements than us.”_

**_Gross Collection Levels_**

Lindorff primarily generates revenue from: (a) fees and commissions received from claims on which it
perform debt collection services, pursuant to contracts that typically contain “no cure no pay” payment
terms, which means that Lindorff is paid only if it is able to successfully collect on a claim; and (b)
payments received from customers linked to claims in Lindorff’s purchased debt portfolios. The ability
and willingness of a customer to pay depends on several factors, such as his/her employment status,
the availability of funds and asset ownership. We believe that Lindorff’s business benefits from the
quality of the data that it can build about a customer’s circumstances and the analysis it can perform
on such data in order to confirm the customer’s employment status and/or asset ownership, for
example, and assess his/her ability or willingness to pay, and ultimately determine the best collections
strategy for individual customers.

Lindorff has a large and diverse collection of portfolios that have delivered consistent and stable
revenue over time. As of December 31, 2016, Lindorff received approximately 8.9 million payments,
and it had approximately 9.6 million claims in stock as of December 31, 2016.

**_Gross Collection Levels on Debt Collection Services_**

Since Lindorff’s client contracts for debt collection services are typically entered into on a “no cure no
pay” basis, its debt collection revenue is directly linked to its gross collection levels. The volume of
loans and other overdue receivables outsourced to Lindorff by its third-party collection clients, and
consequently its revenue from debt collection services, is linked to Lindorff’s historic ability to collect
on overdue debt and on its relationships with its debt collection clients, including Lindorff’s ability to
demonstrate strong gross collection levels. Different types of asset classes and different jurisdictions
have different collection profiles and contract types. For example, RES on behalf of third-party clients
is connected with and exposed to real estate prices and secured loans have different risk and
collection profiles than the unsecured loans and receivables that have historically been Lindorff’s main
focus. In addition, RES contracts typically have a two-fold payment structure, with one payment
component being linked to collection levels in line with the standard described above, while the other
component is based on certain other criteria, such as certain actions carried out. By achieving strong
collection levels, Lindorff can maximize the amount recovered by its clients, as well as the fees and
commissions it receives on a particular claim. Lindorff’s debt collection clients actively manage the
outsourcing process by benchmarking its collections performance against that of its competitors on a


-----

regular basis. Depending on the outcome of such benchmarking, Lindorff’s clients may release more
claims to it or, conversely, if Lindorff has performed poorly compared to its peer group, reduce the
number of claims that it services. Lindorff offers flexible pricing arrangements to its debt collection
services clients that are tailored for the specific circumstances of the client and the relevant claims to
be outsourced. We believe that the benefits of Lindorff’s effective claims collection strategy are evident
through its many long-standing client relationships where it is seen as a trusted, important and
strategic business partner by entering into a master servicing agreement to provide collection services
on the client’s loans and other overdue receivables that Lindorff has not purchased. For more
information about Lindorff’s debt collection services, see “—Key Operating Metrics for Debt Collection
_Services.”_

_Gross Collection Levels on Purchased Debt_

After Lindorff purchases a portfolio, it typically manages the portfolio in-house. Revenue generated
from claims in connection with its purchased portfolios is impacted by the gross collection levels that
Lindorff is able to achieve. As Lindorff keeps the entire amount it collects on purchased portfolios, it
can strategically allocate additional resources and costs to optimize collection and increase collection
levels on a specific portfolio, until it reaches the stage when the resources and costs required exceed
the expected revenue. We believe that Lindorff’s ability to convert non-paying claims into paying claims
on its purchased portfolios illustrates the degree of accuracy of its analysis conducted through its data
assets and analytical capabilities and the effectiveness of its scalable, multi-channel collections
approach and we further believe that Lindorff operates its forecasts with an appropriate balance
between prudent pricing and strong collection performance. From January 1, 2014 to March 31, 2017,
Lindorff collected 105% of its cash flow forecasts. During 2009 and 2010, following the global financial
crisis, Lindorff experienced a change in market dynamics where there was an increase in its collection
costs, while customers were unable to pay back their loans on previous levels. This resulted in
Lindorff’s actual collections being lower than its projected collections (based on its pricing model at
the time of purchase). In order to mitigate the effects of the prevailing conditions, Lindorff shifted its
collection strategies from more costly methods, such as bailiffs, to less expensive alternatives, such as
long-term payment plans. After adapting its collection strategies in this way, Lindorff managed to meet
its collection estimates and, during the periods under review, actual collections on its owned portfolios
have consistently exceeded projected collections based on its pricing model at the time of purchase.

**_Collection Costs and Operational Efficiency_**

Optimizing customer contact at each stage of the collection life cycle is the key to Lindorff’s debt
collection strategy. Its debt collection process is standardized and automated, with the goal of
maximizing the total amount collected over the life of the debt through sustainable payment plans or
affordable settlements achieved through an amicable and solution-oriented collection approach rather
than exploiting short-term collection potential. Lindorff benefits when purchasing a portfolio since any
effects resulting from allocating additional resources and cost to collect to such portfolio is attributed
to Lindorff, whereas in debt collection the additional resources and cost merely produce a marginal
increase in commissions and in many cases require Lindorff’s client to accept a higher commission in
order for Lindorff to benefit from the additional revenue generated. Debt purchasing does not require
Lindorff’s client to take this risk, but the client can anyway realize some of the benefit by receiving an
attractive price level.

Costs representing 18% of Lindorff’s net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 were variable,
_i.e., attributable to phone, postage and packaging, print, temporary staff, legal fee cost, travel and_
consulting fees (compared to 17% for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 18% for the year ended
December 31, 2014). The ratio of variable costs to revenue for the twelve months ended March 31,
2017 was 18% (compared to 17% for the twelve months ended March 31, 2016). The stability in
variable costs as a percentage of revenue during the years ended December 31, 2014 to 2016 was due
to a continued focus on cost control and operational excellence. For example, in June 2014, Lindorff
established LBS, its in-house center of excellence that supports the Lindorff companies by providing
back-office type services to improve efficiency, quality of services and market responsiveness and to


-----

utilize scale and skill advantages, consolidate functions and further develop knowledge sharing within
the organization. Lindorff’s fixed costs are limited almost entirely to office accommodation, permanent
staff, data platform, compliance and IT infrastructure expenses, providing it with scalability with a low
level of incremental overhead costs. Lindorff’s fixed costs as a percentage of revenue decreased
during the years ended December 31, 2014 to 2016 from 50% to 43% reflecting increased scalability
and operational efficiency.

Certain of Lindorff’s collection costs in a given period are largely variable because they are primarily
driven by collection activity performed in such period. Such costs mainly comprise temporary staff,
legal fees (including bailiffs), phone, postage and packaging, customer information services, travel and
consulting fees and commissions to external debt collectors. Lindorff uses external debt collectors in
cases where it has purchased debt portfolios that were already outsourced by the debt originator to
the external debt collector, and thus it is more efficient in Lindorff’s view to retain this relationship. The
aggregate commissions Lindorff pays to external debt collectors vary period-on-period. Lindorff’s
collection cost ratio for debt collection services, calculated as its direct operating expense for its debt
collection segment over the total operating revenue for its debt collection segment, decreased from
58% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 49% for the year ended December 31, 2016, and from
59% for the three months ended March 31, 2016 to 52% for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
The decrease in Lindorff’s collection cost ratio for debt collection services was mainly driven by
increased operational efficiency and increased scale as it managed to increase the number of thirdparty portfolios serviced while controlling its investment in collection resources. Lindorff’s collection
cost ratio for debt purchases, calculated as its direct operating expense for the debt purchasing
segment over gross collections, decreased from 31% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 29%
for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in this period was mainly due to lower average
commission rates, which in turn was partly due to increased collection efficiency in Lindorff’s debt
collection department and partly due to a change in country mix towards countries with relatively
cheaper collection services. The collection cost ratio for debt purchases increased from 28% for the
three months ended March 31, 2016 to 29% for the three months ended March 31, 2017.

The table below sets forth Lindorff’s collection costs and its collection cost ratios for the periods under
review.

Year-on-year trends in Lindorff’s collection cost ratio are not necessarily indicative of its operational
efficiency and the return on capital it can achieve on purchased debt, as they are impacted by the
varying characteristics of the portfolios it purchases in different years and differences in the timing of
portfolio purchases during the year. Specifically, we believe that recent trends in Lindorff’s collection
cost ratio have been driven by: (i) significant improvements in the operational efficiency of Lindorff’s
collections team, primarily due to its implementation of more efficient collection methods, such as text
messages and other automated processes, and a well-balanced level of operating expenses; and (ii)
changes in the volume, mix and timing of portfolio purchases in each year.

Operational efficiency is key to Lindorff’s business model and a main advantage of its business
compared to competitors and financial institutions and other customer companies who handle their
debt collection in-house. Lindorff begins the debt collection process by segmenting or scoring
customers according to the predicted likelihood that they will pay, based on criteria such as past
payment history, size and type of debt, customer’s age and gender and whether the debt was incurred
by a consumer or a business. Lindorff thereafter determines which collection method to use for the
specific claim, such as calls, letters, text messages, emails and to some extent personal visits by
agents, depending on various factors, including the geographical market, the claim size, the client
Lindorff is acting on behalf of, the applicable laws and regulations and the individual customer. We
believe that Lindorff is able to lower collection costs due to its large scale and automation of the debt
collection process and Lindorff is able to increase recovery rates through its data assets and analytical
capabilities to optimally tailor debt collection strategies based on past experiences. As a result, we
believe that Lindorff can optimize collection efficiency over the lifetime of the claim.

Lindorff has systematically carried out projects that have had, and that we believe will continue to have,
a positive effect on its operations. Lindorff has divested a number of non-core activities and smaller
businesses during the periods under review. In addition, in June 2014, Lindorff established LBS in
Vilnius, Lithuania. LBS is an in-house center of excellence that supports the Lindorff companies by
providing back-office type services to improve efficiency, quality of services and market
responsiveness and to utilize scale and skill advantages, consolidate functions and further develop
knowledge sharing within the organization. LBS employs over 200 FTEs and has thus far primarily
contributed to the operations in high-costs countries, such as the Nordics, but expansion across
Lindorff’s jurisdictions is planned. Lindorff is currently in the process of implementing various collection
system models and evaluating opportunities to consolidate collection systems across the markets in
which it operates. Lindorff established LBS IT Shared Service Center (“SSC”) in Wroclaw, Poland in
December, 2016. SSC supports Lindorff in its application of IT-related solutions and product
development, it supports the near-shoring of existing IT services and it operates as a back-up facility
for LBS. In addition, Lindorff has systematically worked to improve its basic IT infrastructure, and has
moved from operating a unique IT platform in each local operation to having one IT infrastructure
platform, operated by its IT outsourcing provider, which services most of its local operations. We
believe that over time Lindorff will be able to realize savings in the consolidation of its IT infrastructure
and designated SSC center.

**_Cost Saving Measures_**

Lindorff has improved, and plans to continue improving, its earnings and cash flow by reducing
operating costs within its business through a number of measures, such as staff optimization and
reducing employee costs, restructurings and site consolidations, IT optimization, procurement,
outsourcing and other operational efficiency initiatives and reducing consultancy fees. For example, in
June 2014, Lindorff established LBS in Vilnius, Lithuania, its in-house center of excellence. In addition,
Lindorff has completed site consolidations of offices in Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway
and Sweden. As a result of these and other cost saving measures, Lindorff’s employee benefit
expense, legal fee cost and phone, postage and packaging expense all decreased as a percentage of


-----

revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to the three months ended March 31,
2016.

In connection with the development and implementation of these cost saving measures, Lindorff has
incurred non-recurring cash expenses, in particular for capital expenditures, staff related expenses and
consulting fees in an annual aggregate amount of €6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016
and €5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and
2016, Lindorff recorded non-recurring expenses relating to these cost saving measures in an
aggregate amount of €1 million and €2 million, respectively. Lindorff plans to continue reviewing its
operations at all levels to identify potential cost savings and expects to incur additional non-recurring
cash expenses in connection therewith in future periods. See “Management Discussion and Analysis
_of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Intrum Justitia—Cost Saving Measures” for a_
discussion of cost saving measures in connection with the Merger.

**_Seasonality_**

The timing of Lindorff’s purchases of portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables is likely to be
uneven during a financial year and from year to year due to fluctuating supply and demand within the
market, with a corresponding impact on leverage and earnings. Lindorff has generally purchased more
portfolios, measured by purchase price, in the fourth quarter (when debt originators in general, and
financial institutions in particular, often seek to sell assets) compared to each of the first three quarters.
For example, in 2016 Lindorff purchased 59% of its portfolios in the fourth quarter. However, there may
be exceptions in certain years where purchases of major individual portfolios are made in other parts
of the year, such as in 2013 and 2014, when Lindorff purchased 39% and 34%, respectively, of its
portfolios in the second quarter, and Lindorff’s interim results for any given quarter may be impacted
by the timing of the closing of a specific portfolio purchase. We believe that the fourth quarter will likely
continue to be the most important quarter for financial institutions’ management of their financial
positions and thus when Lindorff’s portfolio purchase levels will be highest. The ECB Asset Quality
Review, various stress tests and the increased importance of quarterly reporting in the financial
calendars of larger institutions, may result in a more even flow of sales throughout the year. Lindorff’s
interim results for a given quarter may also be impacted by seasonal factors, such as whether Easter
occurs in the first or second quarter of the year. The seasonality described above impacts Lindorff’s
consolidated income statement as returns generated through debt collections on its purchased
portfolios, and amortization of such portfolios, are recognized in its consolidated income statement as
described in more detail in “—Recognition of Purchased Portfolios, Revenue Recognition, Estimation
_of Cash Flow Forecasts and Revaluation of Purchased Portfolios.”_

Debt collection is also highly affected by seasonal factors related to customers, including the number
of work days in a given month, the propensity of customers to take holidays at particular times of the
year and annual cycles in disposable income. Collections within portfolios tend to have high seasonal
variances, while Lindorff’s costs are more evenly spread out over the year, resulting in high variances
of margins and profitability between quarters. Lindorff’s margins are generally lower in the first quarter,
whereas its collections will be seasonally higher in the second and fourth quarters of the year, due to
customers’ receipt of tax refunds, holiday bonus payments and other factors.

**_Acquisitions and Geographic Expansion_**

Lindorff has a strong track record of expanding into new markets and making strategic acquisitions
and carve-out transactions. Lindorff has been able to successfully integrate new businesses into its
existing operations, achieve its strategic plans and leverage its strong client relationships to acquire
businesses and assets from some of the largest financial institutions in Europe. During the periods
under review, Lindorff’s expansion has consisted of acquisitions of other debt collection companies, as
well as so-called carve-out transactions. A carve-out transaction means that Lindorff purchases a
collection unit, typically from a financial institution, and that it thereby takes on the entire or parts of the
collection function from such institution, including employees, IT and collection systems and portfolios
of loans and other overdue receivables. In connection with carve-out transactions, Lindorff often also
enter into a long-term service agreement to provide debt collection services to the financial institution


-----

doing the carve-out. These acquisitions and carve-outs have allowed Lindorff to enhance its business
intelligence capabilities and local collection knowledge and generate steady streams of revenue. We
also believe that carve-outs have the benefit that Lindorff can integrate the carved-out collection unit
into its existing operations and with its collection knowledge, thereby achieving stronger collection
returns than the selling financial institution for whom debt collection is a non-core business.

The value of the assets of the carve-out transaction is allocated to Lindorff’s consolidated statement of
financial position according to the purchase price analyses as identified tangible and intangible assets,
and the residual purchase price is allocated as an intangible asset (client relationship) and amortized
over the stipulated contract period. Acquisitions and carve-out transactions made during the periods
under review were carried out to enter into new geographic markets or to further penetrate existing
geographic markets, enter into long-term debt collection services agreements with specific financial
institutions and complete a value chain, for example by establishing a local platform to better service
a particular market. Expanding into a new geographic market may affect Lindorff’s overall balance
between debt collection services and debt purchasing, should the new market be particularly focused
on one of these business areas. Geographic expansion may also serve to diversify its business and
enhance its ability to manage the overall balance between debt collection services and debt
purchasing.

Lindorff acquired businesses and completed carve-out transactions for a total purchase price of
€379 million during the periods under review. Its recent acquisitions and carve-outs include five of
significant scale:

- In December, 2014, Lindorff completed the 2014 Spanish Acquisition, in which it acquired a
carved-out collection unit from Banco Sabadell in Spain. This acquisition was the then-largest in
the history of Lindorff, with an acquisition price of €159 million. In connection with the acquisition,
Lindorff entered into a long-term service agreement with Banco Sabadell to carry out part of its
debt collection.

- In August, 2015, Lindorff acquired 100% of the ordinary share capital of Casus Finanse SA, a
leading credit management company in Poland.

- In May 2016, Lindorff acquired the entire share capital of Cross Factor S.p.A., an Italian company
operating in credit management services.

- As described in more detail below, in June 2016, Lindorff acquired 93.66% of the shares of Aktua
for a consideration of €134 million, including deferred and contingent consideration. Lindorff
subsequently sold a stake representing 8.66% of Aktua’s share capital to the existing minority
shareholder, increasing the minority shareholder’s participation to 15% and reducing Lindorff’s
holding to the remaining 85%. Aktua is an independent multi-client debt collection service
provider in Spain, with strong relationships and significant contracts with the largest Spanish
financial institutions. Aktua offers servicing of secured loans, RES, fund management and related
servicing and debt portfolio merger and acquisition and NPL/real estate management consulting
services.

- In November 2016, Lindorff acquired HIT Hanseatische Inkasso-Treuhand GmbH (“HIT”), a debt
collection company in Germany, and DMV Debitorenmanagement-und Verwaltungsgsesellschaft
mbH (“DMV”), a company that provides services to HIT.

_Aktua Acquisition_

In addition to strengthening its position among credit management companies in Europe, the Aktua
Acquisition significantly strengthened Lindorff’s secured loans operations and marked its entrance into
RES. Prior to the Aktua Acquisition, Aktua entered into a contract with Ibercaja Banco, S.A. on February
2, 2016, pursuant to which Aktua acquired a subsidiary of Ibercaja Banco, S.A. and agreed to manage
certain real estate assets of Ibercaja Banco, S.A. and its subsidiaries for a period of 10 years. The new
RES capabilities acquired as a result of the Aktua Acquisition involve servicing, maintenance and sale
of real estate owned by Lindorff’s clients (i.e., not recorded on the balance sheet of Lindorff). RES is


-----

an adjacent service along the credit management value chain that we consider to be complementary
to NPL servicing in Lindorff’s focus on offering an integrated value proposition across the whole value
chain. We believe there is significant potential to export and roll out both RES and secured loans
capabilities to other geographic markets in which Lindorff is already present in order to complement
its service offering to existing and potential clients.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2017, Aktua contributed €62 million of Adjusted EBITDA
(excluding NRIs) to Lindorff (as consolidated from June 1, 2016).

**_Economic Conditions_**

The economic and market conditions in the countries in which Lindorff operates can have various
effects on its operations. For example, adverse economic conditions and increased levels of
unemployment may lead to higher default rates on claims, which in turn may increase the stock of
portfolios available for Lindorff to purchase and positively impact its prospects of purchasing portfolios
and complete carve-out transactions with attractive returns. Similarly, negative economic
developments may increase the amount of loans and other overdue receivables possessed by
Lindorff’s debt collection clients, thereby potentially increasing the number of claims outsourced to
Lindorff for collection. If adverse economic conditions materially reduce the ability of customers to
repay their debts, Lindorff’s revenue from both debt collection services and debt purchasing could
decrease. Adverse economic conditions could also reduce debt originators’ propensity to sell overdue
receivables at the prices prevailing in the market, thereby decreasing the volume of portfolios of loans
and other overdue receivables available for Lindorff to purchase and, thereafter, sales by debt
originators could increase as debt originators seek to sell portfolios in order to free up capital, thereby
increasing the volume of loans and other overdue receivables available for Lindorff to purchase. This
trend has been evident in the last eight years; the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 led to
dramatic slowdowns in purchases of portfolios across the markets in which Lindorff operates followed
by a significant increase during the periods under review as debt originators sought to free up capital.
Unfavorable economic conditions may also impact Lindorff’s ability to obtain funding and thereby its
ability to purchase portfolios.

Improved economic conditions are likely to lower default rates on loans, which could negatively impact
the growth of the stock of portfolios available for Lindorff to purchase, as well as decrease the amount
of loans and other overdue receivables possessed by its debt collection clients, which would
negatively impact its debt collection services. Generally, gross collection levels improve in times of
decreased levels of unemployment. As a result, positive economic conditions could also be beneficial
as they would enable customers to increase repayments and enable customers who were previously
unable to pay their debts to have new payment plans arranged, thus increasing Lindorff’s revenue from
both debt collection services and debt purchasing. Positive economic conditions may also increase
the underlying credit stock, driven by higher private consumption and continued low interest rates, in
turn driving the amounts of consumer credits.

In the markets in which Lindorff operated during the periods under review, Spain has seen large
volumes of debt portfolios being sold and the market is expected to continue providing attractive bank
carve-outs and NPL purchasing opportunities, particularly within the secured debt segment. Similarly,
debt sales in Italy have experienced a significant increase. The positive development is expected to
continue driven by, inter alia, conversion of semi-performing loans. In both Spain and Italy outsourcing
ratios for consumer NPLs are expected to increase, in particular for secured consumer NPLs. In the
Nordics, Sweden has also seen a positive development in debt sales volumes as banks increasingly
prefer selling off debt to clean up their balance sheets. We expect this positive trend to continue, in
particular for consumer unsecured NPLs, as both the NPL stock and debt sales are expected to grow
supported by increased lending as economy grows and consumer confidence improves.

**_Foreign Currency Effects_**

Lindorff currently has local operations in Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania,
the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain and Sweden. Lindorff liquidated its Russian operations in
March 2017. Many of its subsidiaries transact business and report their financial results in currencies
other than the euro, Lindorff’s consolidated reporting currency. Accordingly, its results of operations
were subject to currency effects, primarily currency translation exposure during the periods under
review. Transaction-related exposure at Lindorff’s subsidiaries was limited because revenue and costs
were largely incurred in their respective operating currencies. In addition, funding of Lindorff’s
operations from the Lindorff Existing Revolving Credit Facility was converted from euro into local
currencies and aligned with the portfolios purchased. For those countries with a reporting currency
other than euro, profits and losses were translated into euro at average exchange rates, and assets
and liabilities were translated into euro at closing exchange rates. Fluctuations in exchange rates
against the euro resulted in period-on-period differences in Lindorff’s results of operations and can
obscure period-on-period comparisons, for example between the quarterly results of two different
years. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, 38%, 42% and 48%, respectively, of
Lindorff’s revenue was reported by entities whose functional currencies were different than the euro,
primarily Norwegian kroner, Swedish kronor and Danish kroner, which accounted for 23%, 9% and 3%,
respectively, of its revenue in 2016, 26%, 11% and 4%, respectively, of its revenue in 2015 and 30%,
12% and 5%, respectively, of its revenue in 2014. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and
2016, 35% and 41%, respectively, of Lindorff’s revenue was reported by entities whose functional
currencies were different than the euro, primarily Norwegian kroner, Swedish kronor and Danish
kroner, which accounted for 23%, 6% and 3%, respectively, of its revenue in the three months ended
March 31, 2017 and 24%, 10% and 4%, respectively, of its revenue in the three months ended
March 31, 2016. As a significant portion of Lindorff’s revenue and results of operations in Norway is
linked to debt collection, fluctuations in the exchange rate between Norwegian kroner and euro can
have a disproportionate effect on Lindorff’s debt collection revenue. Lindorff is expanding its
operations in existing markets, as well as considering growth opportunities in new markets, mainly
where euro is the operating currency and thus we expect the impact of foreign currency translation to
be moderate as Lindorff grows further.

**_Tax Effects_**

The statutory corporate tax rate in Sweden for each of 2016, 2015 and 2014 was 22%. Lindorff’s
effective tax rate in 2016 was 263%. The high effective tax rate, adjusted for issues relating to certain
ongoing tax cases, was mainly due to net financing costs including unrealized currency losses in
Sweden for which Lindorff had not recognized a deferred tax asset. Lindorff’s effective tax rate in 2015
and 2014 was 28% and 34.6%, respectively, primarily due to varying income tax rates in the
jurisdictions in which it operates, ranging from 15% in Lithuania to 31% in Germany, as well as the
non-deductibility of certain expenses. In addition, Lindorff had certain tax losses in 2014 for which no
deferred income tax asset was recognized. For additional information on income tax expense, see
Note 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements of Lock Lower Holding as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2016 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**Factors Affecting the Comparability of Lindorff’s Financial Condition and Results of Operations**

As further described under “Presentation of Financial and Other Information,” Lock Lower Holding was
established on May 22, 2014, and its only assets consist of its indirect interest through Lock AS in the
share capital of Lindorff AB, which it acquired on October 6, 2014, upon completion of the Prior Lindorff
Acquisition, and intercompany loans to Lock AS. The consolidated financial statements of Lock Lower
Holding and its consolidated subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014,
accordingly, only reflect Lindorff’s results of operations from October 6, 2014 to December 31, 2014.
As a result, for the year ended on or prior to December 31, 2014, we have included and primarily
discussed in this Offering Memorandum the consolidated financial statements of Lindorff AB rather
than those of Lock Lower Holding. For historical periods commencing on or after January 1, 2015, we
have included and primarily discussed in this Offering Memorandum the consolidated financial
statements of Lock Lower Holding rather than those of Lindorff AB.


-----

Due to the factors discussed above, the comparability of the consolidated financial statements of
Lindorff AB and the consolidated financial statements of Lock Lower Holding may be limited. The bullet
points below set forth the impact of the Prior Lindorff Acquisition on certain line items of the
consolidated income statements and statement of financial position of Lindorff AB and the combined
income statement and statement of the financial position of Lock Lower Holding that effect their
comparability.

**_Items of the Consolidated Income Statement_**

- _Total Income: For the year ended December 31, 2015, Lock Lower Holding had total income of_
€534 million, which was €6 million less than Lindorff AB and related to internal services provided
to Lindorff from Lindorff AB to Lock AS and Lock Lower Holding for the year ended December 31,
2015.

- _Employee benefit expense: For the year ended December 31, 2015, the employee benefit_
expense of Lock Lower Holding was €187 million, which included employee costs of €1 million
that were not included in the employee benefit expense of Lindorff AB for the year ended
December 31, 2015.

- _Other operating costs: For the year ended December 31, 2015, the other operating costs of Lock_
Lower Holding was €100 million, which included consultancy fees of €3 million that were not
included in the other operating costs of Lindorff AB for the year ended December 31, 2015.

- _Net finance costs:_ On October 6, 2014, upon completion of the Prior Lindorff Acquisition,
€1,119 million of the funding package was on lent to Lindorff AB with a portion of the proceeds from
the sale of the applicable Lindorff Existing Notes. See Note 23 to Lindorff AB’s audited combined
financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 included elsewhere in this
Offering Memorandum. Only a portion of the debt incurred by Lock Lower Holding in connection
with the Prior Lindorff Acquisition was on-lent to Lindorff AB. Accordingly, the amount of expenses
and finance costs reflected in the consolidated financial statements of Lock Lower Holding differ
from those reflected in the combined financial statements of Lindorff AB. As a result of this, and
foreign currency exchange effects related to the Notes, the net finance costs of Lock Lower Holding
for the year ended December 31, 2015 were €172 million, which were €97 million more than the
net finance costs of Lindorff AB for the year ended December 31, 2015.

- _Profit and loss before tax: As a result of the differences highlighted in bullet points 1-4 above, the_
profit and loss before tax of Lock Lower Holding for the year ended December 31, 2015 was a
loss of €23 million, which was a €99 million difference to the profit before tax of Lindorff AB for
the year ended December 31, 2015.

- _Income tax expense:_ As a result of the differences highlighted in bullet points 1-4 above, the
income tax expense of Lock Lower Holding for the year ended December 31, 2015 was positive
€6 million, which was €10 million less than the negative income tax expense of Lindorff AB for
the year ended December 31, 2015.

- _Profit and loss for the year: As a result of the differences highlighted in bullet points 1-4 above, the_
profit and loss for the year of Lock Lower Holding for the year ended December 31, 2015 was a
loss of €16 million, which was an €88 million difference to the profit of Lindorff AB for the year
ended December 31, 2015.

**_Items of the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position_**

- _Intangible assets: As of December 31, 2015, Lock Lower Holding recorded intangible assets of_
€327 million and goodwill of €1,384 million, of which €83 million and €607 million, respectively,
were not recorded on the statement of financial position of Lindorff AB, which was due to the Prior
Lindorff Acquisition.


-----

- _Deferred income tax assets: As of December 31, 2015, Lock Lower Holding recorded deferred_
income tax assets of €71 million, of which €17 million were not recorded on the statement of
financial position of Lindorff AB, which was due to losses carried forward at Lock AS.

- _Other long-term assets: As of December 31, 2015, Lock Lower Holding recorded other long-term_

€0 million, while Lindorff AB recorded shareholder loans of €1,478 million on its statement of
financial position, which relate to an intercompany proceeds loan of €1,119 million granted to
Lindorff AB with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the applicable Lindorff Existing Notes
in the Prior Lindorff Acquisition, subsequent intercompany loans related to portfolio purchases
and debt restructuring in Lindorff AB, and interest accumulated to the principal in the period.

- _Deferred income tax liabilities: As of December 31, 2015, Lock Lower Holding recorded deferred_
income tax liabilities of €47 million, of which €21 million were not recorded on the statement of
financial position of Lindorff AB, which was due to deferred tax liability on brand name recorded
in connection with the Prior Lindorff Acquisition.

- _Short-term loans: As of December 31, 2015, Lock Lower Holding recorded short-term loans of_
€242 million, of which €241 million were not recorded on the statement of financial position of
Lindorff AB, which was due to the incurrence of €206.5 million under the Existing Lindorff
Revolving Credit Facility at Lock AS and accrued interest on secured bonds in Lock AS for a total
amount of €34.5 million.

- _Short-term liabilities: As of December 31, 2015, Lock Lower Holding recorded other short-term_
liabilities of €58 million, which was €54 million less than were recorded on the statement of
financial position of Lindorff AB, which was due to contribution from Lindorff AB to Lock AS and

**_Items of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow_**

- _Results from operating activities: For the year ended December 31, 2015, the results from_
operating activities of Lock Lower Holding was €150 million, which included employee costs of
€1 million that were not included in the results from operating activities of Lindorff AB for the year
ended December 31, 2015.

- _Interest paid: Only a portion of the debt incurred by Lock Lower Holding in connection with the_
Prior Lindorff Acquisition was on-lent to Lindorff AB. Accordingly, the amount of expenses and
finance costs reflected in the consolidated financial statements of Lock Lower Holding differ from
those reflected in the combined financial statements of Lindorff AB. As a result of this, the interest
paid of Lock Lower Holding for the year ended December 31, 2015 was €152 million, which was
€49 million more than the interest paid of Lindorff AB for the year ended December 31, 2015.

- _Decrease/increase in other receivables: For the year ended December 31, 2015, the decrease in_
other receivables of Lock Lower Holding was negative €4 million, which was a €7 million
difference to the increase in other receivables of Lindorff AB for the year ended December 31,
2015, which was due to ordinary course operating activity intercompany balances derived from
the level below Lock Lower Holding and which are settled on the level of Lock Lower Holding.

- _Decrease/increase in accounts payable: For the year ended December 31, 2015, the decrease in_
other payables of Lock Lower Holding was negative €2 million, which was a €6 million difference


-----

to the increase in accounts payable of Lindorff AB for the year ended December 31, 2015, which
was due to ordinary course operating activity intercompany balances derived from the level below
Lock Lower Holding and which are settled on the level of Lock Lower Holding.

- _Increase in long-term liabilities: For the year ended December 31, 2015, the increase in long-term_
liabilities of Lock Lower Holding was €671 million, which was a €364 million difference to the
increase in long-term liabilities of Lindorff AB for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was
due to only a portion of the debt incurred by Lock Lower Holding in connection with the Prior
Lindorff Acquisition being on-lent to Lindorff AB, as described above.

- _Retirement of debt: For the year ended December 31, 2015, the retirement of debt of Lock Lower_
Holding was €327 million due to repayment of the previous credit facility, which was not included
in the statement of cash flow of Lindorff AB for the year ended December 31, 2015.

- _Other financial expenses: For the year ended December 31, 2015, the other financial expenses of_
Lock Lower Holding was €8 million due to certain consultancy fees, which were not included in
the statement of cash flow of Lindorff AB for the year ended December 31, 2015.

**Recognition of Purchased Portfolios, Revenue Recognition, Estimation of Cash Flow Forecasts**
**and Revaluation of Purchased Portfolios**

The following sections describe how the IFRS accounting under the amortized cost methodology
recognizes the carrying value of purchased debt in Lindorff’s consolidated statement of financial
position, and the returns generated through debt collections on such portfolios in its consolidated
income statement. These IFRS measures are derived from a number of other measures that are not
defined in IFRS and which involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity, including EIR and ERC,
and these are areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to Lindorff’s Financial
Statements.

**_Recognition of Purchased Portfolios_**

Purchased debt consists mainly of portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables purchased at
prices significantly below the nominal total collectible value on purchased debt and which are
recognized according to IAS 39 (or, for any annual periods beginning on or after January 2018,
according to IFRS 9) for loans and receivables, _i.e., at amortized cost using the effective interest_
method. According to the effective interest method, the carrying value of each portfolio corresponds
to the present value of estimated gross future cash flows discounted by an EIR determined on the date
the portfolio was purchased. The initial EIR is based on the relation between purchase cost and the
projected future cash flows on the purchase date.

With the projection of future gross cash flows and the purchase price including transaction costs as a
basis, each portfolio is assigned an initial EIR that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments
or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period
to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability at the time of purchase of the
portfolio based upon estimated debt collections over the next 180 months that is then used to discount
expected cash flows through the life of the portfolio. Portfolios with higher decay are estimated to have
collections close to zero over the last few years of the life of the portfolio. If appropriate, the EIR is
reassessed and adjusted up to 12 months after the purchase of the portfolio to reflect refinements
made to our estimates of future cash flows based on enhanced data and analysis considered during
that time period. This adjustment has historically not resulted in any material impact on Lindorff’s
income from purchased portfolios.

Current cash flow projections are monitored over the course of the year and updated based on, among
other things, achieved collection results and agreements reached with customers on instalment plans.
Cash flow projections are made at portfolio level. If the cash flow estimates are revised, the carrying
amount is recalculated to reflect revised estimated cash flows by computing the present value of
estimated future cash flows using the initial effective interest rate. An adjustment in the carrying amount
is recognized in net revenue.


-----

Changes over time in the book value can be divided into a time and interest rate component and a
component related to changes in estimates of future cash flows. Changes in cash flow forecasts are
treated symmetrically, i.e., both increases and decreases in forecast flows affect the portfolios’ book
value and, as a result, net revenue. The value of a portfolio is gradually amortized during the course of
the expected life of the portfolio, leaving a carrying value of €0 at the end of the rolling ERC investment
horizon.

From time to time, Lindorff also purchases portfolios on a forward flow basis. In a forward flow
agreement, Lindorff agrees to buy claims at a pre-defined price or price range for a given volume and
quality from a client on an ongoing basis. Claims under forward flow agreements can be delivered on
weekly, monthly or quarterly basis and the EIR of these claims is calculated per contract and used for
each delivery of claims. If experience indicates a change in the attributes of claims under a specific
agreement, Lindorff may decide to apply a new EIR for future claims. Each delivery under a forward
flow agreement is treated as an individual portfolio purchase, using its own purchase cost and the
pre-determined EIR. For reporting purposes, all individual deliveries under a forward flow agreement
are added to the overall portfolio as an incremental purchase. These claims can therefore be assessed
both by delivery and by portfolio. The ability to assess claims by delivery has the advantage that
Lindorff can monitor performance more closely and react with corrective actions more quickly than
would be the case if Lindorff could only assess claims by portfolio, in which case Lindorff would have
to wait until any indication of non-performance would have an impact on the portfolio as a whole.

Lindorff is increasingly partnering and co-investing with financial investors that lack debt collection
capabilities in the purchase of large debt portfolios. In such cases the co-investor typically retains the
majority of the investment and, as a result, only Lindorff’s proportionate share of such portfolios is
recorded in Lindorff’s consolidated statement of financial position and Lindorff’s proportionate share of
revenues and earnings of such portfolios are recorded in Lindorff’s consolidated income statement.
Lindorff’s aggregate ERC includes ERC contributions from each of the portfolios of loans and other
overdue receivables purchased through co-investment agreements with the amount of ERC
contributed by each such portfolio proportionate to Lindorff’s investment in the relevant portfolio.

**_Recognition of Revenue from Purchased Portfolios_**

Revenue on portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables is accrued monthly based on each
portfolio’s EIR. Monthly cash flows that are greater than the cash flow forecast for the same period are
recorded as an increase in revenue in the period. Conversely, monthly cash flows that are lower than
the cash flow forecast for the same period are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period.
Compensation received from debt originators due to price adjustments made to purchased portfolios
are recorded as an adjustment to the book value.

(6)  Purchased debt is recorded at purchase cost.

If actual collections on purchased portfolios of loans and receivables differ from forecasted collections,
the difference is added to the computed income from purchased portfolios. This means that in cases
where collection performance on a purchased portfolio exceeds forecast, the level of amortization will
remain unchanged while such collection performance will have a positive effect on income from
purchased portfolios and therefore on net revenue.

**_Estimation of Cash Flow Forecasts from Purchased Debt_**

The estimation of cash flow forecasts _(i.e., ERC) is a key uncertainty within Lindorff’s policies on_
revenue recognition of purchased debt. Lindorff establishes estimates of cash flows that determine the
EIR for each purchased portfolio. The estimates are based on Lindorff’s collection history with respect
to portfolios comprising similar attributes and characteristics, such as date of purchase, debt
originator, type of receivable, customer payment histories, customer location, and the time since the
original charge-off, as well as on Lindorff’s experience and the existing schedule of repayment plans
on the particular portfolio for which it is determining an EIR.

**_Revaluation of Purchased Debt_**

At the end of each reporting period, currently every quarter, Lindorff evaluates portfolio forecasts to
assess whether there is objective evidence that a portfolio should be subject to revaluation. Indications
of negative revaluation may include a group of customers experiencing significant financial difficulty,
default of interest or principal payments, the probability that customers will enter bankruptcy or other
financial reorganization, and observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the
estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with
defaults. Conversely, there can also be positive revaluation in the event that a portfolio displays
objective evidence of expected cash flows above the current forecast.

Lindorff revalues the portfolios based on the rolling ERC at the revaluation date. The local management
in the countries where Lindorff has operations regularly review and follow up on the portfolios. Lindorff
group management carries out quarterly reviews of all portfolios with actual debt collection deviating
more than 25% and €100,000 from forecasts during the last six months (cumulative). Lindorff
management will also review portfolios that do not meet these thresholds, but that have been
nominated for formal review by local management based on their regular review of portfolios.
Revaluation may also occur, with respect to new portfolios, where the EIR is to be recalculated based
on new forecasts within 12 months from the date of acquisition or, with respect to forward flow
agreements, where there has been over- or under-performance. This structure aims to ensure that
portfolios performing significantly outside of forecast will be reviewed by management. A formal review
meeting is required prior to adjusting forecasts. The outcome of the review meeting may be:
(i) adjustment of the forecast, which will influence the carrying value of purchased debt in Lindorff’s
statement of financial position and the revenue in its income statement; and/or (ii) in cases of
underperforming portfolios, a decision to implement actions or measures to increase the performance
of the portfolio and to review the portfolio again at the next review meeting.

**_Key Operating Metrics for Purchased Debt_**

During the periods under review, Lindorff has experienced significant growth in its asset base and cash
flow generation, which it believes is the result of: (i) the growing volume of portfolios Lindorff has been
able to purchase; (ii) its pricing discipline; (iii) the efficiency and sophistication of its debt collection
operations; and (iv) carve-out transactions.

includes portfolios as part of the acquisition of Casus Finanse SA in 2015.

As described under “—Revenue Recognition, Revaluation of Purchased Debt and Estimation of Cash
_Flow Forecasts,” the IFRS consolidated statement of financial position carrying value of purchased_
debt is based on our latest ERC forecast for Lindorff’s owned portfolios. As a result, we believe it is
important to assess Lindorff’s purchased portfolios by analyzing the development of its ERC.

Vintages of portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables acquired as part of business acquisitions correspond to the
year of acquisition of such business by Lindorff.

ERC growth over time is primarily due to portfolio purchases; as Lindorff collects on existing portfolios,
the ERC on these portfolios will decline. During the periods under review, there have not been any
material changes in forecast expectations at the overall portfolio level. Lindorff’s ERC on purchased
portfolios grew from €1,971 million as of December 31, 2014 to €2,621 million as of March 31, 2017.
The table below sets forth ERC on purchased portfolios as of the periods indicated.

Based on Lindorff’s models, as of March 31, 2017, it estimates that the aggregate total collectible value
of purchased portfolios of €19 billion would generate approximately €2,621 million in gross collections
over the next 180 months. Lindorff expects to receive 15% of these collections during the period from
April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018 and 28% of these collections during the period from April 1, 2017 to
March 31, 2019. These expectations are based on historical data as well as assumptions about future
collection rates. There can be no assurances that Lindorff will achieve such collections within the
specified time periods, if at all.

**_Returns on Purchased Debt_**

While returns achieved on an individual portfolio can vary, Lindorff has a consistent record of unlevered
returns on its aggregate purchased debt. Lindorff has experienced increased gross cash-on-cash
multiples as portfolios mature. The table below sets forth certain data related to Lindorff’s purchased
debt by vintage, such as purchase price, collections, ERC and gross cash-on-cash multiple as of
March 31, 2017. It demonstrates Lindorff’s ability to continue to extract value from its purchased debt
over a long period of time.

(1)  Vintage corresponds to the year of acquisition of a purchased portfolio of loans and other overdue receivables by Lindorff.
Vintages of portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables acquired as part of business acquisitions correspond to the
year of acquisition of such business by Lindorff.

(2)  The purchase price of portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables acquired as part of business acquisitions
represents the fair value of such portfolios allocated as part of the purchase price accounting of such acquisition.

(3)  Total Estimated Collection means the collections to date plus ERC.

(4)  Gross Cash-on-Cash Multiple means the actual gross collections before collection costs received on a portfolio of loans
and other overdue receivables to the date that the multiple is measured, plus the ERC before collection costs from the date
of purchase of the portfolio, divided by the total amount paid for the portfolio at the date of purchase.

While the Gross-Cash-on-Cash Multiple typically increases overtime as portfolios mature, the GrossCash-on-Cash Multiple can vary between vintages due to the timing of portfolio purchases and the
resulting carrying value of purchased debt in a specific vintage. The aggregate return Lindorff achieves
on all of its vintages can be calculated as follows:

**Description of Principal Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Line Items**

The following is a discussion of Lindorff’s key consolidated statement of financial position line items.

**_Purchased Debt_**

Purchased debt consists mainly of portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables purchased at
prices significantly below the nominal total collectible value on purchased debt and which are
recognized at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The carrying value of each portfolio
corresponds to the present value of estimated gross future cash flows discounted by an EIR. The initial
EIR is based on the relation between purchase cost and the projected future cash flows on the date of
purchase.

**Description of Principal Income Statement Line Items**

The following is a discussion of Lindorff’s key income statement line items.

**_Net revenue_**

Net revenue consists mainly of fees from customers, fees and commissions from clients relating to
third-party debt collection services and revenue on purchased debt accrued monthly based on each
portfolio’s EIR. Changes in collection estimates resulting in a change in the carrying value of
purchased debt and cash collections in the period in excess of, or below, the forecast for the period
are also included here. The effects of the last two elements have been low historically.


-----

Purchases of portfolios increase Lindorff’s collections, although there may be a time lag between the
date of purchase of the portfolio and the increase in collections resulting from the purchase of such
portfolio, thus resulting in turnover being realized in a period subsequent to that of the portfolio
purchase. Collections on existing portfolios tend to decrease as the portfolios age.

**_Employee Benefit Expense_**

Employee benefit expense includes salary and other employee related expenses, such as vacation
accruals, social security taxes and pension costs.

**_Legal Fee Cost_**

Lindorff incurs outlays for bailiff/court fees, summons, legal representation and enforcement
authorities, which generally can be charged to and collected from customers. Such outlays are
expensed when incurred (even though collections are generated in subsequent periods), except in
certain cases where Lindorff has agreements with its clients that any expenses that cannot be collected
from the customer are instead refunded by the client. In these cases, the amount that is expected to
be recovered from the client is recognized as an asset in the statement of financial position.

**_Phone, Postage and Packaging_**

Phone, postage and packaging includes costs related to sending collection letters, text messages and
other communications in connection with establishing contact with customers in the collection
process.

**_Other Operating Costs_**

Other operating costs consist primarily of costs related to premises, external IT services, customer
information services, commissions to external debt collectors, travel and consulting fees.

**_Depreciation and Amortization_**

Depreciation and amortization includes the depreciation of tangible fixed assets and amortization of
intangible assets for the relevant period, based on the expected economic useful life of the assets.

**_Finance Income_**

Finance income includes interest on bank accounts.

**_Finance Costs_**

Finance costs consist of interest on loans from financial institutions, fair value gains and losses on
financial derivatives (interest swaps), in the case of Lindorff AB prior to the completion of the Prior
Lindorff Acquisition, interest expense on certain subordinated loans or, following the completion of the
Prior Lindorff Acquisition, the intercompany proceeds loans received from affiliates, and, in the case of
Lock Lower Holding, interest expense on the Lindorff Existing Senior Notes, the Lindorff Existing Senior
Secured Notes and the Lindorff Existing Revolving Credit Facility, the Aktua Facility Agreements, the
Lindorff and GS Bilateral Facility Agreement and the Lindorff and Nordea Bilateral Facility Agreement,
as applicable, net financial exchange gains/(losses) on financing activities, write down of investments
in associated companies and other financial expenses.

**_Income Tax Expense_**

The tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. The current income tax charge is calculated on
the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries
where Lindorff operates and generate taxable income. Tax positions are periodically evaluated and
positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to
interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid
to the tax authorities.


-----

Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected
to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. Deferred income tax is provided using the
liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax basis of assets and
liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.

ended March 31, 2016 to €50 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. The main reasons
for the increase were higher net interest bearing debt, a net foreign exchange loss in the three months
ended March 31, 2017 as opposed to a gain in the three months ended March 31, 2016 and costs
related to the additional funding secured through the Lindorff Bilateral Facility Agreements in October

ended December 31, 2015 to €208 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of
net revenue, employee benefit expense decreased from 35% in the year ended December 31, 2015 to
32% in the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the effect of foreign currency translation,
employee benefit expense increased by €23 million, or 12%, in the year ended December 31, 2016
compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was mainly due to higher number of
FTEs resulting from the Aktua Acquisition in the second quarter of 2016 and the full year effect of the
acquisition of Casus Finanse SA in the third quarter of 2015.

_Legal Fee Cost_

Lindorff’s legal fee cost increased by €4 million, or by 11%, from €43 million in the year ended
December 31, 2015 to €47 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of net
revenue, legal fee cost decreased from 8% in the year ended December 31, 2015 to 7% in the year

by €5 million, or 13%, in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended


-----

December 31, 2015. The increase was mainly due to the acquisitions of Aktua, Cross Factor S.p.A. and
Casus Finanse SA, as well as increases in regulatory fees in Norway.

_Phone, Postage and Packaging_

Lindorff’s phone, postage and packaging expense increased by €1 million, or by 6%, from €18 million
in the year ended December 31, 2015 to €19 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. As a
percentage of net revenue, phone, postage and packaging expense remained stable at 3% of net
revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016. Excluding the effect of foreign currency
translation, phone, postage and packaging expense increased by €1 million, or 7%, in the year ended
December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The relative stability despite the
high number of acquisitions is due to higher use of electronic communication, including the use of a
self-service portal and text messages, in communicating with debtors as electronic communication
involves lower costs than other means of communication.

_Other Operating Costs_

Lindorff’s other operating costs increased by €20 million, or 20%, from €100 million in the year ended
December 31, 2015 to €120 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of net
revenue, other operating costs remained stable at 19% of net revenue for the years ended December
31, 2015 and 2016. Excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, other operating costs increased
by €22 million, or 21%, in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December
31, 2015. The increase was driven by the Aktua Acquisition.

_Depreciation and Amortization_

Depreciation and amortization increased by €48 million, or 132%, from €37 million in the year ended
December 31, 2015 to €85 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of net
revenue, depreciation and amortization increased from 7% in the year ended December 31, 2015 to
13% in the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the effect of foreign currency translation,
depreciation and amortization increased by €49 million, or 132%, in the year ended December 31,
2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was mainly a result of
impairments of a collection contract in Spain (€30 million), IT software (€4 million) and amortization in
Aktua (€10 million).

_Net Finance Costs_

Lindorff’s net finance costs decreased by €16 million, or 9%, from €172 million in the year ended
December 31, 2015 to €156 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily
attributable to a net financial exchange gain in 2016.

_Income Tax Expense_

Lindorff’s income tax expense increased by €36 million, from a credit of €6 million in the year ended
December 31, 2015 to an expense of €30 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase
in income tax expense was partially attributable to certain ongoing tax cases concerning deductibility
of interest on group internal loans in Finland and Norway.

_Net revenue_

Lindorff’s net revenue increased by €59 million, or 12%, from €475 million in the year ended
December 31, 2014 to €534 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding the effect of
foreign currency translation, Lindorff’s net revenue increased by €71 million, or 15%, in the year ended
December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was driven by
investments in portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables, particularly two major portfolios in the
Nordics from Nordea and DNB, respectively, which resulted in strong net revenue growth in the debt
purchasing segment. The increase in net revenue was also driven by the full-year effect of the 2014
Spanish Acquisition. This acquisition was the then largest in the history of Lindorff. In connection with
the 2014 Spanish Acquisition, Lindorff entered into a long term service agreement with Banco Sabadell
to carry out part of its debt collection. The increase in net revenue was also partly driven by the
acquisition of Casus Finanse SA in Poland in the third quarter of 2015.

The table below sets forth, for each of the periods indicated, Lindorff’s operating revenue by segment,
both in euro and as a percentage of consolidated operating revenue, and the percentage increase or
decrease in operating revenue by segment from period to period. For a discussion on Lindorff’s
operating revenue by segment, see “—Results of Operations on a Segment Basis.”

(1)  Northern Europe consists of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands. Norway, Poland and Sweden.
This region previously included Russia however Lindorff liquidated its operations in Russia in March 2017. Lindorff’s
operations in Denmark, Estonia, Finland and Sweden are components of the Carveout Business that Nordic Capital has
committed to selling to address competition concerns raised by the European Commission. See “Summary—Divestment of
_the Carveout Business.”_

(2)  Central Europe consists of Germany.

(3)  Southern Europe consists of Italy and Spain.

_Employee Benefit Expense_

Lindorff’s employee benefit expense increased by €9 million, or 6%, from €178 million in the year
ended December 31, 2014 to €187 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding €1 million
of employee benefit expense related to Lock Lower Holding that was not included in the employee
benefit expense of Lindorff AB, employee benefit expense increased by €8 million, or 4%, in the year
ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. As a percentage of net
revenue, employee benefit expense decreased from 37% in the year ended December 31, 2014 to 35%
in the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, employee
benefit expense increased by €15 million, or 8%, in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to
the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was driven by an increased number of FTEs
resulting from the 2014 Spanish Acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2014 involving a collection unit in
Spain and the acquisition of Casus Finanse SA in Poland in the third quarter of 2015. The increase was
also due to severance payments paid out to Lindorff’s previous chief executive officer and other key
management positions. In addition, the increase in employee benefit expense was due to certain
measures, such as hiring employees to set up LBS in Vilnius, Lithuania, that we believe will have a costreducing effect going forward.


-----

_Legal Fee Cost_

Lindorff’s legal fee cost increased by €8 million, or by 24%, from €35 million in the year ended
December 31, 2014 to €43 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. As a percentage of net
revenue, legal fee cost increased from 7% in the year ended December 31, 2014 to 8% in the year
ended December 31, 2015. Excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, legal fee cost increased
by €9 million, or 27%, in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December
31, 2014. The increase was driven by increased legal fees in Spain as a result of Lindorff’s growing
activity in Spain due to the 2014 Spanish Acquisition, and increased collection activity automatically
results in increased legal fee cost. The increase in legal fee cost was also the result of an accounting
effect in the Netherlands, where legal fee cost was moved from before net revenue down to the
expense line, which had a neutral effect on Lindorff’s profitability.

_Phone, Postage and Packaging_

Lindorff’s phone, postage and packaging expense decreased by €1 million, or by 5%, from €19 million
in the year ended December 31, 2014 to €18 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. As a
percentage of net revenue, phone, postage and packaging expense decreased from 4% in the year
ended December 31, 2014 to 3% in the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding the effect of foreign
currency translation, phone, postage and packaging expense decreased by €1 million, or 5%, in the
year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was
driven by growing use of electronic means of communication with customers (such as Lindorff 24 and
text messages), which carry lower costs than traditional means of communication. The decrease in
phone, postage and packaging expense was also due to increased efficiency, as automation, accurate
scoring and other methods to optimize the collection process reduce the number of interactions
required with customers before successful collection.

_Other Operating Costs_

Lindorff’s other operating costs increased by €7 million, or 8%, from €93 million in the year ended
December 31, 2014 to €100 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding €3 million of
consultancy fees related to Lock Lower Holding that were not included in the other operating costs of
Lindorff AB, other operating costs increased by €4 million, or 4%, in the year ended December 31,
2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. As a percentage of net revenue, other
operating costs decreased from 20% in the year ended December 31, 2014 to 19% in the year ended
December 31, 2015. Excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, other operating costs
increased by €10 million, or 11%, in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2014. The increase was driven by consultancy and other costs related to the issuance
of Lindorff’s Notes and the acquisition of Casus Finanse SA in August 2015, as well as costs relating
to certain measures that we believe will have a cost-reducing effect going forward, such as site
consolidation of two offices in Denmark and start-up costs related to LBS, which include IT, lease of
premises and furniture.

_Depreciation and Amortization_

Depreciation and amortization increased by €21 million, or 134%, from €16 million in the year ended
December 31, 2014 to €37 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. As a percentage of net
revenue, depreciation and amortization increased from 3% in the year ended December 31, 2014 to
7% in the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding the effect of foreign currency translation,
depreciation and amortization increased by €21 million, or 136%, in the year ended December 31,
2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to amortization
related to the 2014 Spanish Acquisition in December, 2014, as well as amortization of software related
assets.

_Net Finance Costs_

Lindorff’s net finance costs increased by €64 million, or 60%, from €108 million in the year ended
December 31, 2014 to €172 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding €97 million of
interest expense for the Lindorff Existing Notes and the Lindorff Existing Revolving Credit Facility and


-----

other finance costs related to Lock Lower Holding that were not included in the finance costs of Lindorff
AB, net finance costs decreased by €33 million, or 31%, in the year ended December 31, 2015
compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to interest
expense on the Lindorff Existing Notes and foreign currency exchange effects related to the Lindorff
Existing Notes, as most of the Lindorff Existing Notes are denominated in SEK and EUR, while the
accounting currency of Lock Lower Holding is NOK. The increase in net finance costs was offset by
expenses recorded by Lindorff AB in 2014 related to Lindorff’s previous credit facility, which was
refinanced in 2014, thereby eliminating such expenses in 2015.

_Income Tax Expense_

Lindorff’s income tax expense decreased by €16 million, from negative €10 million in the year ended
December 31, 2014 to positive €6 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding €10 million
of positive income tax expense related to Lock Lower Holding, income tax expense decreased by
€6 million, or 60%, in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31,
2014. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily a result of recognition of substantial tax
losses carried forward related to shareholder loans in place prior to the Prior Lindorff Acquisition. The
decrease in income tax expense was offset by €27 million paid to tax authorities in Norway and Finland
related to contested tax claims, as described in “Business—Lindorff: Legal and Administrative
_Proceedings,” and €5 million paid as advance current tax in Finland._

_Net Profit/(Loss) for the Period_

Lindorff recognized a net loss of €16 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 and a net profit of
€18 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Excluding €92 million of losses related to Lock
Lower Holding, Lindorff recognized a net profit of €76 million in the year ended December 31, 2015.

**Results of Operations on a Segment Basis**

Lindorff determined its operating segments based on the information it reviews for purposes of
allocating its resources and assessing its performance. Net revenue from external parties reported to
Lindorff’s management is measured in a consistent manner in the income statement. Lindorff assesses
the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of “segment earnings,” which Lindorff
defines as total operating revenue of the segments less direct operating expenses of the segments,
which include all direct costs related to the execution of collection processes and exclude costs related
to IT and selling, general and administrative expense. Sales between segments are carried out at arm’s
length. For a reconciliation of segment earnings on a segment basis to Lindorff’s profit and loss before
tax, see Note 5 to Lock Lower Holding’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2016 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

Lindorff’s inter-segment collection of debt is organized and allocated according to a blueprint model in
one operational entity. Costs are allocated either to debt purchasing or to debt collection according to
actual resource consumption (“ABC costing”) or based on another relevant allocation base. Lindorff’s
debt collection department services the portfolios it purchases. These services are charged based on
actual resource consumption as if they were carried out between third parties, generating a reasonable
profit for the debt collection segment. There are a number of IT projects and services that are
organized as a shared function. These costs are charged to the segments in each country on an arm’s
length basis, applying segment or total net revenue as allocation key. Costs for employees in Lindorff’s
debt purchasing department are booked in the debt purchasing segment.

(1) Inter-segment net revenue includes the net revenue generated by Lindorff’s debt collection department from commission
charged on debt collection services carried out on portfolios Lindorff purchases. The cost for this commission is recorded
as a direct operating expense for Lindorff’s debt purchasing department, together with certain other costs. These items are
eliminated from the respective segments and recorded under eliminations and unallocated items.

(2)  Direct operating expense includes all direct costs related to the execution of collection processes and excludes costs
related to IT and selling, general and administrative expense.

(1) Inter-segment net revenue includes the net revenue generated by Lindorff’s debt collection department from commission
charged on debt collection services carried out on portfolios Lindorff purchases. The cost for this commission is recorded
as a direct operating expense for Lindorff’s debt purchasing department, together with certain other costs. These items are
eliminated from the respective segments and recorded under eliminations and unallocated items.

(2)  Direct operating expense includes all direct costs related to the execution of collection processes and excludes costs
related to IT and selling, general and administrative expense.

_Total Operating Revenue_

An analysis of Lindorff’s operating revenue by segment is set forth below:

_Debt collection: The operating revenue of Lindorff’s debt collection segment increased by €22 million,_
or 7%, from €336 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to €358 million in the year ended
December 31, 2015. Excluding the effect of foreign currency translation and inter-segment operating
revenue, debt collection operating revenue from external customers increased by €17 million, or 7%,
in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase
was mainly driven by the full-year effect of the 2014 Spanish Acquisition. This acquisition was the then
largest in the history of Lindorff. In connection with the 2014 Spanish Acquisition, Lindorff entered into
a long term service agreement with Banco Sabadell to carry out part of its debt collection.

_Debt purchasing: The operating revenue of Lindorff’s debt purchasing segment increased by_ €47
million, or 21%, from €220 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to €267 million in the year
ended December 31, 2015. Excluding the effect of foreign currency translation and revaluation of loans
and receivables, debt purchasing operating revenue from external customers increased by €48
million, or 22%, in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31,
2014. The increase was driven by investments in portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables,
particularly two major portfolios in the Nordics from Nordea and DNB, respectively.

_Other services: Operating revenue from other services increased by_ €2 million, or 12%, from €17
million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to €19 million in the year ended December 31, 2015.
Excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, Lindorff’s operating revenue from other services
increased by €3 million, or 18%, in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2014. The increase was mainly driven by the launch of Lindorff Payment.

_Segment earnings_

An analysis of Lindorff’s segment earnings by segment is set forth below:

_Debt collection: Lindorff’s segment earnings for debt collection increased by €12 million, or 9%, from_
€139 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to €151 million in the year ended December 31,
2015. The increase was driven by growing use of electronic means of communication with customers
(such as Lindorff 24 and text messages), which carry lower costs than traditional means of
communication. The increase in segment earnings was also due to increased efficiency, as
automation, accurate scoring and other methods to optimize the collection process reduce the number
of interactions required with customers before successful collection. Lindorff’s segment earnings
margin for debt collection increased from 41% in the year ended December 31, 2014 to 42% in the year
ended December 31, 2015.

_Debt purchasing: Lindorff’s segment earnings for debt purchasing increased by €25 million, or 22%,_
from €115 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to €140 million in the year ended December
31, 2015. The increase was driven primarily by investments in portfolios of loans and overdue
receivables. Lindorff’s segment earnings margin for debt purchasing remained stable at 52% in the
year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.

_Other services: Lindorff’s segment earnings for other services increased by €2 million, or 50%, from_
€4 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to €6 million in the year ended December 31, 2015.
The increase was driven by the launch of Lindorff Payment, for which the foundation was established
in 2014 and therefore could generate profitable growth in 2015.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Lindorff’s liquidity requirements have historically consisted mainly of debt and tax servicing
requirements and funding of its purchases of portfolios, capital expenditure and working capital.
Lindorff’s principal sources of liquidity during the periods under review have been its net cash
generated from operating activities (before portfolio purchases) and borrowings under the Lindorff
Existing Revolving Credit Facility as well as bank and capital markets debt.


-----

While Lindorff’s collections have historically been predictable throughout the year, its debt purchasing
activity can vary greatly from one quarter to the next. This is driven by the timing of one-off debt sales
by vendors during the year, the timing of which Lindorff does not control, along with Lindorff’s own
desire to purchase a portfolio at a given point in time. This could lead to volatility in Lindorff’s cash
balances quarter on quarter. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2015, Lindorff invested
€395 million in portfolio purchases, of which €230 million, or 58%, was purchased in the fourth quarter
of 2015. Similarly, for the year ended December 31, 2016, Lindorff invested €241 million in portfolio
purchases, of which €141 million, or 59%, was purchased in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Lindorff’s ability to generate cash from its operations depends on its future operating performance,
which is in turn dependent, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market,
regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as other factors discussed
in the section titled “Risk Factors.”

**_Working Capital_**

We believe that the working capital available to Lindorff is sufficient for the twelve months following the
date hereof.

**_Cash Flows_**

The following table sets forth the principal components of Lindorff’s cash flows for the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 and the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.

_Net cash generated from operating activities_

Lindorff’s net cash generated from operating activities increased by €17 million from net cash
generated from operating activities of €18 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016 to €35
million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in net cash generated from operating
activities was due to the contribution of Aktua.

Lindorff’s net cash generated from operating activities increased by €149 million from net cash
generated from operating activities of €90 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to €239 million
in the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to the contribution of
Aktua and lower investment in payment product receivables in 2016 compared with 2015.

Lindorff’s net cash generated from operating activities decreased by €105 million from net cash
generated from operating activities of €195 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to €90 million
in the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to an increase in interest
expense due to an increase in debt following the Prior Lindorff Acquisition and increased working


-----

capital activity connected to increased operations in Spain and ramp-up of Lindorff Payment. The
decrease was offset by strong net revenue growth in 2015.

_Net cash used in investing activities_

Lindorff’s net cash used in investing activities increased by €32 million from net cash used in investing
activities of €28 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016 to €60 million in the three months
ended March 31, 2017. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was due primarily to a
greater amount of cash being paid (as opposed to deferred payments) in acquisitions of portfolios in
the first quarter of 2017 compared with the first quarter of 2016.

Lindorff’s net cash used in investing activities decreased by €138 million from net cash used in
investing activities of €472 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to €334 million in the year
ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was due primarily to
lower levels of investment in portfolios in 2016 compared with 2015.

Lindorff’s net cash used in investing activities increased by €8 million from net cash used in investing
activities of €464 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to €472 million in the year ended
December 31, 2015. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was due primarily to
investments in portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables and the full-year effect of the 2014
Spanish Acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2014.

_Net cash from/(used in) financing activities_

Lindorff’s net cash from financing activities increased by €34 million from net cash from financing
activities of €5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016 to €39 million in the three months
ended March 31, 2017. The increase in net cash from financing activities in the three months ended
March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016 was primarily due to higher
proceeds from borrowings under the Lindorff Existing Revolving Credit Facility in three months ended
March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016.

Lindorff’s net cash from financing activities decreased by €232 million from net cash from financing
activities of €334 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to €102 million in the year ended
December 31, 2016. The decrease in net cash from financing activities was primarily related to the
effect of the receipt of proceeds from bonds issued in 2015.

Lindorff’s net cash from financing activities increased by €38 million from net cash from financing
activities of €296 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to €334 million in the year ended
December 31, 2015. The increase in net cash from financing activities was primarily related to
drawdowns under the Lindorff Existing Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Capital Expenditure_**

Historically, Lindorff’s capital expenditure consisted mainly of: (i) IT hardware; (ii) IT software and
development; and (iii) carve-out transactions, for which the part of the purchase price that exceeds the
book value of the acquired assets was allocated as an intangible asset (client relationship) and
amortized over the stipulated contract period.

Lindorff’s capital expenditure increased by €1 million, from €5 million in the three months ended
March 31, 2016 to €6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017, in line with usual business
fluctuations.

Lindorff’s capital expenditure decreased by €23 million, from €44 million in the year ended
December 31, 2015 to €21 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to the extension
to Lindorff’s existing carve-out from Banco Mare Nostrum, acquired in 2015.

Lindorff’s capital expenditure decreased by €146 million, from €191 million in the year ended
December 31, 2014 to €44 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, due primarily to the large


-----

capital expenditure in 2014 related to the 2014 Spanish Acquisition offset by increased investments in
IT in 2015.

**_Indebtedness and Certain Other Contractual Obligations_**

With the exception of the Lindorff Existing Loan Note Issuance Deed, all of the outstanding
indebtedness of Lindorff will be repaid as part of the Transactions. See “Summary—The Transactions”
and “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Intrum
_Justitia—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Indebtedness” for further information regarding our_
expected indebtedness after giving effect to the Transactions.

Lindorff uses operating assets through operating lease agreements, including leases for Lindorff’s
headquarters and other offices. The minimum remaining payments under such leases within the year
ended December 31, 2017 total €10 million with €26 million due on these leases in the following four
years (January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2021) and €9 million due on these leases thereafter.

**_Other Financial Obligations: Pension Obligations_**

For a description of certain pension plans and obligations of Lindorff, see Note 26 to Lock Lower
Holding’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016
included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Off Balance Sheet Arrangements_**

Lindorff purchases portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables by way of forward flow
agreements whereby it purchases non-performing debt based upon contracts that require Lindorff to
make multiple purchases from a vendor at a fixed price. Lindorff typically enters into forward flow
agreements with financial institutions. Lindorff invested €57 million, €63 million and €66 million,
respectively, in forward flow agreements in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
Lindorff invested €11 million and €14 million, respectively, in forward flow agreements in the three
months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and
_Industry—Failure to renew existing debt collection contracts or win new debt collection contracts may_
_adversely affect our revenue” and “Business—Lindorff: Operations and Service Offerings—Debt_
_Purchasing—Debt Purchasing Commercial Process.”_

Lindorff is not party to any other off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to
have, a current or future material effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditure or capital resources.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Financial Risk Management**

See Note 4 to Lock Lower Holding’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2016 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum for additional information
on Lindorff’s exposure to market risk and the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in
exchange rates, interest levels, refinancing and credit risks.

**_Market Risk_**

_Market and Regulatory Environment_

The main market risk is related to general macroeconomic conditions and local rules and statutory
regulations in each of the geographical markets in which Lindorff operates and which, in turn, affect
the customers’ ability to pay and Lindorff’s clients’ ability and willingness to sell portfolios of loans and
receivables and potential commission from third party collection.

_Foreign Exchange Risk_

Lindorff operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency
exposures, primarily with respect to Norwegian kroner and Swedish kronor compared to its reporting
currency, the euro. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognized


-----

assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations. Lindorff’s strategy is to manage and
limit currency risk. Exchange rate risk can be divided into transaction exposure and translation
exposure. Lindorff has investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign
currency translation risk. Currency exposure arising from the net assets of Lindorff’s foreign operations
is managed primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies.

_Transaction Exposure: In each country, revenue and operating expenses are mainly denominated in_
local currencies, and thus currency fluctuations have only a limited impact on Lindorff’s operating
earnings in local currency. National operations rarely have receivables and liabilities in foreign
currency. Revenue and expenses in national currency are thus hedged in a natural way, which limits
transaction exposure. The currency exposure that arises within the operating activities is limited to the
extent it pertains to international collection operations. The subsidiaries’ projected cash flow exposure
is not hedged at present. At Lindorff group level financing, both the debt collection and the debt
purchasing operations are funded in the relevant currencies reflecting the underlying expected cash
flow.

_Translation Exposure: Lindorff currently operates in 12 countries. The results and financial position of_
its subsidiaries are reported in the relevant foreign currencies and later translated into euro for
inclusion in Lindorff’s consolidated financial statements. 38% of Lindorff’s net revenue was generated
in foreign currency for the year ended December 31, 2016. Consequently, fluctuations in euro
exchange rates against these currencies affect Lindorff’s revenue and earnings, as well as equity and
other items in its financial statements. Lindorff’s net revenue is distributed by currency as follows:

If these currencies would have weakened/strengthened by 10% on average against the euro for the
year ended December 31, 2016, with all other variable held constant, net revenue would have
increased/decreased by approximately €24 million.

**_Credit risk_**

Credit risk is the risk that Lindorff’s counterparties are unable to fulfil their obligations to it. Each local
entity is responsible for managing and analyzing the credit risk for each of their new clients before
standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. Credit risk arises from assets, such
as cash and cash equivalents, guarantees and derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks
and financial institutions, as well as outstanding receivables, purchased loans and receivables and
outlays on behalf of clients. For financial assets owned by Lindorff, very limited collateral or other credit
reinforcements have been received. Therefore, the maximum credit exposure for each class of financial
assets corresponds to the carrying amount. There is also a limited risk of loss linked to Lindorff’s debt
collection services, however, this risk is primarily carried by its clients.

To minimize the risks related to purchase of portfolios, caution is exercised in purchase decisions.
Purchases are usually made from clients with whom Lindorff has maintained long-term relationships
and therefore has a thorough understanding of the receivables in question. Purchased loans and
receivables are usually purchased at prices significantly below the nominal value of the receivables,


-----

and are not collateralized. Lindorff retains the entire amount it collects, including interest and fees. For
more information about Lindorff’s purchased debt, see “—Purchased Debt.”

**Introduction**

Debt is created when a debt originator extends credit to a person, or a legal entity, who in turn
becomes a customer. Such arrangements occur routinely and include financial institutions extending
loans or trade sector companies (including, _inter alia, telecommunications and utilities companies)_
issuing invoices for services rendered. When a debtor does not repay the debt according to the terms
on which it was extended, the debt becomes overdue. Overdue debt is a structural component of the
credit industry, as debt originators typically expect a certain percentage of customers to default, and
price credit accordingly. Overdue debt is either collected by the originator itself or by a credit
management company, such as us.

**Overview of the European Credit Management Services and Debt Purchasing Industry**

There are a number of stages in the debt lifecycle and credit management companies offer several
services to clients throughout the cycle. A number of credit management services are exemplified in
the following illustration and described in the text below.

|---|---|


**_The Credit Management Services (CMS) industry can be divided into the following two_**
**_sub-segments:_**

_Payment, information and invoice services_

Before debt originators extend credit to debtors, credit management companies provide credit scoring
and other forms of credit information services such as data extraction and modelling. Credit
management companies also provide payment processing services including invoice administration,


-----

subsidiary ledger accounting, invoice printing, payment reminders and invoice purchasing. These
services are provided before debt is overdue.

_Debt collection_

Credit management companies provide debt collection services to debt originators for overdue debt.
The debt collection process consists of three phases: pre-legal, legal and enforcement and
surveillance. The pre-legal phase is the first stage in debt recovery and is where the collector seeks to
find a voluntary solution with the debtor, for example through a payment plan. If it is unlikely that the
debtor will pay voluntarily even if that person could afford to pay and/or was aware of the claim, the
case is moved to the legal and enforcement phase where the court system is used to find a solution,
for example through garnishment of wages or sale of collateral. If the debtor is insolvent and the claim
is uncollectable the case moves to the surveillance phase. During this phase, debtors are monitored
for any changes in personal circumstances, such as employment status, that may allow debtors to
commence payment.

**_Debt purchasing_**

Debt originators will often sell overdue debt to credit management companies through either: (i) a oneoff sale of an entire NPL portfolio; or (ii) a forward flow agreement where debt claims are sold at a predefined price for a given volume from a client on an ongoing basis. One-off agreements entail buying
a portfolio of claims that are received in one transaction upon payment. Forward flow agreements entail
buying a given volume of claims at a pre-defined price or price range from a client on an ongoing basis.

Selling overdue debt helps debt originators increase their liquidity, strengthen their balance sheets,
release resources to focus on early-stage delinquencies and reduce operational risks, reporting
requirements and regulatory demands. How overdue debt is sold is dependent on the debt originators
needs and balance sheet strategy. In the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis there was a
pressing need for financial institutions to quickly de-lever balance sheets and therefore NPL sales
focused on larger one-off transactions. Over the last years, we have observed a less immediate but
continuous need for banks to improve their capitalization, and as a result we see an increasing trend
towards forward-flow contracts as an additional measure for banks to manage NPL portfolios on an
ongoing basis. The decision to sell overdue debt can occur at one of several stages throughout the
debt collection cycle, depending on the type of debt, pricing and time since default. Typically, debt is
sold after more than one year in default and following the performance of various non-legal and legal
measures. As discussed below, the volume of debt sold by European debt originators has grown
significantly in recent years.

**Market Segments**

The markets for CMS and debt purchasing are typically generated from two sources: financial
institutions and trade. Debt can also be broken down by client type, _i.e., consumer (“B2C”) and_
corporate (“B2B”) debt.

_Financial institution generated debt_

Consumer debt originated by financial institutions primarily consists of bank loans and typically
includes mortgages, credit card loans, car loans, overdrafts and consumer loans. When such loans
become more than 90 days overdue, they are categorized as NPLs. These are typically characterized
by a relatively high average value and long collection times. Typically bank loans are further divided
into unsecured (e.g., credit card) and secured (e.g., mortgage) loans. We view the credit management
services market for debt originated by the financial institutions sector as highly sophisticated.

Historically, we have focused on unsecured consumer debt originated by financial institutions. Both
organizations have also been active in the secured consumer debt market segment. Lindorff further
expanded its footprint and capabilities in this market segment with the acquisition of Aktua in Spain.
Consequently, we define all consumer debt originated by financial institutions as our core addressable
market (the “Core Addressable Market”). According to the Company Market Study, the stock of NPLs


-----

in our Core Addressable Market amounted to €410 billion in 2015, representing approximately 4%
annual growth over the last five years, with the secured and unsecured consumer debt segments
growing at an average of 5% and 3% annually, respectively, from 2010 to 2015. In addition to our Core
Addressable Market we also address the market for B2B debt originated by financial institutions to
small and medium-sized enterprises (“SMEs”), and opportunistically cover the large corporates
segment, and therefore include the total European B2B market for debt originated by financial
institutions in our total addressable market (the “Addressable Market”). In geographical terms, our
Core Addressable Market and Addressable Market comprise EU28 countries and Norway. According
to the Company Market Study, the total size of the NPL stock in our Addressable Market amounted to
€1,058 billion in 2015, representing approximately 3% annual growth over the last five years, with the
SME and large corporate debt segments growing at an annual average rate of 2% and 3%,
respectively.

The illustration below provides a segmental overview of the estimated NPL stock (€ in billions) in our
Addressable Market for the year ended December 31, 2016.

_Trade_

Overdue trade receivables (“OTR”) mainly consist of overdue invoices from corporations. A number of
industries are included in the sector, such as telecommunication, public sector, retail and utility
companies. Compared to the financial institutions sector, debt portfolios originating from the trade
sector that are serviced or purchased by credit management companies typically consist of a larger
number of debt claims with a lower average value and relatively short collection times.

According to the Company Market Study, based on OTR annual generation, we estimate that the flows
of B2C bad debt for the trade segment in 2015 were approximately €70 billion, with telecom
companies and utilities representing approximately 50% of the market size. The market outlook for
overdue debt in the trade sector is expected to remain stable over the coming years.

**Key Drivers of the Credit Management Industry**

We expect that growth in the credit management services industry will continue in the near term as
positive macroeconomic developments improve debt collection rates and debt collection outsourcing
continues to increase due to an increased focus by clients on their core businesses.


-----

We have identified three main market trends that we believe are particularly important to the further
development of the credit management services industry, and in particular the financial institutions
sector:

- banks’ large build-up of NPLs in recent years;



- high sales volumes of NPLs as banks are under pressure to de-lever;

- continued creation of new NPLs leading to flat overall NPL stock; and

- clear industry value proposition resulting in increased volume of outsourcing.


_Banks’ large build-up of NPLs in recent years_

One of the key drivers of the European credit management market, in particular for companies with
large exposure to financial institutions, is the level of NPLs on banks’ balance sheets, and ultimately
banks’ inclination to divest or outsource collection on such debt. The global financial crisis (2008-2010)
accelerated the build-up of NPLs in the European banking system driven by, _inter alia, increased_
default rates coupled with limited NPL sales activity. Based on the Company Market Study, we believe
that the current European bank NPL stock amounted to approximately €1.1 trillion in 2015,
representing more than 2.5x 2007 levels. Based on the Company Market Study, we believe NPL ratios
have increased since pre-crisis levels, from an average of 3% in the period 2000-2008 to 5% in the
period 2009-15. To revert to pre-crisis levels, European banks would need to sell-off approximately
€0.5 trillion of the estimated 2015 stock of NPLs.

The graph below shows the development in the total European NPL stock originated from financial
institutions from 2008 to 2015.

_High sales volumes of NPLs as banks are under pressure to de-lever_


Annual total bank NPL sales volumes (at face value) increased from approximately €11 billion in 2010
to approximately €122 billion in 2015, corresponding to an average annual growth rate of 62%, or a
growth multiplier of 11x. There are a number of underlying factors for the increase in NPL sales
volumes. In addition to the back-log of NPLs on banks’ balance sheets, stricter regulations and
increased provisioning levels have incentivized banks to de-lever and sell NPLs. Selling NPLs often
provides banks with immediate benefits to liquidity and to the profit and loss statements as the overdue
NPLs sold has been substantially written down or written off.

Increased regulatory pressure and supervision (through, _inter alia, continuation of annual European_
Banking Authority stress-tests and stronger supervisory mechanisms, such as Single Supervisory
Mechanism, Single Resolution Board and European Systemic Risk Board) and higher capital
requirements for financial institutions as a result of Revised Basel III coupled with the implementation
of the new accounting standard IFRS 9 (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1,


-----

2018), is expected to further drive banks to strengthen their balance sheets and increase NPL sales. In
light of the aforementioned market drivers, we expect, as a base case scenario (the “Base Case
**Deleveraging Scenario”), that total NPL sales volumes originated from financial institutions will**
increase by 5-8% per year between 2015-2020. In addition to such a base case scenario we believe,
according to the Company Market Study, that there may be an alternative scenario according to which
there is an acceleration of banks’ deleveraging leading to significantly higher annual NPL volumes over
the coming years as the over-hang stock in the market (up to 50% of recognized NPLs or
approximately €477 billion) is sold down. In such a scenario (the “Accelerated Deleveraging
**Scenario”) the forecast of average annual growth in NPL sales volumes could be up to 14-17% for the**
period 2015 to 2020.

The graph below shows the development in European bank NPL sales volumes from 2010 to 2020.

Base Case Deleveraging Scenario

Source: Company Market Study

As part of banks’ deleveraging efforts, unsecured NPLs are typically sold off before secured NPLs due
to, _inter alia: (i) higher relative risk weight; (ii) higher provisioning levels; and (iii) lower transaction_
complexity. While the unsecured consumer NPL stock remains significant in Europe, we expect
relatively stable but sizable unsecured consumer NPL sales volumes over the coming five years. Based
on the Company Market Study, the total European unsecured NPL sales in 2020 is expected to be
€33- 37 billion, compared to €36 billion in 2015 and €13 billion in 2010. In the countries where Lindorff
has material presence, between 2017 and 2020, total unsecured NPL sales volumes are expected to
amount to €21 billion on average per year, which is well above the annual average of €13 billion for
the period 2010-2015. In terms of unsecured consumer NPL sales volumes, the Company Market
Study, also identifies a potential upside scenario, which, inter alia, entails a further market shift towards
forward flow arrangements. In that event, based on the Company Market Study, average annual
unsecured consumer NPL sales between 2017 and 2020 are expected to be €23 billion, in the
countries where Lindorff has a material presence.

Over the coming five years, as a result of the significant unsecured consumer NPL volumes observed
in recent years, we expect stronger growth in NPL sales volumes within the secured NPL segment. We
have established platforms, in particular given the acquisition of Aktua, enabling us to capture the
growth in the secured segments.

_Continued creation of new NPLs leading to flat overall NPL stock to be managed_

Over the coming five years, according to the Company Market Study, we expect the European bank
NPL stock to remain stable at approximately €1 trillion. This is driven by an overall increase in debt
levels of 1% per year and a decline in the NPL ratio of 0.6 percentage points over the period due to
improving macroeconomic environment and debt sales counterbalanced by additional inflow from the
semi-non performing stock in Southern Europe and new NPL production from the growing underlying
loan portfolio. Excluding NPL-sales, the NPL stock would grow at c. 10% p.a. to 2020.


-----

_Clear industry value proposition resulting in increased volume of outsourcing_

We have seen a trend of banks turning away from non-core activities and being unwilling to spend
resources on internal debt collection capabilities. At the same time, mature credit management
providers have emerged and added value to banks through their proven track record of improving
recoveries and scale benefits. Debt collection requires a substantial amount of resources and knowhow, and we believe this is performed most efficiently by specialists. Consequently, credit
management providers have become an integral part of the credit industry and are frequently viewed
as trusted partners to their clients. We believe that this relationship will continue to grow in the coming
years, especially in markets with lower outsourcing ratios, such as Germany and Italy. In a survey
among leading European banks and debt collection experts conducted in connection with the
Company Market Study, approximately 80% of the respondents indicated that they expect higher NPL
outsourcing levels over the next 5 years, compared to approximately 70% who expected increased
debt sales. According to the Company Market Study, we expect outsourced NPL volumes to grow by
an average annual growth rate of 1% in the countries where Lindorff has a material presence within our
historical core market, unsecured consumer debt originated from financial institutions.

In addition to the overall increase in outsourcing of debt collection, we also see a trend where clients
increasingly demand outsourcing solutions from credit management companies at a regional or panEuropean level. As a leading European credit management company, we believe that we are wellpositioned to benefit from this trend.

**Competitive landscape**

The European credit management services industry is a fragmented market consisting of several
thousand companies with varied profiles. When viewing the competitive landscape, three factors
should be considered:

- _Product offering: Companies either offer a full-service business model and operate in all stages_
of the credit management value chain, or they focus on particular areas, such as debt collection
or debt purchasing.

- _Geographic presence: Smaller participants tend to only operate in local markets. Medium and_
large companies typically have broader geographical footprints while only a few firms, including
us, have operations across several European countries.

- _Scale: The majority of firms are small or mid-sized and have a limited geographic presence, scale,_
skills, experience and information. In contrast, larger firms have the necessary scale to provide a
full-service offering.

Based on these considerations, the industry can be grouped into three categories of participants:

_Integrated pan-European credit management companies_

We are one of the few large credit management companies in Europe, which we define as being
present in more than five markets with an integrated offering throughout the credit management value
chain. These companies typically have operations in several countries and a broad service offering,
including both debt collection and debt purchasing. The large companies have experienced strong
growth and high profitability in recent years by capitalizing on scale in skills, experience, information
and origination sources.

The large integrated pan-European credit management companies generally have different focuses
and service offerings. We believe our full-service offering in combination with our focus on the financial
institutions sector is attractive to potential clients and will enable us to capture anticipated growth
opportunities across a variety of markets in the future.


-----

_Regional credit management companies_

Most European credit management companies are SMEs active only in a few local markets, and have
varying scale and business focuses. While these companies have a presence in their domestic
markets, they have a limited or non-existing international presence. This segment also consists of
several thousand participants without sizable operations who tend to focus on debt collection, as it has
lower scale requirements. In addition to smaller credit management companies focusing on debt
collection, there are a number of larger scale monoline players, which we define as having a presence
in less than five geographic markets and/or who predominantly focus on debt purchasing.

_Portfolio investors_

The third group of participants in the credit management industry comprises international investors
specializing in acquisitions of portfolios with distressed assets, such as Cerberus Capital Management,
Lone Star Funds and Fortress Investment Group. The core competency of portfolio investors is the
evaluation of portfolios and the raising of capital. Portfolio investors compete with other credit
management companies in the debt purchasing segment; however they can also be strategic partners
since they typically outsource debt collection. In recent years, we have created a co-investment vehicle
and acted as a co-investor together with portfolio investors to acquire portfolios and have handled the
debt collection process relating to the portfolios acquired.

**Our place in the industry**

The combination of Intrum Justitia and Lindorff creates the largest European credit management
provider by revenue and carrying value of purchased debt, with a leading position in several European
countries and business model focusing on financial institutions clients and a full-service offering and a
balanced business mix between third party debt collection and purchased loans and receivables.
Monoline and regional credit management companies (defined as companies present in less than five
geographical markets and/or focusing on debt purchasing), such as PRA Group, Cabot, Arrow, Hoist
and Kruk, are mainly active in debt purchasing with varying focus on either the trade or financial
institutions sector in only one or few jurisdictions. We believe that our full service offering offers tangible
benefits to our clients, provides diversification and allows us to extract operational and financial
synergies between debt collection and debt purchasing.

We enjoy strong market positions across the countries in which we operate. The illustration below
provides an overview of our geographical presence.

**Structural considerations: benefits for incumbents**

We believe that a number of structural factors operating within the European credit management
industry offer potential advantages for incumbent operators:

- _Client relationships: Debt originators, in particular financial institutions, are highly sophisticated_
and sensitive to reputational risk and are hence reluctant to switch credit management partners,
in particular to a new entrant that does not yet have an established track record and reputation.

- _Scale advantages: credit management is a scalable business with clear operational, strategic and_
financial scale benefits that provide a competitive advantage.

- _Data and pricing capabilities: A large database built over many years combined with strong data_
enhancement capabilities is valuable both for pricing portfolios and for developing collection
strategies.

### BUSINESS

_Except as expressly provided, this summary of the business of Intrum Justitia and Lindorff does not give_
_effect to the potential impact of divesting the Carveout Business on Intrum Justitia or Lindorff, as_
_applicable. See “Summary—Divestment of Carveout Business.”_

**Overview**

Upon completion of the Merger, we will be the leading credit management provider in Europe by
revenue, EBITDA and carrying value of purchased debt, with operations in 23 European countries and
a leading position in a majority of those countries. Intrum Justitia and Lindorff each provide a balanced
and integrated mix of services across the entire credit management value chain, including financial
services, and each company has a longstanding commitment to fair collection. Following the Merger,
we will benefit from greater scale of our operations and complementary sector expertise in debt
originated by the trade sector and the financial institutions sector, respectively. Using the existing
expertise of Intrum Justitia and Lindorff, we will provide:

- **_Credit Management Services (“CMS”). We employ tailored debt collection strategies and_**
solutions to maximize cash flow streams from loans and other overdue receivables for clients who
have decided to outsource their debt collection function. On a pro forma combined basis for the
twelve months ended March 31, 2017, we would have generated net revenue of SEK 6,922 million
(€728 million equivalent) from CMS, excluding revenue generated from portfolios of loans and
other overdue receivables that we own. As part of our CMS services, Lindorff has leading
capabilities in alternative solutions, such as carve-outs, which involves taking over the in-house
collection platform of financial institutions clients and conducting debt collection on behalf of the
financial institutions under a long-term contract. Lindorff also provides real estate servicing
(“RES”), which involves servicing of loans related to properties and other services related to the
security/property owned by its clients in Spain.

In addition to, and generally in combination with, collection services, we provide clients with a
wide range of value-added services, prior to loans and receivables becoming overdue, including
customer and credit information and analysis on individuals and companies across Europe to
help our clients assess their potential customers’ payment capacity, data extraction and
modelling, selection and scoring of potential customers, and a full suite of services relating to
accounts receivable, including invoicing, reminders and account ledger services.

- **_Financial Services. We offer a range of financial services. In particular, we purchase portfolios of_**
secured and unsecured loans and other overdue receivables from our clients for a portion of the
nominal value, which we then service using our in-house debt collection function, with a few
exceptions. Following the purchase of the defaulted receivables, our long-term debt collection
measures commence, aimed at helping consumers become debt-free as we help them reduce
their debt in a respectful manner, for example through installment plans that take account of each
consumer’s payment capacity. On a _pro forma_ combined basis for the twelve months ended
March 31, 2017, we would have generated net revenue of SEK 5,934 million (€624 million
equivalent) from Financial Services and, on a combined basis as of March 31, 2017, the ERC of
our portfolios of loans and overdue receivables would have been SEK 46,704 million
(€4,892 million equivalent), with a total collectible value on purchased debt of SEK 405,190
million (€42,444 million equivalent). As part of our Financial Services offering, we also provide
factoring, payment guarantees and e-commerce services.

We believe that the combination of debt collection and purchasing has been and will be key to Intrum
Justitia’s and Lindorff’s, and our continued, success. The range of services helps attract and retain
clients and increases the breadth and depth of collectible data, in turn supporting the creation of
tailored collection strategies and development of analytical capabilities to enable more accurate
pricing of portfolios. Operating across Europe and with a balanced business model also gives us
investment optionality as we can allocate resources across our platform and jurisdictions to the
opportunities that we find most attractive. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2017, our pro forma


-----

net revenue and Pro Forma Further Adjusted EBITDA was SEK 12,856 million and SEK 9,254 million,
respectively (€1,352 million and €973 million equivalent, respectively). See “Summary Consolidated
_Pro Forma Financial and Other Data of the Company—Pro Forma and Other Information of the_
_Company” and “Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information of the Company.”_

To address competition concerns raised by the European Commission following its investigation of the
Merger, Nordic Capital has committed to divesting the Carveout Business. See “Summary—Divestment
_of the Carveout Business.”_

**Our Strengths**

We believe that our business will benefit from a number of key strengths, including:

**_Europe’s leading credit management company_**

_The largest European credit management company._

We will be the largest European credit management company by revenue, EBITDA and carrying value
of purchased debt and will be significantly larger than the second largest credit management company
in Europe. Our EBITDA on a pro forma combined basis for the twelve months ended March 31, 2017
would have been SEK 4,787 million (€503 million equivalent). We believe our combined size will give
us several benefits. In particular, our combined experience will favorably impact our ability to
competitively price portfolios in our debt purchasing activities and develop optimal collection
strategies, which we believe will have a positive impact on our revenue and efficiency. Additionally, we
believe the increase in size of the Company should allow us to better absorb fixed costs, including
those related to regulatory and legal compliance and IT, which should further benefit our margins.

_Market leading position in several European countries._

We will be present in 23 European countries, which we believe is more than any of our European
competitors. Based on our internal estimates, we believe we will hold a leading position in the majority
of countries in which we operate. We believe our expanded geographic footprint combined with strong
local market positions is a competitive advantage which will further enhance our ability to follow our
clients across markets and deepen client relationships.

_Leading position in the European financial institutions segment for debt purchasing._

Based on the Company Market Study, we believe that we will hold a leading position among credit
management providers with respect to debt purchasing from financial institution clients in Europe. We
believe that the financial institutions segment in Europe represents one of the most attractive segments
of the credit management market. Financial institutions are the largest originator of debt and we believe
European bank NPL stock amounted to approximately €1.1 trillion in 2015, according to the Company
Market Study. The financial institutions segment also offers attractive economics with long durations
and earnings visibility. We have a long track record of collecting on NPLs and have built long-term
relationships with European financial institutions. During the three years ended December 31, 2016,
Intrum Justitia and Lindorff would have acquired NPLs with a total collectible value on purchased debt
of SEK 65 billion and €7.4 billion, respectively, from European financial institutions. These portfolio
purchases have been complemented by three strategic M&A transactions in the last three years, all of
which involved target companies focused on the financial institutions segment. For the year ended
December 31, 2016, 66% of our net revenue on a pro forma combined basis in our Financial Services
service line was generated by debt purchased from financial institutions.

_Leading position in the European trade segment for CMS and debt purchasing._

We believe, based on the Company Market Study, that we will hold a leading position among credit
management providers in the trade segment in Europe. We believe that the trade segment is an
attractive segment of the credit management market and that our position in both this segment and
the financial institutions segment helps support and sustain our overall stability. European overdue
trade receivables (“OTR”) stock amounted to approximately €70 billion in 2015, according to the


-----

Company Market Study. The trade segment compliments the financial institutions segment, as it offers
a relatively stable and high volume of stock with short duration. In many of the markets in which we will
operate, we believe OTR flow will remain at high levels in the short-term, driven by increased
household spending, a structural shift towards a higher proportion of invoice payments and increased
outsourcing of CMS operations. During the three years ended December 31, 2016, Intrum Justitia and
Lindorff acquired non-financial institution stock with a total collectible value on purchased debt of SEK
20 billion and €557 million, respectively, from European telecommunications, utilities and other trade
companies.

**_Europe’s most diversified credit management company_**

_Complete service offering._

In addition to having the widest European geographic footprint, we will have the market’s broadest
service offerings across the credit management value chain, including financial services, enabling us
to operate as a “one-stop shop” for our clients. Our predominant activities are in debt collection and
debt purchasing. Additionally, within our CMS service line, we offer value-added services before loans
and receivables become overdue, including information, invoice and payment services, which are an
important source of origination for the debt purchasing and debt collection businesses and for data
collection. Our broad product and service offering will be complemented by our ability to offer flexible
solutions to our clients, including by leveraging Lindorff’s market-leading capabilities in the carve-outs
of financial institutions’ in-house collection units, co-investment structures and, more recently,
provision of RES.

_Ability to acquire and service several types of loans._

Historically, Intrum Justitia and Lindorff have focused on unsecured consumer debt originated by
financial institutions and overdue trade receivables originated by the trade sector. Both companies
have also increased their activities in the secured consumer debt market segment. Lindorff further
expanded its footprint and capabilities in this market segment through the Aktua Acquisition during
2016, which also marked its entry into the Spanish RES segment.

**_Strategic balance between highly complementary CMS and Financial Services businesses_**

_Data analytics._

Our broad service offering allows us to collect data through the credit management value chain and
extract data synergies to continuously strengthen our data analytics capabilities. We consider data
analytics and business intelligence to be important in driving optimized collection strategies and
accurately and competitively pricing portfolios that we bid for. For example, over time, Intrum Justitia
has collected depersonalized data on over 177 million claims across both debt collection, within its
CMS service line, and debt purchasing, within its Financial Services service line, and estimates that it
has a data warehouse consisting of over one billion events, such as payments and actions taken,
associated with those claims.

_Operational synergies._

The combined scale we achieve through the breadth of our service offering as well as our
pan-European footprint provides us with economies of skill and scale. As an example of our scale, for
the year ended December 31, 2016, on a combined basis, we had approximately SEK 5,333 million
(€563 million equivalent) in average monthly collections (with approximately 87% in our CMS service
line). Operational synergies are important drivers of efficient operations through standardized
processes given the scalable nature of our business model. For example, Intrum Justitia’s and
Lindorff’s EBITDA margins have increased by 2 percentage points and 7 percentage points,
respectively, from the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2016.


-----

_Financial complementarity._

With our integrated and balanced business model, we also benefit from the financial complementarity
between our two service lines, whereby capital-light earnings from the CMS service line (SEK 2,012
million (€212 million equivalent) on a _pro forma combined basis for the year ended December 31,_
2016) generate cash which can be utilized for portfolio purchases and deleveraging.

**_Diversified origination platform_**

_Debt collection supports the tendering process in the debt purchasing component of our business._

When bidding for portfolios from our existing CMS clients, we are able to leverage our existing
business relationship, accurately and competitively price portfolios that we find attractive, and offer an
attractive value proposition to clients, informed by our knowledge of, and provision of other services
to, the client.

_Long-term relationships with our CMS clients._

Intrum Justitia and Lindorff both have a track record of maintaining long-term relationships with their
largest clients and have also historically achieved high levels of repeat purchases from existing
customers, which we believe evidences the strength of our product and service offerings. For Intrum
Justitia, out of its five largest clients in the CMS service line, four have had a relationship with Intrum
Justitia of more than 10 years, three have had a relationship of more than 15 years and the relationship
with Intrum Justitia’s largest client extends beyond 25 years. In the Nordic region, some of Lindorff’s
largest revenue contributors and longest relationships were established in the 1980s and, with respect
to Lindorff’s top 10 clients in each market, the average length of each client relationship in third-party
debt collection services is over nine years.

_Carve-outs with long-term contracts._

In recent years, Lindorff has completed several carve-out transactions, typically with financial
institutions, with respect to clients’ in-house collection units, including entering into long-term servicing
agreements with the financial institution. For instance, the average remaining contract life from the
recent carve-outs of Banco Sabadell (in 2014) and Banco Mare Nostrum (entered into in 2013 and
expanded in 2015), the two largest carve-out transactions entered into by Lindorff, stretches over seven
years.

_Large number of repeat and small purchases._

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2017, on a pro forma combined basis, we would have had SEK
1,055 million (€111 million equivalent) of purchases of loans and other overdue receivables under
forward flow contracts, providing visibility on new business origination. Additionally, over the same
period, Intrum Justitia had SEK 467 million of small purchases, with each portfolio less than €2 million
in size, and Lindorff had €82 million of small purchases, with each portfolio less than €5 million in size.
On a combined basis, the Company’s average purchased debt claim size would have been
approximately SEK 23,600 as of March 31, 2017.

_Significant supply of NPLs in the market._

Based on the Company Market Study, we believe that the European bank NPL stock amounted to
approximately €1.1 trillion in 2015, representing more than 2.5x the 2007 levels. Coupled with
increased regulatory pressure, based on the Company Market Study, we expect that NPL sales, as a
base case scenario, will increase by 5-8% per year between 2015-2020 and that this could increase
further should banks decide to accelerate deleveraging of their balance sheets. At the same time,
based on the Company Market Study, we expect the European bank NPL stock to remain stable at
approximately €1 trillion over the next three years, as a base case, due to increases in lending and
continued new NPL formation. See “Industry Overview—Financial institution generated debt.”


-----

_Pan-European presence, multi-sector and transaction structure capabilities._

Our pan-European presence, with operations in 23 countries, will enable us to efficiently allocate
capital to opportunities with the best risk/reward profiles. We have capabilities with respect to financial
institutions as well as across multiple trade sectors, including utilities, telecommunications and retail,
which allows flexible capital deployment in debt purchasing and enhances our ability to identify and
take advantage of trends in various sectors in the CMS service line. Furthermore, we will benefit from
Lindorff’s co-investment structure. During the course of 2015 and 2016, Lindorff participated in
co-investments in the Baltics and Spain and entered into a co-investment partnership with CarVal and
AlbaCore to allow it to swiftly capitalize on market opportunities. Pursuant to Lindorff’s co-investment
agreement with CarVal and AlbaCore, CarVal and AlbaCore, as co-investment partners, announced an
intention to deploy up to a total of €350 million in aggregate and Lindorff announced an intention to
deploy a variable amount determined on a case-by-case basis towards the acquisition of unsecured
NPL portfolios in Europe. These co-investment arrangements will provide us with the ability to acquire
larger, mixed portfolios due to risk sharing with co-investment partners and also increase the breadth
of our origination platform by leveraging the network of our co-investment partners. We expect to target
minority holdings in the range of 20-50% in debt purchasing co-investment structures, while also
providing third-party debt collection services for 100% of the portfolio. As a result, in addition to debt
purchasing revenues, such co-investment arrangements act as a capital-light growth accelerator of
third-party debt collection with a lower level of upfront capital investment.

**_Track record of continuous operational excellence, innovation and efficiency improvements_**

We will benefit from Intrum Justitia and Lindorff’s shared culture, focused on innovation and
operational improvement to drive financial performance. Intrum Justitia and Lindorff have each
undertaken a range of initiatives that historically have improved their respective collection and margins,
and that we believe will further improve the performance of our business. These include, among other
things:

- standardization: consolidated infrastructure among subsidiaries and reduced the number of
physical collection sites, virtual collection systems and IT systems;

- data management: centralized data pools and implemented data cleansing techniques and
analytical tools which support enhanced decision-making;

- digitalization: invested in self-service consumer and client portals, facilitating timely and
transparent communication and proactive management of credit management services;

- automation: deployed sales-based robotics with advanced software, capable of replicating
human activities, exploring the application of artificial intelligence to operational processes; and

- shared services: consolidated and near-shored shared services and continue to evaluate
expansion to additional service centers.

In addition, we expect to benefit from significant cost synergies following the Merger. For further details,
see “—Our Strategy—Continue to drive profitability through operational excellence and realization of
_operational synergies.”_

**_Strong embedded risk culture_**

Intrum Justitia and Lindorff benefit from well-defined and multi-layered risk management frameworks
and a rigorous approach to maintaining pricing discipline that we believe will support profitability
through active and effective management of pricing, reputational and regulatory risks throughout our
investment decision-making process. Given the breadth of Intrum Justitia’s and Lindorff’s experience
throughout the credit management value chain, we will have access to comprehensive databases of
purchased and serviced debt. Combined with data analysis capabilities, we will be able to take a
centralized approach to forecasting and pricing that is supported by specialist local input, ensuring
strong cross-organizational evaluation of portfolio pricing. Our data capabilities will also facilitate more
efficient debt collection strategies through data analytics and cross-learning. In addition, the three

-----

tiered risk management approach of Intrum Justitia and Lindorff will help ensure that this sophisticated
pricing information is used in an investment decision-making context that focuses on compliance and
maintaining strong internal controls. A focus on risk management and compliance are woven into the
structure of Intrum Justitia and Lindorff from the local level (where each of Intrum Justitia and Lindorff
has its first line of defense) to the internal and independent external risk control and auditing functions
carried out at the executive and board levels.

We believe this focus on pricing discipline and risk management has historically enabled Intrum
Justitia and Lindorff to consistently outperform their respective forecasted collections. Neither Intrum
Justitia nor Lindorff have had any negative net revaluations of their respective portfolios in the past
three years. Additionally, Intrum Justitia and Lindorff collected 106-113% and 98-113%, respectively, of
forecasted cash flows for each quarter from debt purchasing from January 1, 2014 through March 31,
2017.

**_Resilient financial performance with strong cash generation_**

_Long track record of stable revenue growth and expanding margins._

Intrum Justitia and Lindorff have each shown a stable trend of revenue growth and margin expansion.
For example, Intrum Justitia’s net revenue grew 8% per annum between December 31, 2014 through
December 31, 2016 and its EBITDA margin improved by 2 percentage points, from 33% in the year
ended December 31, 2014 to 35% in the year ended December 31, 2016. Over the same period,
Lindorff’s net revenue grew 17% per annum and its EBITDA margin improved by 7 percentage points,
from 32% to 39%. We believe there is potential for further top-line growth based on favorable market
supply dynamics and our capital deployment flexibility. Additionally, we believe our pro forma EBITDA
margin will be positively impacted by our operating leverage, ongoing cost savings initiatives and
realization of synergies associated with the Merger, including anticipated cost synergies from the
Merger estimated at SEK 560 million (€59 million equivalent) per annum after full implementation and
giving effect to the disposal of the Carveout Business and additional revenue synergies.

_Stable cash flows in CMS, with capital-light investment._

Intrum Justitia’s and Lindorff’s third-party debt collection services, which require relatively limited
investment, generate stable cash flows, supported by long-term client relationships. As of March 31,
2017, we manage, on a combined basis, third-party debt with a combined total collectible value on
third-party debt of SEK 344 billion (€36 billion equivalent). Furthermore, in connection with Lindorff’s
recent entry into several carve-out transactions, typically with financial institutions, Lindorff has entered
into long-term servicing agreements. Overall, we tend to experience strong client loyalty and limited
attrition, in part due to system integrations with clients, which can make it unattractive for clients to
switch credit management company.

_Significant cash flows embedded in portfolios of purchased debt._

As of March 31, 2017, our ERC on a combined basis would have been SEK 46,704 million
(€4,892 million equivalent). Intrum Justitia and Lindorff have a long track record of outperforming their
initial collection forecasts and extending collection periods beyond 15 years. Furthermore, we strive to
maintain an accurate valuation of the portfolios on our balance sheet and neither Intrum Justitia nor
Lindorff have had any negative net write downs of their respective portfolios in the last three years.

_Strong cash generation with efficient conversion of profit into cash flow._

For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, Intrum Justitia used SEK 143 million, SEK
135 million and SEK 142 million, respectively, of its Adjusted EBITDA (representing 4%, 4% and 5%,
respectively, of its Adjusted EBITDA) on capital expenditures other than capital expenditures related to
the purchase of debt portfolios. Over the same period and excluding the 2014 Spanish Acquisition,
Lindorff used €21 million, €45 million and €32 million, respectively, of its Adjusted EBITDA
(representing 5%, 14% and 12% respectively, of its Adjusted EBITDA) on capital expenditures other
than capital expenditures related to the purchase of debt portfolios. For the twelve months ended


-----

March 31, 2017, total investments in purchased debt by the Company on a pro forma combined basis
would have been SEK 7,026 million (€739 million equivalent). For additional information on our cash
conversion rates, see “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations of Intrum Justitia—Overview” and “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial_
_Condition and Results of Operations of Lindorff—Overview.”_

**_Proven management team with a clear strategic agenda_**

_Strong leadership of experienced senior management supported by specialist teams in central_
_functions and local markets._

We are managed by a strong executive team comprising individuals with many years of relevant
experience and providing leadership across all functional areas of the business. For example, Intrum
Justitia’s CEO and the named CEO of the Company, Mikael Ericson, was formerly Head of International
Banking at Danske Bank A/S, one of the leading banks in the Nordic region, and CEO of Carnegie
Investment Bank AB. In addition, Intrum Justitia’s CFO and the named CFO of the Company, Erik
Forsberg, has been CFO of Intrum Justitia for over five years and has previously held positions as CFO,
group treasurer and business controller at several companies. A skilled team of managers operating
our central functions and assisting in the execution of our strategy at group level supplements our
executive team. In addition, our regional and country managers bring significant industry expertise and
local input to drive execution of our strategic agenda.

**Our Strategy**

Intrum Justitia and Lindorff share similar and complementary strategic priorities. We will build on the
existing strategic priorities of the two companies and leverage their respective complementarity.

**_Maintaining and strengthening our position as the leading credit management company in_**
**_Europe and leveraging our well-balanced and integrated business model_**

We are the largest and most diversified credit management company in Europe, with a leading position
in the majority of countries in which we operate and the ability to serve clients across the full credit
management value chain and across various asset classes. We have a clear objective to remain client
centric, evolve with our clients and continue to meet their needs. Maintaining an integrated, balanced
and flexible business model is a key feature of achieving this objective.

**_Continue to drive profitability through operational excellence and realization of operational_**
**_synergies_**

We have a long history of commitment to operational excellence and track record of continuously
improving our margins and we have identified several initiatives to further drive efficiency
improvements and our profitability going forward, including:

- _Operational integration and portfolio management. We intend to deploy the best practices of_
Intrum Justitia and Lindorff across our operations. We will seek to leverage scale and skill
advantages and experience in data management, analytics and digitalization to drive collection
performance excellence across our debt purchasing and debt collection businesses. We see
strong value potential from further focus on active portfolio management.

- _Focus on pricing discipline, risk management and compliance. As a result of strict pricing_
discipline, institutionalized investment processes and operational improvements, neither Intrum
Justitia nor Lindorff have had any negative net revaluations of their respective portfolios in the
past three years. Additionally, Intrum Justitia and Lindorff have collected 106-113% and 98-113%,
respectively, of forecasted cash flows for each quarter from debt purchasing from January 1, 2014
through March 31, 2017. We intend to continue to employ a high level of underwriting discipline
in order to maintain forecasting accuracy and to ensure that we only acquire portfolios that
generate returns that meet our investment return criteria. In addition, we will seek to maintain our


-----

competitive advantage through continued early adoption of regulation and best-in-class
compliance and risk management procedures.

- _Realize operational synergies. We expect to benefit from significant cost synergies from the_
Merger that are estimated at SEK 560 million (€59 million equivalent) per annum after full
implementation and giving effect to the disposal of the Carveout Business. Management
estimates that it will take approximately three years for the full impact of the cost synergies to be
realized. A detailed assessment has been performed involving external strategy consultants and
operational staff within both Intrum Justitia and Lindorff. The assessment identified cost synergies
arising mainly from optimization of operations centers, consolidation of administrative and
support functions, harmonization of IT systems and application development/maintenance, and
increased scale in procurement. These estimates reflect the proposed divestment of the Carveout
Business and consequently differ from the estimated cost synergies that have been previously
announced. Cost synergy implementation costs are estimated at approximately SEK 725 million
(€76 million equivalent), the majority of which are expected to be incurred in the first two years
following the closing of the Merger. In addition to cost synergies, the assessment also identified
certain revenue synergies from the combination of business intelligence operations and data sets,
cross-selling of complementary offerings to existing clients, improved cross-border coverage of
international clients and transfer of best practices.

**_Continue balanced growth in areas of expertise_**

We believe that we are well-positioned for balanced and diversified growth across asset classes and
sectors, based on our integrated and balanced business model. Key features of our balanced growth
strategy include:

- _Continued focus on acquisitions of unsecured NPLs. Unsecured consumer NPL sales volumes_
have increased in recent years as banks increasingly prefer selling debt to clean up their balance
sheets and to focus on their core business, and increasingly trust debt collection agencies to
handle their debt. Based on the Company Market Study, we expect this trend to continue and
estimate that annual unsecured NPL sales in Europe will grow from €3.3 billion in 2015 to an
average annual level of €3.7 billion for the period between 2017 and 2020. We will continue to
deploy capital within the unsecured NPL space.

- _Expansion in secured NPLs and real estate services. Secured NPLs represent a large portion of_
the NPL market. The acquisition of Aktua, one of the leading credit management companies in
the secured NPL segment in Spain, in June 2016 significantly strengthened our secured
consumer capabilities and added RES capabilities to our service offering. We see growth
potential from leveraging and exporting Aktua’s capabilities in secured and RES markets across
many of the geographies in which we operate.

- _Co-investments. In the debt purchasing segment, we see a pipeline in terms of the number and_
the size of investment opportunities available, which may outpace our on-balance sheet
investment appetite. We will consider flexible capital deployment initiatives, such as
co-investment structures, which will provide us with the ability to acquire larger, mixed portfolios
due to risk sharing with co-investment partners. Co-investments also increase the breadth of our
origination platform by leveraging the network of our co-investment partners. We aim to leverage
Lindorff’s experience in co-investments and continue to use co-investment structures to increase
our operating leverage.

- _Geographic expansion. We have a strong track record of expansion into new markets and have_
established operations in 23 countries. Over the last few years, Intrum Justitia and Lindorff have
each entered into new geographies through strategic transactions, including carve-outs and
bolt-on acquisitions. Going forward, we will continue to proactively evaluate opportunities to enter
new markets. For example, in April 2017, Intrum Justitia acquired Top Factoring SRL, a purchased
debt company in Romania. When entering new markets, our strategy is based on a cautious first
entry: we start small and increase our investments as our insight and experience in a particular


-----

market increases. Moreover, we often strengthen our local knowledge and databases through
business acquisitions and/or carve-out transactions (as we have previously done in the United
Kingdom, Spain, Poland and Italy). For example, one method we employ to enter a new market
involves acquiring a company with existing debt servicing capabilities and data, operating the
company to develop further knowledge and data capabilities and then leveraging this data and
market knowledge to price and purchase debt in the newly entered market.

- _SME. We believe small and midsized enterprises represent an attractive debt collection services_
client segment, and we aim to increase our presence in this market through both organic growth
in the markets in which we offer these services and through acquisitions. To that end, Intrum
Justitia acquired a company in Denmark and a company in Spain that focus on SME debt
collection during the fourth quarter of 2016.

**_Commitment to highest ethical standards and fair collection practices_**

We are dependent upon relationships characterized by trust with clients, authorities and society as a
whole. In order to achieve the necessary level of trust, we must act with professionalism, expertise and
high ethical standards at all levels of our operations. Our internal standards are applicable to all
employees. These standards mandate that all employees are expected to always work within the law,
have sound moral principles and behave in an upstanding and sincere way. We have implemented a
centrally coordinated compliance monitoring program, which evaluates and assesses compliance with
legal, regulatory and industry best practices, as well as our internal standards. The continued
commitment to the highest ethical and fair collection practices is paramount to our ability to be the
leading credit management company in Europe.

**_Medium-term target_**

In the medium-term, we aim to achieve net debt in relation to Adjusted EBITDA (excluding NRIs) of
approximately 3.0 times. In preparing this medium-term target, we have in general assumed that there
will be no material changes in existing political, legal, fiscal, market or economic conditions or in
applicable legislation, regulations or rules (including, but not limited to, accounting policies and
accounting treatments), which, individually or in the aggregate, would be material to our results of
operations; and that we will not become party to any litigation or administrative proceeding that might
have a material impact on us of which we are currently unaware. Our actual results could differ
materially from this target as a result of many factors, including, but not limited to, those described
under “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.”

**Intrum Justitia: History**

Intrum Justitia has its origins in 1923 when Sven Göranson founded Justitia Upplysningsbyrå AB in
Sweden. Following World War I, the European economy was rebuilding and companies were
encountering difficulties with getting paid on time or securing payment from their customers at all.
Justitia Upplysningsbyrå AB became a pioneer in the development of a solution through obtaining
credit information prior to lending and undertaking collection operations. In 1937, Sven Göranson sold
Justitia Upplysningsbyrå AB and founded Justitias Inkasso och Juridiska byrå AB, a company focused
on specialized collection operations. From the end of World War II through the 1960s, Europe again
experienced economic growth and there was an upswing in purchasing on credit. During this period,
Justitia Inkasso och Juridiska byrå AB became Sweden’s dominant collection agency. The company
expanded both organically and through acquisitions, and in the 1980s its service offering expanded to
include a comprehensive range of services for credit administration. In 1982, the company changed its
name to Intrum Justitia AB (publ) and conducted operations in collection, financial and administrative
services and factoring.

Since the 1990s, Intrum Justitia has expanded, through acquisitions and organic growth, to become
one of Europe’s leading credit management companies. Intrum Justitia’s shares have been listed on
Nasdaq Stockholm since June 2002 and have been listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm Large Cap list
since January 2014. For the periods under review, and excluding the Merger, Intrum Justitia has carried


-----

out ten major acquisitions to complement its established operations. In 2015, Intrum Justitia expanded
its offering with the launch of flexible financing solutions for e-trade through the brands Avarda in the
Nordic region and Byjuno in Switzerland. Historically, Intrum Justitia has primarily invested in
unsecured consumer debt. In 2016, it increased its scope of investing in purchased receivables within
new asset classes, primarily in secured claims, through the acquisition of a large portfolio from Erste
Bank Hungary, consisting of consumer loans with real estate collateral. On February 14, 2017, Intrum
Justitia completed the acquisition of 1st Credit, representing its re-entry into the UK market. As of
March 31, 2017, Intrum Justitia has approximately 75,000 clients and approximately 4,300 employees.
Intrum Justitia has operations in 21 countries.

**Intrum Justitia: Operations and Service Offerings**

Intrum Justitia divides its operations along two service lines: (i) CMS, through which Intrum Justitia
offers services along the credit management value chain, from credit optimization and payment
services to debt collection; and, (ii) Financial Services, which includes factoring, payment guarantees,
payment solutions for e-commerce companies and purchased debt services. Intrum Justitia’s
comprehensive service offering and size supports its ability to develop strong customer relationships
and collect data that it analyzes to gain further insight into consumer behavior. The depth and breadth
of Intrum Justitia’s data assets and analytical capability is key to promoting growth in each component
of Intrum Justitia’s business. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, CMS accounted for 51% of
consolidated total revenues and Financial Services accounted for 49% of consolidated total revenues.

The table below sets forth Intrum Justitia’s revenue by service line for the periods indicated.

(1)  Inter-service line revenue.

**_CMS_**

Intrum Justitia offers services to meet the needs of its clients throughout the credit management chain,
from the assessment of credit to payment and collection, to varying degrees depending on the
particular country. Collection services generate the greatest proportion of revenue for this service line.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, collection services accounted for 87% of credit management
revenue. Intrum Justitia’s other offerings in its CMS division include credit information and optimization
services, and payment services.

_Collection services_

Where invoices are past due, Intrum Justitia offers debt collection services, which are the primary
source of revenue for the CMS service line. Intrum Justitia has an aggregate total collectible value on
third-party debt of SEK 154,149 million as of March 31, 2017. Intrum Justitia undertakes the same debt
collection process for its own portfolios as it does for the overdue receivables of its clients, subject to
any guidelines set by clients regarding settlement and specific procedures to utilize. Actions taken
during the debt collection process take into account applicable country-specific laws and regulations
and aim to preserve clients’ reputations.

In the initial stages of the debt collection process, Intrum Justitia uses Scoring to predict the likelihood
that a customer will pay and to tailor its debt collection strategies to conduct the process of collecting
the final payment from end-customers. The process is tailor-made to account for certain circumstances


-----

and behaviors so as to minimize the impact on the customer relationship. Typically, customers are sent
a letter stating that Intrum Justitia has been instructed to collect the claim on the client’s behalf. If the
customer does not pay within a prescribed period, Intrum Justitia employs tailor-made strategies
aimed at ensuring collection. Collection methods include telephone calls, letters, text messages,
emails, and, to some extent, personal visits by agents. Via its online tool, IntrumWeb, Intrum Justitia
provides visibility for its clients on the amount a client’s organization is owed and the payment status
in real-time.

Intrum Justitia is capable of providing international collection services in approximately 180 countries
to companies engaging in international trade. These services are delivered through Intrum Justitia’s
own network of offices and through Intrum Justitia’s network of selected partners, depending on the
location of the end-customer. International collections are offered to companies operating in Intrum
Justitia’s own markets, as well as to companies located elsewhere. Intrum Justitia’s network contains
partners selected through a structured on-boarding process and termination plan. Partners are
continuously monitored to ensure they meet Intrum Justitia’s code of conduct.

If the amicable collection process is unsuccessful, despite the end-customer receiving assistance from
Intrum Justitia and an opportunity to pay, the matter may be forwarded to legal authorities for a
decision. The legal systems vary between countries depending on, for instance, the applicable
legislation and the local legal entities responsible for handling the cases. Intrum Justitia has
established locally-adapted processes using highly skilled staff, which may involve third parties where
required, such as courts, attorneys and bailiffs.

_Payment services_

Intrum Justitia provides a full suite of services relating to accounts receivable, including invoicing and
reminder services. Invoices are distributed automatically and, in circumstances where customers do
not pay their bills, Intrum Justitia offers reminder services. Using its IT capabilities and Scoring, Intrum
Justitia is able to send individually-adapted reminders to those who have fallen behind with their
payments. Intrum Justitia’s database on people’s payment patterns and payment trends enables it to
adapt the design and frequency of payment reminders to take account of the end-customer’s finances
and thereby help to maintain strong relationships between the customer and the client. If a client
wishes to send its own invoices, Intrum Justitia also offers a tailored account ledger service to support
clients in completing transactions with their customers.

Intrum Justitia further offers VAT services, whereby it acts as an external VAT specialist and is
responsible for the client’s VAT refund process. It also offers VAT consultancy, registration and
compliance services, as well as tailored training packages on how to deal with VAT issues.

_Credit information and optimization services_

Intrum Justitia provides credit information on individuals and companies across Europe to help its
clients determine who to sell to and on what terms. As business is increasingly conducted online, a
greater amount is paid for through credit solutions such as invoicing or different installment models.
Intrum Justitia’s integrated services help its clients prevent late or non-payment. Intrum Justitia shares
its insight into existing and prospective consumers’ payment patterns so that clients can make credit
decisions on the basis of efficient and reliable information on the creditworthiness of their consumers
to help ensure a successful transaction and so that consumers make transactions for which they have
the capacity to pay.

Credit risk analysis is based on a process Intrum Justitia has termed “scoring,” pursuant to which
Intrum Justitia estimates the creditworthiness of a group of consumers based on historical data and
anticipates their payment habits and behaviors (“Scoring”). Scoring requires advanced statistical tools
and considerable IT capacity. The overall credit risk assessment is derived from a combination of
Scoring and an understanding of human behavior, payment patterns and the market. Intrum Justitia
therefore benefits from its long-term experience of European credit markets and its database of
payment patterns in different markets.


-----

Intrum Justitia also offers a monitoring service pursuant to which it monitors the performance of a
client’s credit agreements and detects and alerts the client of changes that could affect their credit risk
and that may need action. This service helps clients avoid the possibility of a non-payment in the
future.

**_Financial Services_**

Intrum Justitia offers a range of financial services, including factoring (to a limited extent), e-commerce
services and purchase of portfolios of loans and other overdue receivables. The revenue generated
from returns on purchased portfolios is the primary source of revenue for this service line. For the year
ended December 31, 2016, revenue from portfolios accounted for 97% of Financial Services revenue.

_E-commerce services_

Intrum Justitia offers e-commerce operators a service whereby: (i) Intrum Justitia evaluates in real-time
the potential end-customer of the e-commerce operator; (ii) if the assessment is positive, Intrum
Justitia offers the end-customer, on behalf of the client, the option to provide payment by installments;
and (iii) Intrum Justitia produces the invoices and ensures timely payment. Although Intrum Justitia
conducts the entire process, all communications to the end-client come from the e-commerce
operator, thereby strengthening its brand and, accordingly, its competitiveness. Where the
e-commerce operator elects, Intrum Justitia may pay the e-commerce operator the full amount
immediately and assume the remaining credit risk and responsibility for the collection process. The
price to be paid by the client to Intrum Justitia for its assumption of the risk is negotiated on a caseby-case basis depending on the product type and the level of risk assumed. Intrum Justitia currently
offers e-commerce services in Switzerland, as well as in Sweden and Finland through Avarda AB, its
joint venture with TF Bank in which Intrum Justitia holds a 49% interest, with an option to acquire the
remaining 51% interest from TF Bank in 2020. Following the Merger, we plan to continue to grow and
expand its e-commerce offering into its other geographical markets.

_Purchase of overdue receivables_

Following a thorough risk analysis assessment, Intrum Justitia acquires portfolios of loans and other
overdue receivables for a portion of the nominal value, with the percentage depending on the quality
of the debt. Intrum Justitia then services the debt independently using its in-house debt collection
function, thereby benefiting from its expertise and economies of scale. Intrum Justitia maintains pricing
discipline through an institutionalized investment process and a structurally embedded risk
management culture, supported by data analytics, which enables it to maintain high portfolio returns
and mitigate the risk of overbidding on portfolios. Intrum Justitia buys written-off debt from nearly every
type and size of company, including credit institutions, private and public enterprises, and government
bodies, though it focuses on acquiring portfolios from known clients. Intrum Justitia’s provision of
CMS, and the complementarity between collection services and debt purchasing, places it in a strong
position when seeking to purchase portfolios. In addition to benefiting from advantages related to
scale, particularly in relation to data analytics and operational efficiencies, Intrum Justitia has a greater
understanding of portfolios being acquired in circumstances where it previously serviced the relevant
debt and can therefore assess and price offered portfolios more accurately. We believe Intrum Justitia’s
full service offering and established relationships make it an attractive bidder for debt portfolios. For
the year ended December 31, 2016, 74% of Intrum Justitia’s purchased debt was from existing or
previous clients.

Intrum Justitia’s core focus has been on portfolios containing consumer unsecured debt and it seeks
to maintain diversified portfolios, by country and industry, helping to limit overall volatility. During 2016,
Intrum Justitia increased the scope of its investments in purchased receivables within new adjacent
asset classes by acquiring its first major secured portfolio. In October 2016, Intrum Justitia acquired a
large portfolio from Erste Bank of Hungary, consisting of past-due consumer loans secured by real
estate. Intrum Justitia also increased the scope of its debt collection services for receivables with SMEs
through business acquisitions, such as the acquisition of Segestión Gabinete Tecnico Empresarial, SL
in Spain and Dansk Kreditorservice A/S in Denmark, each during the fourth quarter of 2016. We believe


-----

that the provision of debt collection services improves Intrum Justitia’s ability to participate in tenders
and make sound investment decisions with respect to portfolios of SME receivables.

Intrum Justitia also increased the scope of its investments in receivables of SMEs through corporate
acquisitions, such as the acquisitions of Segestión, Coface and DKS.

Intrum Justitia spent SEK 497 million, SEK 687 million and SEK 620 million of the amount spent on
portfolio purchases in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 on forward flow
arrangements. Intrum Justitia believes that forward flow agreements are beneficial as they provide
certainty of a minimum volume of claims on which to perform debt collection. Similarly, these
agreements are beneficial to the seller as they provide a certain level of predictability of the volume of
claims being sold.

**Intrum Justitia: Business Intelligence**

The characteristics of the credit management and financial services markets provide a competitive
advantage to participants with the strongest data assets and analytical capabilities. Intrum Justitia’s
database of businesses and credit information on markets, consumer groups and companies provides
the basis for assessing credit risk, offering individually tailored payment plans, collecting on overdue
debt, offering e-commerce services and valuing overdue receivables. Each of these services helps to
ensure that Intrum Justitia’s clients get paid and their customers become debt-free.

Intrum Justitia believes that its data assets and analytical capabilities enable it to proactively assess
portfolios and that these capabilities will be further enhanced by the Merger. For a description of
Lindorff’s data assets, see “—Lindorff: Business Intelligence.” Companies that only purchase portfolios
typically have less data on customers and associated payment trends until a portfolio is purchased,
when the specific customers in the portfolio can be matched to a credit referencing agency database.
In addition, customer files in a portfolio may contain inaccurate or incomplete information on the name,
address or telephone number of the customer, which can make it difficult to locate the customer or
otherwise complicate the debt collection process. For competitors that do not have experience in debt
collection, this may result in data asymmetry in valuing portfolios prior to purchase and through the
collection process.

**Intrum Justitia: Geographic Presence**

As of March 31, 2017, Intrum Justitia had operations in 21 countries, divided into three regions:
Northern Europe (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Sweden), Central
Europe (Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Slovakia and Switzerland) and Western
Europe (Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the UK). On April 19, 2017, Intrum Justitia
additionally acquired a presence in Romania.

To address competition concerns raised by the European Commission following its investigation of the
Merger, Nordic Capital has committed to divesting the Carveout Business. Intrum Justitia’s distribution
of revenue by geographic region may be significantly affected by divestment of the Carveout Business.
See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Divestment of the Carveout Business,”
_“Summary—The Transactions—The Merger,” “Summary—Divestment of the Carveout Business” and_
_“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions—We may not be able to divest the Carveout Business_
_in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, at a reasonable price or at all.”_

Intrum Justitia has selectively pursued potential acquisitions and carve-out transactions to expand its
geographic footprint. For further information on its historical expansion, see “—Intrum Justitia: History.”
Additionally, Intrum Justitia works closely with trusted agents around the world to perform international
debt collection. It has partnerships with representatives in approximately 180 countries to assist clients
with operations both within Europe and beyond.

**Intrum Justitia: Clients**

Intrum Justitia has approximately 75,000 clients, operating in virtually all sectors, though with a focus
on telecommunications companies, energy, financial institutions and companies in the retail sector. For
the year ended December 31, 2016, Intrum Justitia’s 20 largest clients accounted for 15% of its
revenues. While Intrum Justitia is particularly strong among clients with large volumes of consumer
receivables, it also works with thousands of small, entrepreneurial companies and medium-sized
companies that have chosen to focus on their core operations rather than on credit management.

**Intrum Justitia: Material Contracts**

**_Acquisitions_**

_Top Factoring SRL_

In April 2017, Intrum Justitia acquired Top Factoring SRL, one of the leading companies for purchased
debt in Romania. The acquisition price was €25.7 million, the majority of which was attributed to a
portfolio of overdue receivables held by Top Factoring SRL’s parent company.

_IJCOF Corporate SAS_

In April 2017, Intrum Justitia SAS acquired the remaining 42% of the shares in IJCOF Corporate SAS
for €8.9 million, after having acquired a 58% stake in December 2013. IJCOF Corporate SAS provides
corporate collection operations in France.

_1st Credit_

In February 2017, Intrum Justitia completed its acquisition of the entire share capital of 1st Credit, a UK
company offering debt collection services. The purchase price on a cash and debt free basis was
£130 million, attributable to a diversified portfolio of receivables, deriving from investments from several
sellers in the financial industry.

**Intrum Justitia: Compliance and Quality Control**

Intrum Justitia views the effective monitoring and management of significant risks, including
investment risk, to be critical to protecting its reputation and value. Within the Intrum Justitia risk
management framework, all Intrum Justitia employees assume responsibility for managing the
economic, reputational and compliance risks faced by the company as part of their regular work
duties. In addition, Intrum Justitia’s risk management and compliance approach involves an
independent external risk control function that serves as both an active participant in important


-----

transactional processes, a monitor in connection with the auditing of risk management and compliance
activities and a strategic advisor in connection with establishing Intrum Justitia’s risk appetite and
compliance policies.

The Chief Risk Officer is the executive responsible for managing our risk management and compliance
programs, and the Chief Risk Officer reports directly to Intrum Justitia’s President and has direct
access to its board.

**Intrum Justitia: Employees, Recruiting and Training**

As of March 31, 2017, Intrum Justitia had approximately 4,300 FTEs. The majority of its employees are
actively involved in providing service to its CMS clients and claims management for its purchased debt.
With the objective of attracting, developing and retaining talented employees, Intrum Justitia employs
tools aimed at enhancing expertise and leadership capacity among employees and managers. For
example, in 2016 nearly 50 managers completed Intrum Justitia’s leadership program, designed in
collaboration with SSE Executive Education at the Stockholm School of Economics.

The table below sets forth the average number of FTEs, including temporary employees, Intrum Justitia
had in each of its local operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014,
respectively.

selling to address competition concerns raised by the European Commission. See “Summary—Divestment of the Carveout
_Business.”_

Intrum Justitia believes that it has positive relations with its employees and the applicable unions and
work councils. Some of its employees are unionized. Intrum Justitia meets with the unions and work
councils on an annual basis to update them on the direction of the business and to address any
concerns that they may have.

**Intrum Justitia: Legal and Administrative Proceedings**

As Intrum Justitia has expansive operations across several jurisdictions, it is frequently subject to
disputes, claims and administrative proceedings, many of which arise in the ordinary course of
business. These can include disputes regarding VAT, interest cost deductions, intra-group loan pricing
or a variety of other matters, particularly relating to tax. Other than as discussed below, Intrum Justitia
has not been party to any governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings (including any such
proceedings which are pending or threatened of which it is aware) during the previous 12 months from
the date of this Offering Memorandum which may have, or have had in the recent past, significant
effects on Intrum Justitia’s financial position or profitability.

Intrum Justitia is currently party to a number of disputes in the Netherlands. The first set of disputes
relate to a recent Dutch Supreme Court decision holding that telecom consumers who are party to an
agreement in which a “free” phone is provided are protected by laws and regulations relating to
payment by instalments and consumer credit. As a result, such agreements are null, wholly or partially.
Intrum Justitia entered into agreements with Vodafone and T-Mobile affected by this ruling with respect
to the sale and assignment of certain claims. Vodafone demands payment for outstanding invoices.
Intrum Justitia asserts, however, that Vodafone is not entitled to that amount, as the amount partially
relates to contracts between the companies and their customers that have no legal consequence due
to the ruling by the Dutch Supreme Court. Intrum Justitia also counterclaims that Vodafone has been
unjustly enriched by receipt of prior payments under the contract. Vodafone’s claim against Intrum
Justitia is valued at approximately €6.8 million and Intrum Justitia’s counterclaim is likely to exceed
€10 million. The parties have agreed to submit their dispute to arbitration, which has begun and is in
the preliminary stages. Intrum Justitia may file a civil action against T-Mobile for approximately €5
million and T-Mobile’s counterclaim is expected to be in excess of €1.4 million.

Intrum Justitia is also party to disputes relating to the acquisition and management of Buckaroo BV. In
January 2012, Intrum Justitia, through its Dutch subsidiary, acquired Buckaroo from its former
shareholders. After certain unlawful behavior was detected, Intrum Justitia replaced Buckaroo BV’s
management and became subject to a number of proceedings relating to earn-out provisions. While
some claims brought by certain former shareholders and management have been dismissed and there
is no further opportunity to appeal, two other claims brought by former shareholders have been
dismissed but the parties still have the opportunity to file an appeal. A risk remains that the former
shareholders will continue to claim payment pursuant to earn-out provisions that may entitle them to
an aggregate of €28 million. There is also an ongoing dispute between a former shareholder and the
legal entity that manages the third party funds of Buckaroo BV over a payment of €450,000.

We are also aware of one open tax audit. The Swiss tax authorities have asked Intrum Justitia Debt
Finance AG, a Swiss subsidiary, to reply to various questions relating to stamp duties reported for the
past few years. No claims have thus far been made by the Swiss tax authorities. Intrum Justitia also
receives inquiries from various regulators across the several jurisdictions in which it operates.

**Intrum Justitia: Insurance**

We maintain comprehensive insurance policies with respect to, among other things, business
interruptions, professional indemnity, directors’ and officers’ liability and property damage. We believe
that our insurance coverage is in accordance with that of other similar companies and is adequate for
our needs.

**Intrum Justitia: Real Property**

Intrum Justitia’s headquarters is located in Stockholm, Sweden but it coordinates local operations
within each of the countries in which it offers services through properties located in these countries. It
leases its headquarters and primarily leases the other properties from which it services are offered.

**Intrum Justitia: Intellectual Property**

While Intrum Justitia holds various trademarks and has registered several domain names, no individual
or series of trademarks or intellectual property is material to its business as a whole.

**Intrum Justitia: Sustainability and Social Responsibility**

**_Promote a Sound Economy_**

Intrum Justitia’s objective is to create the conditions for a sound economy. When credit assessments
and payment flows functions as they should, companies are paid. This allows companies to be more
profitable, to develop, grow and recruit more employees. At the same time, Intrum Justitia helps people
become debt-free and to achieve sound private finances. Intrum Justitia is also environmentally and
socially conscious, and it is in helping others achieve a sound economic situation, which in turn is a
fundamental element of society’s overall sustainability efforts, that Intrum Justitia can make its greatest
impact.

Intrum Justitia has taken a number of concrete steps towards this goal. For example, over the years
Intrum Justitia has taken an active role in policy development by frequent lobbying in Brussels.
Additionally, since 1998, Intrum Justitia has conducted Europe’s largest survey on payment habits and
commissioned written reports thereon. The most recent report demonstrated the need for countries,
governments, businesses and consumers to establish efficient payment flows throughout Europe. In
general, Intrum Justitia endeavors to improve consumer skills in private finance by helping consumers
understand the importance of spending responsibly and the risks associated with high indebtedness.
Intrum Justitia is committed to providing the greatest possible benefits for clients through offering a
comprehensive range of services.

**_Education_**

Intrum Justitia educates consumers on how credit and defaults affect the individual. Since 1998, Intrum
Justitia has conducted an annual study of payment behaviors in Europe, the results of which it
disseminates through two annual reports: the European Payment Report and the European Consumer
Payment Report. These reports provide information on the effects of late payments on companies and
what European consumers’ everyday finances look like. For example, Intrum Justitia reported in the
2016 European Payment Report that its surveys show 46% of companies reported having liquidity
problems due to late payments. Of the companies surveyed, 25% say that late payments cause them
to consider dismissing staff and 33% say that late payments mean they do not dare recruit more
employees. Data from the reports is used by clients, decision-makers at the EU and local levels, and
media. The surveys provide guidance for the European Commission in developing and evaluating the
EU directive on late payments and Intrum Justitia was the only commercial actor invited to participate
in the European Commission’s effort to implement the directive in 2013 and 2014.

Intrum Justitia has also undertaken a number of initiatives at the local level. In 2016, it launched
Spendido in Sweden, an interactive web lesson on the household economy, with a focus on credit. The
lesson constitutes a tool for high school teachers to illuminate the consequences of buying on credit.
Within this framework, Intrum Justitia employees hold lessons in upper secondary school classes
about what buying credit entails, what the cost is when someone fails to pay, and what happens once
an invoice has been passed on for debt collection. The project has been extended to other countries
and there are ongoing or planned education initiatives in countries including Ireland, France, Poland
and Germany.

**_The Global Compact: UN Ten Principles for Sustainable Enterprises_**

In April 2016, Intrum Justitia signed the United Nations (“UN”) Global Compact, the ten principles for
sustainable enterprise developed by the UN. Signing the Global Compact means that Intrum Justitia
voluntarily commits to: (a) conducting its operations in a responsible manner, in line with the ten
principles of sustainability; (b) taking steps to support the communities in which it operates;
(c) establishing commitment at the highest level (the board of directors and senior management) in the
company and making sustainability work part of the company’s DNA; (d) preparing an annual report


-----

on its progress; and (e) engaging the company in sustainability issues locally. Intrum Justitia submitted
its first report to the UN in April 2017.

**_Environmental Sustainability_**

In comparison to manufacturing companies, for example, Intrum Justitia’s operations have only a
limited environmental impact. Nonetheless, it makes efforts to directly benefit the environment by
preferring video meetings to travel, owning a vehicle fleet consisting of cars that emit less than
130 grams of carbon dioxide in accordance with emissions directives from the EU, and using office
materials efficiently.

**Lindorff: History**

Lindorff was founded in 1898 in Norway by Eynar Lindorff. From its origins in Norway, it has grown to
become of the leading credit management providers in Europe. In 2003, Altor Fund acquired and
merged Lindorff Holding AS and Contant Oy, a Finnish debt collection company, to create Lindorff
Group AB, the largest credit management company in the Nordic region at the time. Until 2008,
Lindorff was owned by Altor Fund, together with certain other shareholders and management persons.
In 2008, Altor Fund and Investor became the sole equal shareholders of Lindorff. In October 2014,
Nordic Capital acquired 85% of Lindorff, with Altor Fund and Investor retaining minority shareholdings
of approximately six and eight per cent, respectively. In mid-2015, Nordic Capital purchased Altor
Fund’s remaining shares, increasing Nordic Capital’s ownership of Lindorff to 91%, and Investor
divested its minority shareholding to Coller Partners.

Lindorff solely operated in Norway until 1998, after which it expanded into other Nordic and Baltic countries.
Since 2005, Lindorff has undergone significant European expansion, both organically and through
acquisitions. For example, in March 2012, Lindorff completed a carve-out transaction involving the collection
unit of a major European financial institution, concurrently entered into a debt collection contract with that
same financial institution, and announced a major investment in portfolios held by a separate major
European financial institution. In January 2011 and December 2012, Lindorff acquired debt collection
companies from two different major European financial institutions. In November 2013 and December 2014,
it completed carve-out transactions with respect to two collection business units from two major Spanish
financial institutions and entered into long-term service agreements with these institutions, which contributed
to making Spain one of its key regions. In July, August and September 2014, it entered the Italian market
through the purchase of portfolios in Italy and has since established a firm presence there. In August 2015,
it entered the Polish market through the acquisition of Casus Finanse SA, a leading credit management
company. In June 2016, it completed the Aktua Acquisition, which, in addition to strengthening its position
as a leading pan-European credit management company, significantly strengthened its secured loans
operations and marked its entrance into RES. We believe that these transactions have helped Lindorff to
solidify its long-term relationships with major European institutions who are existing clients and have helped
it build relationships with other major European institutions. For more details about Lindorff’s acquisitions,
carve-out transactions and geographic expansion during the periods under review, see “Management
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Lindorff—Key Factors Affecting_
_Lindorff’s Results of Operations—Acquisitions and Geographic Expansion.”_

**Lindorff: Operations and Service Offerings**

Lindorff has a full service offering throughout the credit management value chain, consisting of
information, invoicing and payment, services, debt collection and debt purchasing. We believe that its
service offering meets the needs of a broad range of clients. For example, some clients do not have the
scale to efficiently or effectively perform certain functions in-house and so require Lindorff’s services both
before and after debt or receivables become due. Other clients have significant incentives to outsource
their debt collection or sell their portfolios of overdue loans and other overdue receivables, due to
changes in regulatory regimes and/or a desire to sharpen their focus on their core businesses.

**_Debt Collection_**

_Overview_

Lindorff collects overdue loans and other overdue receivables for its clients and specializes in
engineering and implementing tailored collection strategies and sustainable, affordable solutions for
the resolution of claims. Lindorff has an aggregate total collectible value on third-party debt of
€24 billion, including RES, as of March 31, 2017. Lindorff’s highly trained staff works directly to collect
debt where it has local operations, and works closely with a trusted network of debt collection partners
in countries where it does not have local staff or when end-customers move abroad to a country where
Lindorff does not have local operations.

We believe Lindorff’s clients benefit from: (a) lower collection costs, due to Lindorff’s large scale and
automation of the debt collection process; and (b) increased recovery rates, due to a combination of
Lindorff’s comprehensive databases and thorough understanding of each local market where it
operates, which together enable Lindorff to optimally tailor debt collection strategies.

_Real Estate Servicing and Secured Loans_

In June 2016, Lindorff completed the Aktua Acquisition. In addition to strengthening its position as a
leading pan-European credit management company, the Aktua Acquisition significantly strengthened
its secured loans operations and marked its entrance into RES. Secured NPLs is the largest portion of
the NPL market and therefore presents a significant market opportunity given Lindorff’s historical focus
on the unsecured segment. The new RES capabilities involve servicing, maintenance and sale of real
estate owned by its clients (i.e., not recorded on the balance sheet of Lindorff). RES is an adjacent,
and complementary, service along the credit management value chain. Currently, Lindorff has secured
loans capabilities in several of its markets and its RES capabilities are, for now, mostly limited to Spain.

_Debt Collection Process_

Lindorff’s debt collection process is standardized and automated, with the goal of maximizing the total
amount collected over the life of the debt through sustainable payment plans or affordable settlements
achieved through an amicable and solution-oriented collection approach, rather than exploiting shortterm collection potential.

Lindorff undertakes the same debt collection process for its own portfolios as it does for the overdue
receivables of its clients, subject to any guidelines set by clients regarding settlement and specific
procedures to utilize. Actions taken during the debt collection process take into account applicable
country-specific laws and regulations and aim to preserve clients’ reputations.

Lindorff’s client-centric focus is evident in its approach to fee arrangements. During certain phases of
debt collection, Lindorff works on a “no cure no pay” basis at fixed rates, which means that it only gets
paid if it is successful in collecting the relevant debt. In other phases, it typically works on a
commission basis, taking a percentage of the cash collected from the end-customer. Additionally,


-----

Lindorff also offers a profit-sharing model, where it charges commissions on collections received up to
a certain threshold and, in addition, the client shares with Lindorff a percentage of collections received
over that agreed threshold.

Lindorff has integrated several automated processes into its debt collection process to improve
efficiency and reduce the need for manual case handling. These processes include:

- _Standardized work processes: a sequence of predefined actions to occur according to a set_
schedule. Standardized processes determine when Lindorff’s agents should telephone, send out
a letter to, text message or use another means to contact the customer.

- _Campaigns: the implementation of common processes for a group of claims. Campaigns will_
typically begin when Lindorff expects customers to have an enhanced ability to pay.

- _Event engines: software driven processes that prescribe a series of actions to be taken in_
connection with 65 different external events, such as customer bankruptcy, death or address
modification. For example, these actions could include periodic telephone calls, text messages
and other methods typically utilized in the pre-legal collection process.

- _Robotics: robotics refers to the automation of business processes through the use of advanced_
software. It is effectively a virtual workforce that can carry out processes significantly faster than
humans, including selecting which customers to contact based on certain criteria and gathering
information and business intelligence across channels. Lindorff has been conducting robotics
pilot runs in Norway and Finland and has experienced considerable reductions in average
handling times in a number of its processes.

- _Lindorff 24: Lindorff 24 is an online, self-service customer solution available to customers in each_
of the countries in which Lindorff operates. Lindorff 24 maximizes transparency and accessibility
by providing customers with 24/7 access to their accounts and a means through which they can
update their contact information, review their outstanding payments, and directly proceed with
payments on their own without the need of interacting with a Lindorff representative. For many
customers this is the preferred way of handling their payments and the number of customer visits
and number of payments received via Lindorff 24 have displayed strong growth since the launch
of the platform in 2015, from approximately 9,600 payments and approximately 35,000 portal
visits in September 2015 to approximately 14,000 payments and approximately 79,000 portal
visits in March 2017.

**_Debt Purchasing_**

_Overview_

Lindorff has extensive experience in acquiring portfolios of overdue loans and other overdue receivables
at an attractive price. Among the investment criteria that it currently considers when deciding whether to
purchase a portfolio is the portfolio’s expected return and whether it matches Lindorff’s strict pricing
discipline to maintain high portfolio returns and avoid overbidding. Lindorff generates revenue after
purchasing portfolios by extracting stable long-term returns by agreeing to one-off payments, together
with sustainable payment plans over the lifetime of the debt. We believe that Lindorff can generate
attractive yields over a longer period of time than its competitors, sometimes in excess of 15 years, due
to its expertise in pricing unsecured consumer NPLs, knowledge of the portfolios it purchases and its
debt collection abilities. As Lindorff increases its focus on certain assets, such as portfolios of secured
loans which tend to be larger than portfolios of unsecured loans, it seeks to maintain investment
discipline by utilizing its institutionalized investment processes and by primarily considering such
purchases in the context of co-investment structures, as described below in “—Co-Investment.”

We believe that one of Lindorff’s core strengths is that it typically services the portfolios it purchases
in-house. In this way, Lindorff controls the entire debt collection process, is able to implement optimal
debt collection strategies and can ensure that customers are treated fairly and with respect. We believe
that the efficient, fair and respectful manner in which Lindorff conducts its business upon purchasing
a portfolio is evident through its many long-standing client relationships.


-----

As of March 31, 2017, Lindorff owned portfolios of overdue loans and other overdue receivables,
consisting of approximately 5.4 million claims in 12 countries with a total collectible value of
approximately €19 billion.

_Debt Purchasing Commercial Process_

Lindorff spent €57 million, €63 million and €66 million of the amount spent on portfolio purchases in
the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 on forward flow arrangements. As of March 31,
2017, Lindorff had 24 forward flow agreements with an annual capital expenditure of approximately
€2.8 million per agreement, and an average contractual duration of 11 months. We believe that forward
flow agreements are beneficial as they provide certainty of a minimum volume of claims on which to
perform debt collection. Similarly, these agreements are beneficial to the seller as they provide a
certain level of predictability of the volume of claims being sold.

During the debt purchasing process, Lindorff’s involves a fully integrated team that conducts an
origination process, a valuation and due diligence process, an offer phase and a contract and closing
phase.

_Co-Investment_

Lindorff increasingly partners and co-invests with financial investors that lack debt collection
capabilities in the purchase of large debt portfolios, including secured loans. In 2016, Lindorff
established an investment vehicle for co-investing in portfolio purchases. Lindorff’s role is to source
and originate the opportunities, undertake due diligence, provide a valuation and analytical services,
and provide third-party collection services on the purchased portfolio on an arm’s length basis through
master servicing agreements. The co-investor typically retains the majority of the investment. Coinvestment is beneficial as it provides Lindorff with a large portfolio on which to perform debt collection
through master servicing agreements, while it also generates debt purchasing gross collections equal
to Lindorff’s share of the investment. Lindorff acquired approximately 27%, 4% and 4% of the principal
amount of portfolios that it purchased in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014,
respectively, via co-investment arrangements. In the past three years, Lindorff has completed 4 coinvestment transactions with purchases amounting to €260 million in aggregate, of which Lindorff
invested €67 million. As of March 31, 2017, 4% of Lindorff’s carrying value of purchased debt consisted
of portfolios purchased pursuant to co-investments.

_Origination_

The majority of portfolios for sale are currently offered to the market through competitive tender
processes, although Lindorff also engages its clients in discussions to purchase portfolios through
bilateral negotiations whenever opportunities arise. A key driver of Lindorff’s success in debt purchasing
has been its ability to leverage its relationships with clients for whom it collects debt through outsourcing
contracts. Lindorff’s local sales teams maintain close relationships with key debt originators in countries
where it has local operations. In addition, its senior management maintains close relationships on a
cross-border level with its major key debt originators and is actively involved in its largest transactions
with these sellers. Through these relationships, Lindorff often receives requests for proposals (“RFPs”)
in relation to the portfolios for sale.

_Valuation and Due Diligence_

Lindorff engages in an extensive valuation of any given portfolio in order to determine what price it
should offer the client. First, it looks at certain characteristics, including the age of the claims in the
portfolio, the size of the portfolio, the type of receivable the portfolio contains and the collection
process already undertaken in order to determine whether the portfolio is suitable. Once it has
determined that a portfolio for sale is suitable, it collaborates with its debt collection team and engages
in an extensive valuation of the portfolio. Lindorff’s use of multiple valuation methods takes into
account, among other factors, the below analyses:

- _vintage analysis, where it uses historical cash flow information to forecast future returns;_


-----

- _production models, where it analyzes the portfolio and makes assumptions on conversion rates_
and average payment levels using benchmark portfolios built on the basis of millions of data
points, customer information and the historical performance of its current portfolios;

- _debt profiles, where it identifies the key value drivers in the portfolio and segments the portfolio_
based on these key value drivers and evaluates the total likely recovery for each claim;

- _scorecards, using all available data (internal, external and client data) to evaluate the propensity_
of each customer in the portfolio to pay and to what amount; and

- _paying books, where it identifies different payment profiles and segment accounts based on_
historic payment behavior.

The emphasis Lindorff places on each valuation method depends on the specific circumstances,
information available and characteristics of the portfolio for sale.

In conjunction with the valuation process, Lindorff also performs due diligence on the portfolio prior to
making a final bid. The purpose of this due diligence process is to identify any areas of risk that would
impact Lindorff’s ability to successfully manage the portfolio following its purchase. As part of the due
diligence process, Lindorff requests and works to verify certain data fields, including claim balances,
payment history on claims, details of credit agreements and legal enforceability. Additionally, Lindorff
undertakes a detailed review of the assumptions that it applied as part of the valuation process and
determines whether those assumptions need to be adjusted. For certain transactions, Lindorff also
engages external advisors for this process. Lindorff seeks to leverage its relationships with clients to
assist it with this process by obtaining guidance on pricing, where possible.

We believe that Lindorff has a competitive advantage when it is invited to bid on a portfolio that it
performs debt collection on because it is able to accurately assess the potential uplift that can be
generated given its familiarity with the debt collection measures that have been undertaken, allowing
it to accurately price the portfolio. This results in being able to confidently offer an attractive value
proposition to clients, which makes it a strong contender for portfolios that it finds attractive.

_Offer_

Depending on the size of the transaction, the assessment and final pricing of a portfolio involves input
from Lindorff’s country-level management and operations, its debt purchasing and debt collection
teams, its IT team and senior executives. This group works together to use the information gathered in
the process to prepare the final bid, and the relevant country level team uses its knowledge and
expertise to provide a current and accurate reflection on the competitive environment in order to
ensure that any final bid is aligned with the competing offers the client is likely to receive. The final bid
is determined based on an analysis of various scenarios, which are designed to test Lindorff’s models
at the high and low ends of prior experience, and is evaluated and approved by pre-defined levels of
management, depending on the size of the bid. The final price that Lindorff offers for a portfolio takes
into account the return that it requires to compensate for the risk present in the transaction, the
possibility that actual performance of the portfolio may deviate from the expected performance and the
level of competition that it faces in the market.

We believe that a key driver of Lindorff’s success in debt purchasing is due to its ability to leverage its
relationships with clients. Lindorff uses these relationships to engage in a dialogue with the client in
order to assist it in putting together a competitive bid. These relationships can also be used to propose
alternative structures to those that were requested if Lindorff believes it will create value for itself and
the client. Lindorff also frequently receives a “first and last look opportunity” at a portfolio due to these
pre-existing relationships.

_Contract and Closing_

The majority of Lindorff’s portfolio purchases, clients receive a one-off cash payment. However, Lindorff
also offers different pricing models in an effort to address specific needs or desires of its clients. One
such alternative pricing model is an “earn-out model,” which provides for profit sharing, where the


-----

client receives an upfront cash payment for the portfolio based on an initial forecast and then receives
a percentage of any gains above the initial forecast.

_Implementation_

After purchasing a portfolio, if Lindorff does not already perform debt collection on the purchased
portfolio, it must ensure that claim balances are accurately recorded, funds paid between the
determination date and the closing date by customers are received, and customers are diverted to the
appropriate phase of the collection process. Lindorff also screens individual claims against various
databases to determine whether any of the individual claims do not meet the specified criteria and
should be returned, if contractually permitted. If Lindorff already services the purchased portfolio, the
risks associated with the conversion process are minimized, since many of these steps have already
been undertaken as part of its debt collection services.

_Contact and Collection Process_

After acquiring a portfolio, Lindorff typically manages the portfolio in-house. Lindorff’s deep insight of
the debt collection process enables it to tailor customized approaches for each customer and to
determine whether it can extract additional value from a customer and uplift on a portfolio by applying
different collection methods than were used previously. By typically servicing purchased portfolios inhouse, Lindorff also provides stability and scale to the debt collection segment of its business, which
allows it to improve and enhance its debt collection methods. For a further discussion on the debt
collection process, see “—Debt Collection—Debt Collection Process.”

**_Other Services_**

Lindorff offers a wide range of information, payment and invoicing services before debt is considered
non-performing.

_Information Services_

Information services include credit information and analysis, data extraction and modelling and
scorecard input and development. We believe that information services enable clients to mitigate credit
risk and reduce potential losses from sales to new clients by providing efficient and reliable information
on the creditworthiness of their customers.

_Lindorff Payment_

Lindorff recently launched Lindorff Payment, a service that allows retailers and other consumer
companies to expand their offered payment methods and provide their customers with the option of
purchasing a product or a service via invoice payment in one or more instalments. Effectively, Lindorff
assumes the credit risk and provides the upfront payment, at a discounted rate, to the retailers and
consumer companies and then undertakes the entire credit management process, from the scoring
and credit decision to processing and distributing the invoice, with the customer. Where customers
choose invoice as a payment method, the credit decision will be made in real time at the time of
purchase. Lindorff Payment works in both online and offline in-store systems and it captures the
popularity of omni-channel shopping and invoice as an available payment method. It enables clients
to meet heightened customer expectation of seamless shopping experiences between e-commerce
and retail stores. At the same time, Lindorff Payment clients retain control of the branding of the invoice
and may also use the invoice as an additional sales channel by enclosing marketing material together
with the invoice. Lindorff Payment has entered into a partnership with the payment solutions provider,
Bambora Group AB, in Norway, which it expects to support the further growth of this service.

_Invoicing Services_

Invoicing services include invoicing and reminder services. We believe that Lindorff’s invoicing services
provide reliable and cost efficient solutions for clients with high invoicing volumes and helps clients to
increase sales by enabling credit sales with limited credit risk or need for a credit process.

**Lindorff Business Services**

In June 2014, Lindorff established Lindorff Business Services (“LBS”) in Vilnius, Lithuania. LBS is an
in-house center of excellence that supports Lindorff by providing back-office type services to improve
efficiency, quality of services and market responsiveness and to utilize scale and skill advantages,
consolidate functions and further develop knowledge sharing within Lindorff. LBS employs over 200
FTEs and has thus far primarily contributed to the operations in higher wage countries, such as the
Nordics, with the intention to expand the services of LBS across Lindorff’s geographical markets.

Lindorff established LBS IT Shared Service Center (“SSC”) in Wroclaw, Poland in December, 2016 to
complement its center in Vilnius. SSC supports the Lindorff companies in their application of IT-related
solutions and product development, it supports the near-shoring of existing IT services and it operates
as a back-up facility for LBS. SSC currently employs 12 FTEs, though Lindorff intends to ramp up
operations over the coming years, with a corresponding increase in the number of FTEs.

**Lindorff: Business Intelligence**

The characteristics of the debt purchasing and debt collection markets provide a competitive
advantage to participants with the strongest data assets and analytical capabilities. We believe that
directly employing, training and monitoring debt collection specialists is essential to extracting value
from claims and pricing portfolios accurately. We believe that Lindorff often finds opportunities to
improve performance in a large portion of the portfolios that it purchases due to analysis of its data
assets.

Lindorff has developed databases of customer and credit information over 20 years as a result of the
high volume of debt collection it performs in-house. Over time, Lindorff has collected depersonalized
data on over 60 million claims across both debt collection, within the CMS service line, and debt
purchasing, within the Financial Services service line. Lindorff analyzes these databases to assist in the
pricing of potential purchases of portfolios and to devise optimal collection strategies for customers.
For example, Lindorff is able to model anticipated performance of a portfolio based on the past
performance of claims with similar characteristics, which allows it to determine if there are
opportunities to extract additional cash flow that may not be apparent from traditional pricing models.
Additionally, in devising optimal debt collection strategies, Lindorff can determine what collection
methods have been most successful in the past on customers with similar traits.

We believe that Lindorff’s data assets and analytical capabilities enable it to proactively review
portfolios and collection strategies. Companies that only purchase portfolios typically have less access
to data on customers and associated payment trends until a portfolio is purchased, when the specific
customers in the portfolio can be matched to a credit referencing agency database. In addition,
customer files in a portfolio may contain inaccurate or incomplete information on the name, address
or telephone number of the customer, which can make it difficult to locate the customer or otherwise
complicate the debt collection process. For competitors, this may result in data asymmetry in valuing
portfolios prior to purchase and through the collection process.

**Lindorff: Geographic Presence**

We believe that Lindorff has positioned itself to be an attractive candidate for multinational clients,
especially financial institutions, and has a presence in 12 countries across Europe, excluding Russia
where operations were liquidated in March 2017.

To address competition concerns raised by the European Commission following its investigation of the
Merger, Nordic Capital has committed to divesting the Carveout Business. Lindorff’s distribution of
revenue and ERC by country and geographic region may be significantly affected by divestment of the
Carveout Business. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Divestment of the Carveout
_Business,” “Summary—The Transactions—The Merger,” “Summary—Divestment of the Carveout_
_Business” and_ _“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions—We may not be able to divest the_
_Carveout Business in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, at a reasonable price or at all.”_

The table below shows the revenue generated in each of the regions where it has local operations for
the periods indicated. For these purposes, Northern Europe consists of Denmark, Estonia, Finland,
Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Sweden; Central Europe consists of Germany;
and Southern Europe consists of Italy and Spain.

We believe that clients are able to ensure ethical, consistent and professional service across country
lines by utilizing Lindorff’s services as opposed to contracting multiple, smaller suppliers from many
different countries where there may be different market practices. Lindorff’s local product offerings vary
depending on several market characteristics, including the level of debt collection outsourcing, the
maturity of the market, the propensity of clients to sell portfolios and the overall supply of portfolios
available in the market to purchase. For example, in the Nordic market debt collection outsourcing
levels are substantially higher than the rest of Europe, so debt collection is a strong driver of revenue
in that region. On the contrary, Spain has been among the most active market for debt purchasing in


-----

recent years driven by financial institutions being subject to stricter regulations and internal capacity
constraints. For more information on the differences in the markets in which Lindorff operates,
see “Industry Overview—Overview of the European Credit Management Services and Debt Purchasing
_Industry.”_

Lindorff has selectively pursued potential acquisitions and carve-out transactions to expand its
geographic footprint. For further information on its historical expansion, see “—Lindorff: History” and
_“Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Lindorff—_
_Key Factors Affecting Lindorff’s Results of Operations—Acquisitions and Geographic Expansion.”_
Additionally, Lindorff works closely with a select group of trusted agents around the world to perform
international debt collection. It uses this network of agents to collect debts in Italy, where it does not
currently employ local operating staff, and to collect debts owed by customers who have moved from
a country where it has a local presence to a country where it does not. Lindorff typically seeks to apply
court judgments from the countries in which it operates to the country in which the customers are
presently located through conventions and treaties intended to be binding under international law. To
ensure compliance with Lindorff’s strict ethical standards and to ensure protection of its clients’
reputations, this network of agents has been built over the last 20 years based on stringent standards.
These standards include, but are not limited to, membership in the same organizations that Lindorff is
a part of, a track record of achieving success within a regulatory framework, and the existence of
approved financial statements. Lindorff closely monitors these agents to ensure compliance with the
terms and conditions of its agreements and its ethical standards, as well as the protection of its clients’
reputations.

**Lindorff: Clients**

Lindorff’s clients consist of leading national and international financial institutions, insurance
companies, utilities providers, public sector, telecommunications companies and companies in the
retail sector. Lindorff has a special focus on financial institutions, many of whom it has long-standing
relationships with, as it believes this is an attractive sector due to, among other factors, high industry
growth rates, responsible origination practices and stable and predictable cash flows.

Lindorff’s largest customer generated 7% of its total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016.
We believe that Lindorff has strong, long-standing relationships with its clients. Other than with respect
to the two Spanish financial institutions from whom it acquired collection units in 2013 and 2014, as
described elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, Lindorff has served its five other largest financial
institutional clients by debt collection revenue for an average of ten years and has an average
relationship of five years with its largest five clients by debt purchasing volume. Lindorff benchmarks
its performance against third-party debt collection competitors and regularly monitors its operations to
confirm that it is in compliance with its contracts in order to ensure these strong relationships continue.

**Lindorff: Material Contracts**

**_Acquisitions_**

_Aktua_

On June 1, 2016, Lindorff Iberia Holding, S.L.U., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Lindorff
Holding Spain, acquired 93.66 per cent of the shares in Aktua from a vehicle of Centerbridge Partners
LP, and other minority shareholders, for an acquisition price of €116 million, of which a deferred
consideration of €9 million is outstanding, payable by June 1, 2017. In addition, a contingent
consideration (i.e. an earn-out) of up to €19 million is payable in 2017 and 2018 if Aktua achieves
certain target revenues. The purchase price allocated to assets and liabilities at fair value led to
recognition of goodwill in the amount of €127 million. In July 2016, Lindorff’s ownership interest in
Aktua decreased to approximately 85% as minority interest shareholder Banco Santander acquired an
additional 8.66% of Lindorff’s shares. Banco Santander has a put option right against Lindorff Iberia,
in respect of its 15 per cent stake in Aktua, for the following strike price: (i) the price paid by Lindorff
for the Aktua shares (as adjusted by deferred consideration and any earn-outs or price adjustments
based on liability) plus 8% interest, if exercised on or before July 15, 2018; or (ii) the fair market value,


-----

if exercised after July 15, 2018. Further, Lindorff Iberia has a call option right against Banco Santander
in respect of its 15% stake, for the following strike price: (i) price paid by Lindorff for the Aktua shares
(as adjusted by deferred consideration and any earn-outs or price adjustments based on liability) plus
8% interest, if exercised on or before July 15, 2018; or (ii) the fair market value, if exercised after July
15, 2018. Lindorff Iberia is obliged to exercise the call option if it denies a request from Banco
Santander to transfer its 15% stake in Aktua Holdings to a third party. Aktua is a servicing company
providing mainly secured NPL services and real estate servicing in Spain.

On March 10, 2016, prior to the Aktua Acquisition, Aktua acquired 100 per cent of the share capital of
Ibercaja Group’s servicer, Gestión de Inmuebles Salduvia, S.A (later renamed Aktua Soluciones
Inmobiliarias, S.L). The servicer was acquired from Ibercaja, S.A. and Ibercaja Banco, S.A. The
acquisition was made by Aktua through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Global Acamar, S.L. (later
renamed, Aktua Gestión de Inmuebles, S.L.). Such transaction also included the execution of a tenyear servicing agreement in relation to the management, on an exclusive basis, of certain real estate
assets of the Ibercaja Group.

**_Co-Investment Agreement_**

On November 1, 2016, Lindorff, CarVal and AlbaCore (CarVal and AlbaCore, the “Co-Investors”),
Lindorff No 1 Designated Activity Company (“Lindorff SPV”), Lindorff No 2 Designated Activity
Company (“CarVal SPV”) and Lindorff No 3 Designated Activity Company (“AlbaCore SPV,” and each
of Lindorff SPV, CarVal SPV and AlbaCore SPV, an “SPV”) entered into a co-investment agreement
(the “CIA”). Pursuant to the CIA, Lindorff and the Co-Investors will co-invest in certain portfolios of
wholly or predominantly unsecured non-performing loans within the Lindorff’s servicing capabilities
(such co-investment program referred to herein as the “Co-Investment Partnership”). The
geographical scope of the Co-Investment Partnership includes most of Lindorff’s existing markets, and
any other geography as may be agreed among the SPVs from time to time (subject to certain
geographical diversification requirements), and the targeted portfolios of the Co-Investment
Partnership must meet specific size (with a focus on larger portfolios) and expected return
requirements (“Eligible Portfolios”).

CarVal and AlbaCore announced an intention to deploy up to a total of €350 million in aggregate and
Lindorff announced an intention to deploy a variable amount determined on a case-by-case basis.
Each of Lindorff and each Co-Investor will provide funding to its SPV.

_Cooperation_

Lindorff has undertaken to present to the Co-Investment Partnership on an exclusive basis all portfolios
that are Eligible Portfolios (within the meaning of the CIA) and in which Lindorff is considering investing,
which may then be accepted or rejected by the relevant SPVs and, if not accepted within a certain
period or if rejected, may be pursued independently by Lindorff outside of the Co-Investment
Partnership. The obligation for Lindorff and the Co-Investors to cooperate ends on the earlier of
December 31, 2017 or, with respect to each Co-Investor, on the date it has achieved its intended capital
deployment under the Co-Investment Partnership. During such period, Lock Lower Holding and its
subsidiaries are also restricted from participating in certain other co-investment programs in relation to
Eligible Portfolios and similar portfolios in some of its existing markets and in certain new geographies.
The Co-Investment Partnership does not impact Lindorff’s ability to independently consider and invest
in portfolios that are outside the scope of Eligible Portfolios.

_Portfolio management and governance_

The CIA contains certain governance provisions regulating management of portfolios and decisionmaking in relation thereto and Lindorff always has a vote on these matters. Each party will be subject
to certain undertakings (including, in relation to certain dealings, compliance with laws) and will make
certain representations in favor of each other party.


-----

_Servicing and levelling_

Initially, each acquired portfolio shall be serviced by a Lindorff affiliate and shall be subject to a levelling
agreement between the investing SPVs in order to ensure that each investing SPV effectively acquires
a percentage interest in the whole portfolio.

_Exit and termination_

The Co-Investment Partnership term is five years, after which the Co-Investors will have a “put” right
pursuant to which Lindorff SPV is obliged to acquire the Co-Investors’ portfolios on pre-agreed sale
terms (subject to adjustments in certain circumstances). Lindorff SPV has a corresponding “call” right.
To the extent Lindorff SPV defaults on this “put” option, the relevant SPV may sell the relevant portfolio
to a third party (subject to certain requirements intended to achieve a fair market value for such
portfolio) and in such circumstance Lindorff SPV shall pay to the relevant SPV any shortfall as
compared to the pre-agreed sale price. Lindorff provides a guarantee in respect of this obligation.

The CIA is subject to various early termination provisions. In certain circumstances, the “put” and “call”
options survive termination. Following the occurrence of certain termination events or the expiration of
the initial co-investment term, and subject to certain conditions being met, the shares in each SPV
other than the Lindorff SPV, which are subject to a share charge granted by Lindorff in favor of the
relevant Co-Investor, may be transferred to the relevant Co-Investor, or if Lindorff fails to complete the
transfer within a set period of time, the relevant Co-Investor may enforce the share charge.

**Lindorff: Compliance and Quality Control**

Lindorff’s clients deem its ethical behavior and strict compliance with laws and regulations as essential
in order for them to utilize Lindorff’s services. The laws and regulations that Lindorff operates under
have at their core the fair treatment of all customers, which Lindorff has sought to integrate into its dayto-day operations and culture. Lindorff’s debt collection process is designed to yield financial results
while protecting its clients’ reputations. Lindorff believes in:

- polite persistence, where collectors take a fair and reasonable stance when interacting with
customers;

- ensuring a fair outcome for the customer, taking into account sustainability and affordability of
payments; and

- treating customers with respect and dignity.

Lindorff’s internal standards, the Lindorff Business Practice Principles, are applicable to all employees
and all employees are expected to become acquainted with and comply with these standards.
Lindorff’s standard regarding regulatory compliance defines, among other things, governing principles
regarding identification of governing laws and regulations, delegation of compliance responsibilities,
guidelines on education and competence, testing and documentation of regulatory compliance control
measures. On a yearly basis, a compliance self-assessment and review process is made with the
purpose of providing the board of directors, CEO, CFO and executive team with an objective
assessment of the status of Lindorff’s compliance with regards to legislation and regulation, as well as
internal governance principles, policies and procedures. The findings of the assessment enable senior
management to initiate any necessary remedial activities.

Lindorff has invested heavily in its compliance systems and controls, as well as the training of its
employees, to increase awareness of its regulatory requirements and policies. Lindorff provides
comprehensive training to employees on legal and regulatory compliance. Through training sessions,
it is Lindorff’s goal to provide an insight into, and gain an understanding of, an employee’s obligation
in ensuring legal and regulatory compliance. Lindorff also requires its employees to complete a
designated compliance module and complete regular interactive refreshers and tests.

For further information on the regulatory environment under which Lindorff operates, see “Regulatory
_Overview.”_

_on the Board of Directors and Group Management—Internal Control.”_

**Lindorff: Technology Infrastructure**

Lindorff’s IT infrastructure platform supports all facets of its operations and supports its operations in
each country where it has local operations. Lindorff has historically grown through acquisitions, and as
a result operated a number of IT infrastructure platforms across its operations. It has systematically
worked to improve its basic IT infrastructure, and has moved from operating a separate IT platform in
each local operation to having one consolidated IT infrastructure platform, operated by its IT
outsourcing provider, which services most of its local operations.

Lindorff is committed to maintaining high standards of data protection, client information and
information security. It has consolidated all of its operations to one of the global data centers of its IT
outsourcing provider, which secures physical access, error recovery and restore possibilities. Access
to Lindorff’s systems is handled through a standardized infrastructure, with software giving access
rights to individual users. Finally, all infrastructure and systems are protected by firewalls and are
constantly updated to avoid cyber-attacks. For additional information on Lindorff’s IT and other capital
expenditure, see “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations of Lindorff—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital Expenditure.”_

**Lindorff: Employees, Recruiting and Training**

As of March 31, 2017, Lindorff had 4,605 full-time employees in total. Of these, 3,476 were employed
in operations, 190 were employed in information technology support, 398 were employed in sales,
general and administrative, 387 were employed in group level staff functions (including IT and LBS),
and 154 were involved in debt purchase analysis and other businesses.

The table below sets forth the average number of FTEs, including temporary employees, Lindorff had
in each of its local operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

(1)  Lindorff’s businesses in Denmark, Estonia, Finland and Sweden are components of the Carveout Business that Nordic
Capital has committed to selling to address competition concerns raised by the European Commission. See “Summary—
_Divestment of the Carveout Business.”_

(2)  Eastern and Central Europe consists of Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. This region previously included Russia
however Lindorff liquidated its operations in Russia in March 2017.

(3)  As part of the Aktua Acquisition, Lindorff added 429 full-time employees.

We believe that Lindorff has positive relations with its employees and the applicable unions and work
councils. Some of its employees are unionized. Lindorff meets with the unions and work councils on
an annual basis to update them on the direction of the business and to address any concerns that they
may have.

**Lindorff: Legal and Administrative Proceedings**

Lindorff operates in several countries and is, from time to time, subject to disputes, claims and
administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its business, including claims and legal
proceedings regarding VAT, corporate income taxes, intra-group loan pricing, interest cost deductions
and other matters. Other than as discussed below, Lindorff has not been party to any governmental,
legal or arbitration proceedings (including any such proceedings which are pending or threatened of
which it is aware) during the previous 12 months from the date of this Offering Memorandum which
may have, or have had in the recent past, significant effects on Lindorff’s financial position or
profitability.

Lindorff is currently, or was recently, party to a number of ongoing tax disputes and/or investigations
in Finland, Spain, Norway and Sweden.

The Swedish tax agency has denied Lindorff tax deductions on interest expenses on shareholder loans
regarding financial year 2013 and 2014. Lindorff estimates the total tax exposure to be €12 million.
Lindorff has appealed the Swedish tax authority’s decision. No part has been paid to the Swedish tax
authority and, in the event the appeal is unsuccessful, Lindorff will be reimbursed as a result of an
indemnity arrangement originally entered into with its previous owners.

In Norway, the Norwegian tax authorities has denied deduction regarding a loss on an intragroup
receivable. Lindorff has paid the additional tax amounting to €1.3 million, but has filed an appeal.

The Finnish tax authorities questioned the pricing of cross border intragroup loans with Lindorff Finland
OY. Lindorff has appealed the penalties imposed by the authorities and estimates the total tax exposure
in this part to be €8 million of which €4 million has been paid to the Finnish government, while the
remaining €4 million has been provided for in the accounts.

Further, the Finnish tax authorities considered interest expenses in Lindorff’s Finnish branch for
financial years 2008 to 2012 not to be deductible for tax purposes. In August 2016, Lindorff appealed
the Finnish Administrative Court’s decision to deny the tax deductions. In May 2017, Lindorff’s appeal
was rejected. Lindorff estimates the total tax exposure regarding the Finnish branch to be €35 million
(including interest expenses up to and including March 2017) of which €27 million has been paid to
the Finnish government and €8 million has been provided for in the accounts.

Sira Consulting, S.L. has initiated a claim based on breach of contract against Lindorff España, S.A.U.
Sira Consulting, S.L. has sought damages based on the alleged breach of contract in an amount of
€21.6 million, plus legal costs. In September 2016, Lindorff España, S.A.U. was served by the court
with Sira Consulting, S.L.’s claim and a hearing is scheduled for July 2017. Lindorff estimates the total
exposure to be €22 million, of which €1.2 million has been provided for in the accounts.

The vendors of Casus Finanse S.A. have disputed Lindorff’s calculation of nil as the earn-out amount
owing to the vendors under the purchase agreement. The vendors have presented an alternative
calculation, indicating an earn-out amount of approximately €15.3 million. Lindorff has performed an
audit and engaged an independent audit firm to provide a second opinion on Lindorff’s calculations.
The aforementioned audit firm supports Lindorff’s calculations and so, in conjunction with additional
information received, the probability of the vendors being successful in their claim against Lindorff has
been reduced from medium to low and the provision in the accounts has been withdrawn.

Lindorff cooperates with government agencies concerning actual or potential violations of laws, rules
or regulations, typically initiated by customer complaints. The inquiries typically concern alleged data
protection breaches and various legal defenses to collection efforts. Lindorff considers receipt of such
inquiries to be in the ordinary course of business and does not expect business to be materially
impacted as a result of these complaints or inquiries.

**Lindorff: Insurance**

Lindorff’s group-wide insurance policies include insurance to cover risks associated with its business,
including general liability, crime insurance, professional liability and directors’ and officers’ liability


-----

insurance. Lindorff uses an insurance broker to maintain consistency of coverage across jurisdictions.
We believe that the types and amounts of insurance coverage that Lindorff maintains are consistent
with customary industry standards in the jurisdictions where it operates. However, no assurances can
be given that it will continue to maintain current levels of insurance coverage. A successful claim of
sufficient magnitude that is not covered, or only partially covered by insurance, could have a material
adverse effect on Lindorff and its financial condition.

**Lindorff: Real Property**

Lindorff leases its executive offices, which are located at Hoffsveien 70B, 0377 Oslo, Norway. All of
Lindorff’s properties are leased. Lindorff has a specific policy and requirements regarding the physical
security at all its properties.

**Lindorff: Intellectual Property**

While Lindorff holds various trademarks and has registered its domain name, no individual or series of
trademarks or intellectual property is material to its business as a whole.

**Lindorff: Corporate Social Responsibility**

Lindorff has a strong social commitment, anchored in its core values and the way it runs its business.
We believe that business operations that contribute to a sustainable society and help solve social
issues support growth and that effective governance is an essential mechanism in achieving Lindorff’s
strategic goals. When Lindorff acts with high ethical standards and professionalism, it is able to achieve
the level of trust required in its relationships with its employees, clients, customers, authorities and
shareholders. Lindorff’s commitment to social responsibility is carried out in accordance with the
following principles: (i) it balances potential benefits of its actions against the consequences to society
as a whole; (ii) its expectations regarding social responsibility are clearly communicated to its
employees and business partners; (iii) social responsibility guides the development of Lindorff’s
products, services and debt management operations to help ensure that its operations are
characterized by high ethical standards; (iv) Lindorff works to reduce its environmental footprint, and
when purchasing products or services from external parties it emphasizes high environmental
standards; and (v) Lindorff aims to have a transparent management structure in line with national and
international standards for corporate governance.

**_Ethics and responsibility_**

Lindorff’s commitment to corporate social responsibility is integrated into its core business and backed
by Lindorff’s “Business Practice Principles.” These principles are applicable to all employees and all
employees are expected to become acquainted with, and seek to comply with, these standards. These
standards state that all employees are expected to work within the law, have sound moral principles
and behave in an upstanding and sincere way. Lindorff has implemented a centrally coordinated
compliance monitoring program, which evaluates and assesses compliance with legal, regulatory and
industry best practices, as well as its internal standards.

**_Supporting the communities in which it operates_**

Lindorff has a history of engaging with its local communities in charitable projects and employees are
encouraged to be involved in these projects. For example, in Finland, Lindorff has committed €50,000
as a partner of “Me and My City,” an internationally acclaimed Finnish education initiative aimed at
school children that provides insight into society, working life and entrepreneurship. Lindorff is also
involved in Red Nose Day and supports various Christmas drives, raising approximately €15,000 per
year for gifts provided to children in the hospital.

In Sweden, Lindorff has partnered with Stadsmissionen, an organization that supports homeless
people, by hosting certain client events as well as through direct sponsorship. Similarly, in Norway,
Lindorff has contributed funding to Røde Kors’ (the Norwegian Red Cross) initiative Flyktningehjelpen
in support of refugees, both directly and by donating to employees involved in fundraising walks.


-----

Lindorff likewise provided funding to Kirkens Bymisjon in its work to assist refugees’ integration into
society.

Lindorff actively works to be a workplace that promotes equality, diversity and inclusion. For example,
it runs a program in Spain aimed at integrating individuals with Down’s syndrome into its workforce,
with individually tailored goals and KPIs. Employees that are a part of this program have played an
important role in the team’s performance and encouraged team-wide collaboration.

Across Lindorff’s offices, it is engaged in an array of initiatives that seek to train vulnerable individuals
in finance, including educating young debtors in gaining financial control.

### REGULATORY OVERVIEW

As a multinational credit management provider, we are subject to various laws and regulations in the
jurisdictions in which we operate. The credit management industry is highly influenced by legislation,
judicial rulings and regulatory decisions and oversight. Credit management companies additionally
must comply with various licensing, registration and other similar requirements in order to operate their
businesses. As a result, our financial condition and projections are susceptible to changes in the
regulatory environment.

For a description of certain material effects of laws and regulations on our business, see “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry and Business—We operate in a variety of jurisdictions and must_
_comply with applicable laws, regulations, licenses and codes of practice across all jurisdictions._
_Changes to the regulatory or political environments in which we operate may negatively affect our_
_business.” The descriptions provided under the captions “—Internal Rules Framework” and_
“—Compliance Procedures” apply to Intrum Justitia and will apply to the Company following the
Merger.

**Regulation of the Credit Management Industry**

Legislative, judicial and regulatory decisions affect us in a number of different ways. This overview will
highlight seven areas of regulatory focus that have affected, and will continue to affect, our operations:
fair debt collection practices, statutes of limitations, enhanced consumer protection, consumer credit
development, corporate social responsibility, data protection and anti-money laundering regimes.

**_Fair Debt Collection Practices_**

As debt collection regulation is not based on specific EU legislation, it is not possible to make use of
a passporting or similar regime. Instead, each country has developed its own set of rules for debt
collection operations. The regulations cover, among other things: the methods by which claims can be
assigned or transferred; the ways in which a customer can be contacted and a debt collected; and the
types and level of fees, interests and costs that can be imposed, and whether those fees, interests and
costs can be passed to the customer or the client.

In countries where there are no specific regulations covering debt collection and where no licensing
requirements apply for certain debt collection operations, there are still regulations of a more general
nature which we must observe when carrying out our debt collection operations. Such regulations
include, for example, general civil and commercial rules and consumer protection laws and regulations
regarding caps on collection fees and interest costs. In addition, in a number of markets in which we
operate, the reimbursement of costs for debt collection is limited by law. Any regulatory changes
reducing the amount of such costs we can recover may have a negative impact on our results of
operations.

In many of the countries in which our operations are licensed or regulated, our subsidiaries are subject
to certain integrity tests with respect to debt collection. These integrity tests may include verifying that:
the collection business is carried out in accordance with local rules and regulations; consumer lending
operations are conducted in accordance with sound lending practices; the directors of the board have
sufficient knowledge and experience and have not misused any debt collection permissions; and the
directors meet other general suitability and reliability checks.

**_Statutes of Limitations_**

Rules regarding the length of time after which an unpaid debt may not be pursued by creditors and
the ways in which the statute of limitations can be tolled so that a debt can remain collectible also vary
across jurisdictions. In a majority of the countries in which we operate, it is possible to extend the
statutes of limitation on historic debt claims indefinitely by using various methods, including
enforcement actions, notification of the customer or otherwise interrupting the limitation period with
continued court proceedings. Some of the countries in which we operate have in recent years changed
the statutes of limitation for certain debt including by limiting the ability to extend or interrupt the


-----

limitation period, or have discussed doing so. We constantly monitor any changes in these rules in the
countries in which we operate, and, where appropriate, implement local procedures to interrupt the
limitations period. Any significant reduction in the statute of limitations or in the ability to toll the statute
of limitations, and any failure to implement local procedures to interrupt the limitations periods, would
negatively impact our operations.

**_Enhanced Consumer Protection_**

There has been a trend in recent years to afford more protection to consumers. Various laws,
regulations and judicial decisions in jurisdictions in which we operate have changed the way we
operate and some have negatively impacted our financial condition. For example, a few countries have
proposed giving bailiffs the right to provide services in the pre-legal market, including the right to
purchase debts and perform voluntary collections. We are currently assessing the impact of these
proposals on the relevant subsidiaries and are closely involved in the legislative processes.

Consumer protection laws can limit our ability to enforce debt claims. For example, in Finland, the
enforcement of a consumer debt claim in the event of a default by the customer is subject to
restrictions, such as a minimum period of time having passed since the payment due date and a
minimum proportion of the debt remaining outstanding. Further, enforcement is prohibited if the
payment default of the consumer customer is due to social force majeure, such as illness or
unemployment, or other circumstance beyond the customer’s control, unless it would be perceptibly
unreasonable to the creditor in the circumstances. Similar laws exist in other jurisdictions in which we
operate.

Certain countries in which we have operations have taken steps to facilitate debt restructuring by
individuals, whereby a payment plan for all outstanding indebtedness is initiated. After making all
payments pursuant the payment plan, the customer is no longer liable to pay any of the debt included
in the debt reconstruction. In Sweden, a new Debt Reconstruction Act (Sw. _Skuldsaneringslag_
2016:675) came into effect on November 1, 2016, under which eligible customers are allowed a
payment plan shorter than the normal five years. In Norway, a debt reconstruction may involve either
a delay in payment of all or part of a debt; the creditors waiving, in whole or in part, their claims on
interest or fees; and/or the customer no longer being liable to pay the debt after a particular period of
time.

Other jurisdictions have taken measures to impose moratoriums on collections procedures under
certain conditions or offer other collections solutions to those in debt. In 2013, the Spanish Act for the
Support of Entrepreneurs introduced an out-of-court payment arrangement proceeding (Sp. acuerdo
_extrajudicial de pagos) in the Spanish Insolvency Act, available to natural and legal persons meeting_
certain requirements. A customer unable to meet its payment obligations may apply for this procedure
and a mediator will be appointed. The opening of the out-of-court payment arrangement procedure will
the stay enforcement of claims over assets of the debtor for a maximum of three months, except under
certain circumstances, and suspend the accrual of interest during the negotiation period and for a
maximum of three months. Payment agreements may include the assignment of certain assets of the
debtor for payment of the debt, a reduction of debt, moratoriums of up to ten years or a conversion of
debt into equity or into profit participative loans with a term of up to ten years. Creditors may suggest
changes to the proposed agreement, which is subject to a majority vote by creditors and may therefore
be imposed on dissenting unsecured creditors. If the out-of-court procedure does not succeed, the
mediator must immediately file for the customer’s insolvency and will be appointed as the insolvency
administrator. In the Netherlands, a so-called ‘broad moratorium’ came recently into force that provides
for a temporary cooling off period for the customer to achieve a more stable financial situation.

Customers may also become subject to insolvency proceedings which may result in a delay or
prevention in the enforcement of the claims transferred to us, including reductions in principal or
interest. Collection of unsecured claims in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency is generally limited by
means of the funds available for distribution from the insolvent estate.


-----

**_Consumer Credit Development_**

Consumer credit operations have received increased regulatory attention in many of the jurisdictions
in which we operate. Some countries have imposed caps on interest rates or total cost of credit and
further regulated consumer loans with small principal values. Other countries have targeted particular
types of consumer credit agreements. In the Netherlands, a Supreme Court ruling in June 2014 held
that telecom consumers party to an agreement in which a “free” phone is provided are protected by
certain laws and regulations relating to payments by instalments and consumer credit.

Another pronounced effect of this enhanced focus on consumer credit has been to increase the scope
of which entities must hold a consumer credit license. In reaction to a recent European Court of Justice
case, Verein für Konsumenteninformation v INKO, Inkasso GmbH, that held debt collection companies
were credit intermediaries and thus not required to provide pre-contractual information to consumers,
many countries took legislative action to impose a requirement on debt collection companies to
register with the local authority or obtain a consumer credit license. Stricter regulations in general may
increase the compliance burden and operating costs.

**_Corporate Social Responsibility_**

We commit to pursuing broader social and environmental goals in addition to our business objectives.
As a result, company time and resources are spent for charitable purposes, to undertake initiatives to
serve our communities, to decrease our environmental footprint and to assess and produce reports on
our progress toward these goals. In April 2016 Intrum Justitia chose to sign the United Nations (“UN”)
Global Compact, the ten principles for sustainable enterprise developed by the UN, by which it formally
committed to a number of principles of sustainability. Specifically, the Global Compact means that we
will commit to: (a) conducting our operations in a responsible manner, in line with the ten principles of
sustainability; (b) taking steps to support the communities in which we operate; (c) establishing
commitment at the highest level (the board of directors and senior management) and making
sustainability work part of the company’s DNA; (d) preparing an annual report on our progress; and
(e) engaging the company in sustainability issues locally. Intrum Justitia submitted its first report to the
UN in April 2017.

**_Data Protection_**

We process personal data in our business, both when providing debt collection services and
undertaking debt purchasing. The processing of personal data by companies established within the
EU is governed by the EU data protection directive (95/46/EC) (“Directive 95/46/EC”) as transposed
into national law by each member state. Similar laws are in place in Norway and Switzerland. Although
based on a directive, the national data protection laws are not identical; therefore slightly different
requirements may apply to each of our subsidiaries within the EU. The requirements include that
personal data may only be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and may only be
processed in a manner consistent with these purposes. Further, personal data must be adequate,
relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which it is collected and/or processed and it
must not be kept for a longer period of time than necessary for the purposes of the collection. In
several jurisdictions, however, the local anti-money laundering legislation requires that the financial
undertakings store data obtained in relation to customer due diligence for five years after the closure
of a customer relationship or five years after a transaction has been executed, regardless of whether
the storage is considered necessary.

We are also subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in each country where we
operate. To comply with regulatory requirements, we have established data protection processes,
including having in place data protection policies, information security policies, data retention policies
and procedures for handling data subject requests. Furthermore, many jurisdictions in which we
operate require that we acquire a license from, or register with, the local data protection authority.

On April 27, 2016, Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the
processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC
(General Data Protection Regulation) (the “GDPR”) was adopted by the European Parliament and the


-----

Council. The GDPR will be directly applicable in all member states on May 25, 2018, and replaces
Directive 95/46/EC and current national data protection legislation (to the extent such legislation
contradicts the GDPR). The GDPR furthermore contains several opening clauses, whereby member
states may enact specific national rules in specified areas. It is not yet fully clear how the member
states in which we operate will make use of these opening clauses, and how this might affect our
business. We expect the data protection policies of our entities outside of the EU to largely be in line
with the GDPR by the time of its entry into force. As Norway is a part of the EEA, and not the EU, the
GDPR has to be implemented into Norwegian law before it becomes applicable in Norway. However,
the GDPR will likely be implemented into Norwegian law around the same time as it becomes law in
the EU. In Switzerland, legislation is being considered that would update data protection law to be
more consistent with EU law. In the UK, it is not yet clear what impact the announced exit from the EU
will have on our data protection responsibilities, including with respect to length of time such data may
be retained and whether such data must stay within the UK. However, all of our entities, including any
in the UK, will be included in the our Company-wide GDPR Program, as further described below, to
ensure the data protection policies across all of our entities are harmonious.

The GDPR significantly changes the EU data protection landscape, including strengthening of
individuals’ rights, stricter requirements on companies processing personal data and stricter sanctions
with administrative fines up to €20 million or, in the case of undertakings, 4% of global turnover,
whichever is higher. GDPR also offers data subjects the option to let a privacy organization litigate on
their behalf, including collecting the potential damages. We have established a data protection project
team, with representatives from the compliance, IT, operations and legal departments, and are
currently assessing the full impact of the GDPR, including identifying risks and relevant measures to
ensure compliance. We endeavor to expeditiously implement the GDPR requirements and to enhance
awareness, governance and controls of data protection procedures throughout our operations. This
will ensure that our data protection policies are effective and applied consistently going forward.

**_Anti-Money Laundering_**

As part of certain operations, especially debt purchasing and financing operations, we follow
anti-money laundering and countering terrorist financing standards set forth in the applicable local
laws implementing Directive (EU) 2005/60/EC on the prevention of the use of the financial system for
the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing. Our operations are also subject to
requirements of local anti-money laundering laws.

On 20 May, 2015, Directive (EU) 2015/849 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the
purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing, amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, and
repealing Directive 2005/60/EC (the “4th AML Directive”) was adopted by the European Parliament and
the Council. The 4th AML Directive enhances the current client due diligence requirements and also
imposes stricter sanctions with administrative fines of at least €5,000,000 or 10% of total annual
turnover. The 4th AML directive directs all EU member states to transpose the directive into local law
by June 2017. To ensure compliance with the 4th AML directive, we have established a specificallydesigned initiative, the AML Project, and appointed a group AML officer to monitor transposition of the
4th AML Directive, coordinate implementation of required solutions for new client due diligence
measures and ensure ongoing monitoring of clients and their transactions. We are also in the process
of enhancing the client screening against sanctions lists by implementing advanced IT solutions as
part of the AML Project objectives.

**Regulatory Licenses**

**_Debt Collection_**

In several of the countries where we operate and provide debt collection services, debt collection is a
regulated area and companies providing such services are subject to licensing or registration
requirements. In these countries, the entity offering debt collection services has a license issued by, or
is otherwise registered with, the relevant local authority. Although the relevant local authority varies by
jurisdiction, normally it is the national financial supervisory authority, police commissioner, data


-----

inspection authority, regional state administrative agency or, in some cases, the national association
for debt collection companies.

**_Purchased Debt_**

Our debt purchasing operations in certain subsidiaries subjects us to various licensing, registration
and permit regimes. Many jurisdictions deem debt purchasing as a financial undertaking or as
providing credit services, and thus require debt purchasing companies to obtain approval from a local
authority in order to operate their businesses. As these regulations are not based on EU legislation,
each country has developed its own requirements relating to the investment in debt portfolios. In some
cases, our entity is licensed as a financial undertaking by the local financial supervisory authority for
purchasing debt portfolios from financial institutions and is required to hold a type of bank or credit
license for its debt purchasing operations. In some jurisdictions, purchasing performing mortgages
portfolios could trigger certain requirements, such as having to obtain a credit license, comply with
AML measures or maintain a certain level of civil liability insurance.

Many countries specifically regulate the assignment of debt claims to other parties. For example, in
Norway, such contracts can only be assigned without consent of the debtor to other financial
institutions and Norwegian regulators can reject the transfer of a loan portfolio to non-financial
institutions if the portfolio is of significance for any of the involved entities. Additionally, some
jurisdictions make it more difficult for factoring contracts to be assigned. In most of the jurisdictions in
which we operate, the court will refer to the contract in determining whether an assignment is allowed,
but in some the courts will weigh special considerations favoring consumers in deciding whether to
allow an assignment.

**_Consumer Credit Operations_**

Our consumer credit operations in various jurisdictions are subject to specific licensing or registration
requirements by the respective regulatory bodies and supervision by consumer advocacy agencies.
As a result of these consumer credit licenses, certain rules regarding ownership, ownership
management and management assessment apply to us. These rules involve, among other things, that
approval from the relevant authorities must be obtained prior to a shareholder acquiring shares that
would bring the shareholder’s direct or indirect holding of any of our license-holding entities to, or in
excess of, certain thresholds or the shareholder otherwise obtaining a significant influence over the
management of any of the license-holding entities. The entities subject to consumer license
requirements often must comply with other requirements, such as having dedicated compliance and
internal control resources or meeting capital adequacy requirements that are similar to those
applicable to banks.

**Internal Rules Framework**

**_Process and Structure_**

Given the level of regulation to which we are subject, we have adopted, and will continue to adopt and
implement following the Merger, best practice principles regarding our internal governance procedures
and our regulatory requirements. This internal framework constitutes a set of minimum requirements
to be observed within the Company to ensure we are operating in accordance with the law and
maintaining high ethical standards. By outlining the applicable requirements and responsibilities, our
goal is to remain in compliance with laws and regulations governing our business activities and, by so
doing, reducing the risk of regulatory breach and subsequent reputational and financial impact on us.

We have enhanced our group-wide internal rules to improve adherence across all of our operations.
These improvements include application of an “end-user perspective,” division of our internal rules
framework into three major blocks—how we run the Company, how we run our business and how we
run our support functions—and instituting a stricter process in general for monitoring our operations
and implementing rules.


-----

**_Dedicated Ownership and Yearly Review_**

We designate so-called Group Owners to be responsible for monitoring and implementing group-wide
rules. The Group Owner ensures that all relevant units and functions within the Company are informed
about our policies. Typically, this is handled in a referral process whereby Group Owners distribute
information on forthcoming, updated or new rules. Local entities use a similar structure and appoint
Local Owners, who ensure that all relevant functions and units on the local level are informed about
new rules and any changes to existing rules.

All group-wide internal rules are subject to annual review. The yearly review process is taking place in
November and December of this year in order to take into account for any changes in the business
plans that might have an impact on the governance structure. The proposed changes are presented
to, and approved by, the CEO and/or the Board.

**_Yearly Follow-up on Implementation_**

Local compliance officers support the implementation of group-wide internal rules within local entities
and follow up with yearly reports on how thoroughly they have been implemented. A rule-by-rule
assessment is made based on pre-defined criteria and is checked by the local compliance officer. The
assessment is signed by the local managing director and is transmitted to our group compliance team
for analysis and reporting on the group level.

**Compliance Procedures**

Our policy regarding regulatory compliance defines, among other things, governing principles
regarding identification of governing laws and regulations, delegation of compliance responsibilities,
requirements on education and competence, monitoring, testing and documentation of regulatory
compliance control measures. This instruction applies to all countries and operational units within the
Company.

We have established a bank-style governance, applying the three lines of defense model, which
positions us well for regulatory changes. The compliance function, along with the risk function, is part
of the second line of defense and supports the implementation of compliance management
procedures within the business and support functions as well as measures, monitors and reports on
compliance risks.

All of our business entities have an appointed local compliance officer who reports on a regular basis
to the local managing director and, secondarily, to the local board and the group compliance officer.
The group compliance officer reports directly to the group’s chief risk officer, and, secondarily, to the
Board.

**_Risks Covered by the Compliance Procedures_**

The compliance activities are typically performed within the focus areas listed below. The focus areas
for a specific business entity are adapted for the entity in question according to the size and complexity
of its operations, its regulatory requirements and its identified risks.

- Treating customers fairly: focus on end-customer protection, fair debt collection practices,
handling of client/customer complaints, safeguarding of customer/client assets, customer/client
marketing, information and documentation;

- Regulatory licenses: permits, approvals and notifications required by any financial supervisory
authority, data protection authority, company registrar, national bank or other similar entities;

- Internal governance: clear and documented organizational structure that specifies reporting
lines, approval levels/mandates and functions, including the management of outsourced
activities;


-----

- Market conduct: customer/client confidentiality and integrity, disclosure of major shareholdings,
gifts and entertainments and anti-bribery, market abuse, insider trading, anti-corruption and
antitrust provisions;

- Conflicts of interest: shall be broadly interpreted to include relations with customers and clients,
external assignments and board and management decisions;

- Anti-money laundering and terrorist financing: know your customer (KYC) procedures,
monitoring customers and transactions, investigations and reporting requirements;

- Data protection: compliance with requirements from local data protection authorities and
implementation of robust internal controls and routines.

**_Regulatory Watch_**

Each compliance officer monitors regulatory developments and informs relevant stakeholders,
management and the board about the new regulatory requirements before they are effective and as
soon as practically possible. The regulatory requirements applicable for each entity are documented
in a so-called Regulatory Map.

**_Quarterly Reporting_**

Each local compliance officer submits quarterly compliance reports to the group compliance team that
includes information on new rules and regulations, material compliance risks and a recommendation
on the actions required for risk mitigation. It also contains any material communication with local
authorities.

**_Risk Analysis_**

The compliance risks that are governed by our group compliance policy are assessed and
documented on at least a yearly basis in a so-called Compliance Risk Map, which is maintained for all
of our operational entities. The Compliance Risk Map forms the basis for our yearly compliance
program, as further explained below.

**_Compliance Programs_**

All entities shall create their own compliance program and update it on a yearly basis. This program
must contain support activities, such as training, information and compliance related projects, and
monitoring and control activities related to the risk areas covered by our compliance policies. Our
group compliance team also mandates particular support and control activities to be carried out by
local entities.

**_Incident Handling and Escalation Procedures_**

Each compliance officer must report immediately to the local management, the local board and to the
group compliance officer on any new, significant compliance risks, incident, issues or breaches or any
significant regulatory visits, inspections, sanctions or material correspondence with
authorities/regulators.

_Indebtedness”, the Company and its restricted subsidiaries, the “Group”) and certain of its restricted_
subsidiaries will enter into a €1,100 million multicurrency revolving credit facility agreement (the
“Revolving Credit Facility Agreement”) with, among others, Swedbank AB (publ), as facility agent
and security agent, and Danske Bank A/S, DNB Bank ASA, Nordea Bank AB (publ), Nykredit Bank A/S
and Swedbank AB (publ), as lenders.

The revolving credit facility made available under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (the
“Revolving Credit Facility”) may be utilized by any current or future borrower under the Revolving


-----

Credit Facility Agreement in euro, Swiss francs, sterling, Norwegian krone, Swedish krona, Danish
krone or any other readily available and agreed currency by the drawing of cash advances or the
issuance of letters of credit or ancillary facilities. The Revolving Credit Facility may be used to refinance
certain existing indebtedness and related hedging agreements of the Group which are to be repaid
and prepaid on the Closing Date, for financing or refinancing the working capital and general corporate
purposes of the Group, including the Merger and any acquisition permitted or not prohibited by the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (including, without limitation, any acquisition of debt portfolios to
the extent permitted or not prohibited by the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) but not for the
payment of any dividend, redemption, repurchase, defeasement, retirement, repayment, premium or
any other distribution in respect of the share capital of the Company.

In addition, the Company may elect to request additional facilities as additional tranches under the
Revolving Credit Facility (the “Additional Facility Commitments”). The Company and the lenders may
agree to certain terms in relation to the Additional Facility Commitments, including the margin and the
termination date (each subject to parameters as set out in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) and
the availability period.

The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized from the Closing Date until the date falling 53 months after
the Closing Date. The original borrowers under the Revolving Credit Facility are the Company and Lock
AS.

**_Interest and fees_**

Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will initially bear interest at rates per annum equal
to, for loans denominated in euro, EURIBOR, for loans denominated in Norwegian krone, NIBOR, for
loans denominated in Swedish krona, STIBOR, for loans denominated in Danish krone, CIBOR, or for
loans denominated in any other currency, LIBOR, plus a margin of 3.00% per annum, subject to a
margin ratchet based on the Net Leverage Ratio. The margin on any loans under an Additional Facility
Commitment will be agreed between the Company and the relevant lenders.

A commitment fee is payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Revolving
Credit Facility from the Closing Date to the end of the availability period for the Revolving Credit Facility
at a rate of 35% of the applicable margin for the Revolving Credit Facility. The commitment fee is
payable quarterly in arrears, on the last date of availability of the Revolving Credit Facility and on the
date the Revolving Credit Facility is cancelled in full or on the date on which a lender cancels its
commitment. Default interest is calculated as an additional 1% on any overdue amount. The Company
is also required to pay customary agency fees to the facility agent and the security agent in connection
with the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Repayments_**

Each advance is required to be repaid on the last day of the interest period relating thereto, subject to
a netting mechanism against amounts to be drawn on such date. All outstanding amounts under the
Revolving Credit Facility are required to be repaid on the termination date, which is the date falling
54 months after the Closing Date. The termination date for a facility under an Additional Facility
Commitment is the date agreed between the Company and the relevant lender(s) providing that
Additional Facility Commitment (subject to certain parameters referred to in the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement). Amounts repaid by the borrowers on loans made under the Revolving Credit
Facility may be re-borrowed during the availability period for that facility, subject to certain conditions.


-----

**_Mandatory prepayment_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement allows for voluntary prepayments (subject to minimum
amounts). The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also permits each lender to require the mandatory
prepayment of all amounts due to that lender:

(1) upon the occurrence of a change of control;

(for these purposes, “change of control” means at any time:

(i) any person or group of persons (other than Cidron 1748 S.à r.l or management team or
any person directly or indirectly controlled by any of them) who does not currently control
any member the Group acting in concert gains (directly or indirectly) control of the
Company; or

(ii) the shares of the Company cease to be listed, traded or publicly quoted on NASDAQ
Stockholm for any reason (excluding, for this purpose, any temporary suspension or
limitation imposed on trading such shares which is remedied within three business days).

Where “control” of the Company or a member of the Group means ownership (directly or
indirectly) of the issued shares in the Company or a member of the Group with the right to cast,
or control the casting of, more than 30 per cent. of the maximum number of votes that might be
cast at a general meeting of the Company or such member of the Group.

(2) upon the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Group (taken as a whole), to a person
who is not a member of the Group.

**_Guarantees_**

The original guarantors under the Revolving Credit Facility are the Issuer and Lock AS. The Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement requires that (subject to agreed security principles) certain entities as agreed
between the Issuer and the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and each subsidiary of the
Company that is a Material Company by reference to the original financial statements will, within
90 days following the Closing Date, become a guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement.

Following any acquisition which is permitted or not prohibited by the terms of the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement and within 60 days of the closing date of such acquisition, the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement requires that (subject to agreed security principles) each subsidiary of the
Company that is a Material Company (which definition includes, among other things, any member of
the Group that has earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization representing 5% or
more of consolidated EBITDA of the Group or whose gross assets represent 5% or more of the
consolidated gross assets of the Group and calculated by reference to the most recent annual financial
statements of the Group as if such subsidiary had been a member of the Group on the relevant
accounting date) will become a guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement further requires that (subject to agreed security principles) as
soon as practicable after any acquisition permitted thereunder in respect of any company that would
become a Material Company (by reference to the most recent annual financial statements and
calculated as though such company had been a member of the Group on the relevant annual
accounting date) the relevant acquired company will be required to become a guarantor under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

Furthermore, if on the last day of a fiscal year, the guarantors represent less than 80% of the
consolidated EBITDA and consolidated gross assets of the Group (subject to certain exceptions),
within 90 days of delivery of the annual financial statements for the relevant fiscal year, such other
restricted subsidiaries of the Company (subject to agreed security principles) are required to become
additional guarantors until the requirement is satisfied (to be calculated as if such additional guarantors
had been guarantors on such last day of the relevant fiscal year).


-----

**_Security_**

Any Material Company or other member of the Group which becomes a guarantor of the Revolving
Credit Facility is required (subject to agreed security principles) to grant security over certain of its
assets described therein in favor of the Security Agent.

**_Representations and warranties_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties
(subject to certain exceptions and qualifications and with certain representations and warranties being
repeated), including status and incorporation, binding obligations, non-conflict with constitutional
documents, laws or other obligations, power and authority, authorizations, no default, governing law
and enforcement, insolvency, no misleading information, financial statements, no proceedings
pending or threatened, compliance with environmental and other laws, center of main interests and
establishments, pari passu ranking, acquisition documents, certain pre-closing covenants which apply
only until immediately prior to the Closing Date, sanctions, money laundering and anti-corruption laws.

**_Covenants_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain of the incurrence covenants and related
definitions (with certain adjustments) that are set forth in the Indenture, with additional limitations on
debt incurrence by guarantors and the aggregate amount of any Qualified Receivables Financing. In
addition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains a financial covenant, see “—Financial
_Covenant.”_

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also contains a “notes purchase condition” covenant. Subject
to certain exceptions set out in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Company may not, and
shall procure that no other member of the Group will repay, prepay, purchase, defease, redeem or
otherwise acquire or retire the principal amount of the Senior Pari Passu Notes Debt (or any
replacement or refinancing thereof as permitted under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement from
time to time) prior to the termination date in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility in any manner
which involves the payment of cash consideration by any member of the Group to a person which is
not a member of the Group. The exceptions to such covenant include (among other things) payments
made with the proceeds of Available Shareholder Amounts, New Equity or Subordinated Shareholder
Funding, payments following a change of control (provided that the Group is in compliance with its
obligations described in “—Mandatory prepayment”) and payments made in circumstances where the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of Senior Pari Passu Notes Debt immediately following
the relevant notes purchase (i) is or would exceed 50% of the aggregate original principal amount of
the Senior Pari Passu Notes Debt which remain outstanding on or are issued by the Company on the
Issue Date or (ii) is or would be less than 50% of the aggregate original principal amount of all classes
of the Senior Pari Passu Notes Debt in existence on the Issue Date and the commitments under the
Revolving Credit Facility are, or will be, at the time the notes purchase completes, cancelled in the
same proportion as (y) the amount by which the aggregate principal amount then outstanding of the
Senior Pari Passu Notes Debt is less than 50% of the aggregate original principal amount of all classes
of Senior Pari Passu Notes Debt on the Issue Date of that class bears to (z) 50% of the original
aggregate principal amount of the Senior Pari Passu Notes Debt on the Issue Date.

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also requires certain members of the Group to observe certain
covenants, including covenants relating to:

- maintenance of authorizations;

- compliance with laws;

- maintenance of guarantor and security coverage (including as described above) and further
assurances;

- maintenance of insurance;


-----

- payment of taxes;

- preservation of assets;

- center of main interests and establishments;

- anti-corruption laws;

- compliance with sanctions;

- ensuring the maturity of the Senior Pari Passu Notes is no earlier than six months after the
termination date in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility;

- maintenance of pari passu ranking of the Revolving Credit Facility; and

- certain pre-closing covenants which apply only until immediately prior to the Closing Date.

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains an information covenant under which, among other
things, the Company is required to deliver to the facility agent annual financial statements, quarterly
financial statements and compliance certificates.

**_Financial covenant_**

Subject to the paragraph below, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires the Company to
comply with a Drawn Super Senior Leverage Ratio (defined as the ratio of the aggregate principal
amount outstanding under each utilization under the Revolving Credit Facility and each additional
facility (including in each case, the amount outstanding under any letter of credit to the extent such
letter of credit is drawn or a claim has been made thereunder by the relevant beneficiary), together with
all ancillary outstandings (but excluding the aggregate amount of all accrued interest, fees and
commissions in respect of such utilizations, additional facilities and ancillary outstandings) (“Drawn
_Super Senior Indebtedness”) at such date to Consolidated EBITDA for the period of the most recent_
four consecutive financial quarters).

The financial covenant shall only be tested from a date not earlier than the last day of the second full
financial quarter following the Closing Date, only to the extent that a utilization has been requested and,
at any time during the financial quarter ending on the most recent quarter date, the aggregate amount
of all outstanding utilizations and ancillary outstandings under the Revolving Credit Facility was equal
to or greater than 30% of the total commitments on such quarter date. The Drawn Super Senior
Leverage Ratio for any relevant period shall not exceed 2.0:1.0.

The Company is permitted to prevent or cure breaches of the Drawn Super Senior Leverage Ratio by
applying any cure amount (being amounts received by the Company in cash pursuant to any new
equity or permitted subordinated debt) as if Drawn Super Senior Indebtedness had been reduced by
such amount. The portion of such cure amount used to cure a failure to satisfy the Drawn Super Senior
Leverage Ratio is not required to be applied in prepayment of the Revolving Credit Facility and no such
cure amount shall be taken into account for the purposes of the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA.
No more than five cure amounts may be taken into account during the term of the Revolving Credit
Facility and different cure amounts may not be taken into account in successive financial quarters.

**_Events of default_**

The Revolving Credit Facility contains equivalent events of default, with certain adjustments, as those
applicable to the Senior Pari Passu Notes as set forth in the section entitled “—Description of the
_Notes—Events of Default.” In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility contains the following events of_
default:

- failure to satisfy the Drawn Super Senior Leverage Ratio (when tested);

indebtedness in an aggregate amount exceeding €55 million of any obligor due and payable

- unlawfulness, repudiation, rescission, invalidity or unenforceability of the finance documents

provisions of or perform its obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement in any material
respect, if not remedied with 20 business days.

notice (a “Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice”) specifying the event or circumstance
in relation to that Senior Event of Default to the Company, the Security Agent, the Senior
Subordinated Notes Trustee and any Senior Subordinated Creditor Representative until the
earliest of:

(A) the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice;

(B) in relation to payments of the Senior Subordinated Notes liabilities and any Permitted
Subordinated Financing Liabilities, if a Senior Subordinated Standstill Period (as defined
below) is in effect at any time after delivery of that Senior Subordinated Payment Stop
Notice, the date on which that Senior Subordinated Standstill Period expires;

(C) the date on which the relevant Senior Event of Default has been remedied or waived in
accordance with the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Pari Passu Notes Indenture
or any Permitted Senior Financing Agreement (as applicable);

(D) the date on which the Senior Agent which delivered the relevant Senior Subordinated
Payment Stop Notice delivers a notice to the Company, the Security Agent, the Senior
Subordinated Notes Trustee and any Senior Subordinated Creditor Representative
cancelling the Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice;

(E) the Senior Discharge Date; and


-----

(F) the date on which the Security Agent, the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee or any
Senior Subordinated Creditor Representative takes Enforcement Action permitted under
the Intercreditor Agreement against a Debtor.

Notwithstanding the above, a Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice shall not prevent the following
payments:

(i) capitalization of accrued interest under the Senior Subordinated Notes finance documents on its
scheduled date of capitalization;

(ii) fees, costs and expenses reasonably incurred and documented of third party advisors incurred
by the Senior Subordinated Creditors (including legal advice or other appropriate
financial/restructuring advice) in an aggregate amount not exceeding €1 million; and

(iii) following the occurrence of a Senior Event of Default or an event of default under the Senior
Subordinated Notes finance documents (which is continuing), release or discharge of Senior
Subordinated Liabilities in consideration for the issue of shares in the Senior Subordinated Debt
Issuer or any holding company of the Senior Subordinated Debt Issuer and provided that no
cash or cash equivalent payment is made in respect of the Senior Subordinated Liabilities.

Unless the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee and any Senior Subordinated Creditor Representative
waive this requirement, (i) a new Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice may not be delivered
unless and until 360 days have elapsed since the delivery of the immediately prior Senior Subordinated
Payment Stop Notice; and (ii) no Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by a
Senior Agent in reliance on a Senior Event of Default more than 45 days after the date that Senior Agent
received notice of that Senior Event of Default.

The Senior Agents may only serve one Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice with respect to the
same event or set of circumstances. Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, this shall not
affect the right of the Senior Agents to issue a Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice in respect of
any other event or set of circumstances. No Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice may be served
in respect of a Senior Event of Default which had been notified to the Senior Agents (as defined below)
at the time at which an earlier Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice was issued.

Any failure to make a payment due under the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture and any Permitted
Subordinated Financing Documents as a result of the issue of a Senior Subordinated Payment Stop
Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an Event
of Default (as defined in the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture or any Permitted Subordinated
Financing Documents, as applicable) as a consequence of that failure to make a payment in relation
to the relevant Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture and any Permitted Subordinated Financing
Documents; or (ii) the issue of a Senior Subordinated Enforcement Notice (as defined below) on behalf
of the Senior Subordinated Creditors.

**_Payment obligations and capitalization of interest continue_**

Neither the relevant Senior Subordinated Guarantor nor any other Debtor shall be released from the
liability to make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under
the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture and any Permitted Subordinated Financing Document by the
operation of the provisions set out under each section above under the caption “—Restrictions Relating
_to Senior Subordinated Creditors and Senior Subordinated Liabilities” even if its obligation to make_
such payment is restricted at any time by the terms of any of those provisions.

The accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with the Senior Subordinated Notes
Indenture and any Permitted Subordinated Financing Document shall continue notwithstanding the
issue of a Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice.


-----

**_Cure of payment stop_**

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence
of a Senior Payment Default, that Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice ceases to be
outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Payment Default ceases to be continuing;
and

(ii) the relevant Senior Subordinated Guarantor or the relevant Debtor then promptly pays to the
Senior Subordinated Creditors an amount equal to any payments which had accrued under the
Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture and any Permitted Subordinated Financing Document
and which would have been Permitted Senior Subordinated Payments but for that Senior
Subordinated Payment Stop Notice or Senior Payment Default,

then any Event of Default (including any cross default or similar provision under any other debt
document) which may have occurred as a result of that suspension of payments shall be waived, and
any Senior Subordinated Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that Event of
Default shall be waived, in each case without any further action being required on the part of the Senior
Subordinated Creditors or any other Creditor.

**_Restrictions on amendments and waivers_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Senior Subordinated Creditors, the Senior Subordinated
Debt Issuers and the other Debtors may amend or waive the terms of the Senior Subordinated Notes
finance documents and/or the Permitted Subordinated Financing Documents in accordance with their
terms at any time (and subject only to any consent required under them).

**_Restrictions on enforcement by senior subordinated creditors_**

Until the Senior Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing
Group:

(i) no Senior Subordinated Creditor shall direct the Security Agent to enforce, or otherwise require
the enforcement of any security; and

(ii) no Senior Subordinated Creditor shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action in
relation to the guarantees by a member of the Group of any of the obligations of any member of
the Group under the Senior Subordinated Notes finance documents and/or Permitted

to direct such action.

“Enforcement Action” is defined as:

(i) in relation to any liabilities:

(A) the acceleration of any liabilities or the making of any declaration that any liabilities are

(B) the making of any declaration that any liabilities are payable on demand;

(C) the making of a demand in relation to a liability that is payable on demand;

Agreement (or any other similar or equivalent provision of any of the Senior Facility
finance documents, the Senior Pari Passu Notes finance documents, the Permitted Senior
Financing Documents, the hedging agreements regulated by the Intercreditor Agreement,
the Senior Subordinated Notes finance documents and/or the Permitted Subordinated
Financing Documents (the “Secured Debt Documents”) and/or any other acquisition of
liabilities, acquisition or transaction which any member of the Group is not prohibited from
entering into by the terms of the Secured Debt Documents and excluding any mandatory
offer arising as a result of a change of control or asset sale (howsoever described) as set
out in the Senior Pari Passu Notes finance documents or the Senior Subordinated Notes
finance documents (or any other similar or equivalent provision of any of the Secured
Debt Documents);

(F) the exercise of any right of set-off, account combination or payment netting against any
member of the Group in respect of any liabilities other than the exercise of any such right:

(I) as close-out netting by a Hedge Counterparty or by a hedging ancillary lender;

(II) as payment netting by a Hedge Counterparty or by a hedging ancillary lender;

(III) as inter-hedging agreement netting by a Hedge Counterparty;

(IV) as inter-hedging ancillary document netting by a hedging ancillary lender; and/or

(V) which is otherwise not prohibited by the terms of any of the Secured Debt
Documents, in each case to the extent that the exercise of that right gives effect to
a permitted payment; and

(G) the suing for, commencing or joining of any legal or arbitration proceedings against any
member of the Group to recover any liabilities;

(ii) the premature termination or close-out of any hedging transaction under any hedging
agreement (except save to the extent permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement);

indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of the liabilities (other than any action
permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement or any debt buy-back, tender offer, exchange offer
or similar or equivalent arrangement not otherwise prohibited by the debt documents); or

(v) the petitioning, applying or voting for, or the taking of any steps (including the appointment of
any liquidator, receiver, administrator, insolvency administrator or similar officer) in relation to,
the winding up, dissolution administration, opening of insolvency proceedings or reorganization
of any member of the Group which owes any liabilities, or has given any security, guarantee,
indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of any of the liabilities, or any of such
member of the Group’s assets or any suspension of payments or moratorium of any
indebtedness of any such member of the Group, or any analogous procedure or step in any
jurisdiction,

except that the following shall not constitute Enforcement Action:

(A) the taking of any action falling above which is necessary (but only to the extent necessary)
to preserve the validity, existence or priority of claims in respect of liabilities, including the


-----

registration of such claims before any court or governmental authority and the bringing,
supporting or joining of proceedings to prevent any loss of the right to bring, support or
join proceedings by reason of applicable limitation periods; or

(B) a Senior Secured Creditor or Senior Subordinated Creditor (or any related agent) bringing

relief (or any analogous remedy outside England and Wales) to restrain any actual or
putative breach of any debt document to which it is party, (b) obtaining specific
performance (other than specific performance of an obligation to make a payment) with

sale or disposal is to take place pursuant to the powers granted to those persons under
any relevant documentation; or

(E) any person consenting to, or the taking of any other action pursuant to or in connection
with, any merger, consolidation, reorganization or any other similar or equivalent step or
transaction initiated or undertaken by a member of the Group (or any analogous
procedure or step in any jurisdiction) that is not prohibited by the terms of the Secured
Debt Documents to which it is a party.

**_Permitted senior subordinated enforcement_**

The restrictions set out in the caption “—Restrictions on Enforcement by Senior Subordinated
_Creditors” above will not apply to instructions to enforce the Shared Security or the liabilities of the_
Senior Subordinated Guarantors if:

(i) an Event of Default (as defined in the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture and any Permitted
Subordinated Financing Agreement, as applicable, each a “Senior Subordinated Event of
**Default”) (the “Relevant Senior Subordinated Default”) is continuing;**

(ii) each Senior Agent has received a notice of the Relevant Senior Subordinated Default specifying
the event or circumstance in relation to the Relevant Senior Subordinated Default from the
Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee or the Senior Subordinated Creditor Representative, as the
case may be;

(iii) a Senior Subordinated Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(iv) the Relevant Senior Subordinated Default is continuing at the end of the relevant Senior
Subordinated Standstill Period.

Promptly upon becoming aware of a Senior Subordinated Event of Default, the Senior Subordinated
Notes Trustee or the Senior Subordinated Creditor Representative, as the case may be, may by notice
(a “Senior Subordinated Enforcement Notice”) in writing notify the Senior Agents of the existence of
such Senior Subordinated Event of Default.

**_Senior subordinated standstill period_**

In relation to a Relevant Senior Subordinated Default, a Senior Subordinated Standstill Period shall
mean the period beginning on the date (the “Senior Subordinated Standstill Start Date”) the relevant
Senior Agent serves a Senior Subordinated Enforcement Notice on each of the Senior Agents in
respect of such Senior Subordinated Event of Default and ending on the earlier to occur of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after the Senior Subordinated Standstill Start Date;


-----

(ii) the date the Senior Secured Parties take any Enforcement Action in relation to a particular
guarantor of the Senior Subordinated Notes and any Permitted Subordinated Financing Debt (a
“Senior Subordinated Guarantor”), provided, however, that if a Senior Subordinated Standstill
Period ends pursuant to this paragraph, the Senior Subordinated Creditors may only take the
same Enforcement Action in relation to the Senior Subordinated Guarantor as the Enforcement
Action taken by the Senior Secured Parties against such Senior Subordinated Guarantor and not
against any other member of the Group;

(iii) the date of an Insolvency Event in relation to the relevant Senior Subordinated Debt Issuer or a
particular Senior Subordinated Guarantor against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken;

(iv) the expiry of any other Senior Subordinated Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first
mentioned Senior Subordinated Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a
result of a cure, waiver or other permitted remedy);

(v) the date on which the consent of each of the Senior Facility Agent (acting on the instructions of
the Majority Senior Lenders), any Senior Pari Passu Notes Trustee (acting on behalf of the Senior
Pari Passu Note holders) and any Senior Secured Creditor Representative (acting on the
instructions the Majority Permitted Senior Secured Financing Creditors) has been obtained; and

(vi) a failure to pay the principal amount outstanding under the Senior Subordinated Notes or on any
Permitted Subordinated Financing Debt, as the case may be, at the final stated maturity of the
amounts outstanding under the Senior Subordinated Notes or on the Permitted Subordinated
Financing Debt, as the case may be (provided that, unless the Senior Lender Discharge Date
has occurred or as otherwise agreed by the Majority Senior Lenders and the Company, such
final stated maturity has not been amended to fall on a date prior to the date falling 96 months
after the date of the Intercreditor Agreement),

(the “Senior Subordinated Standstill Period”).

**_Subsequent senior subordinated event of default_**

The Senior Subordinated Finance Parties may take Enforcement Action under the provisions set out
under the caption “—Permitted Senior Subordinated Enforcement” above in relation to a Senior
Subordinated Event of Default even if, at the end of any relevant Senior Subordinated Standstill Period
or at any later time, a further Senior Subordinated Standstill Period has begun as a result of any other
Senior Subordinated Event of Default.

**_Enforcement on behalf of senior subordinated creditors_**

If the Security Agent has notified each of the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee and any Senior
Subordinated Creditor Representative (the “Senior Subordinated Agents”) that it is enforcing security
created pursuant to any security document over shares or assets of a Senior Subordinated Guarantor,
no Senior Subordinated Creditor may take any action referred to under the provisions set out under
the caption “—Permitted Senior Subordinated Enforcement” above against that Senior Subordinated
Guarantor (or any subsidiary of that Senior Subordinated Guarantor) while the Security Agent is taking
steps to enforce that security in accordance with the instructions of an Instructing Group where such
action might be reasonably likely to adversely affect such enforcement or the amount of proceeds to
be derived therefrom.

**_Option to Purchase: Senior Subordinated Creditors_**

Subject to the following paragraphs, any of the Senior Subordinated Agents (on behalf of the Senior
Subordinated Creditors) may, after an acceleration event under any of the Senior Facilities Agreement,
the Senior Pari Passu Notes or in relation to any Permitted Senior Secured Financing Debt which is
continuing, by giving not less than 10 days’ notice to the Security Agent, require the transfer to the
Senior Subordinated Creditors of all, but not part, of the rights, benefits and obligations in respect of
the Senior Lender Liabilities, the Senior Pari Passu Notes Liabilities and the Permitted Senior Secured
Financing Liabilities (the “Senior Secured Liabilities”) if:


-----

(i) that transfer is lawful and, subject to paragraph (ii) below, otherwise permitted by the terms of
the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Pari Passu Notes Indenture and any Permitted Senior
Secured Financing Agreement (as applicable);

(ii) any conditions relating to such a transfer contained in the Senior Facilities Agreement (in the
case of the Senior Lender Liabilities), the Senior Pari Passu Notes Indenture (in the case of the
Senior Pari Passu Notes Liabilities) and any Permitted Senior Secured Financing Agreement (in
the case of the Permitted Senior Secured Financing Liabilities) are complied with, in each case,
other than as specified in the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) each of the Senior Facility Agent, on behalf of the Senior Lenders, the Senior Pari Passu Notes
Trustee, on behalf of the relevant Senior Pari Passu Note holders and the applicable Senior
Secured Creditor Representative, on behalf of the relevant Permitted Senior Secured Financing
Creditors, is paid the amounts required under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iv) as a result of that transfer the Senior Lenders, the Senior Pari Passu Note holders and the
Permitted Senior Secured Financing Creditors have no further actual or contingent liability to the
Company or any other Debtor under the relevant Secured Debt Documents;

(v) an indemnity is provided from each Senior Subordinated Creditor (other than any Senior
Subordinated Notes Trustee) (or another acceptable third party) in respect of all costs,
expenses, losses and liabilities which may be sustained or incurred by any Senior Lender,
Senior Pari Passu Note holder or Permitted Senior Secured Financing Creditor in consequence
of any sum received or recovered by any such party from any person being required (or it being
alleged that it is required) to be paid back by or clawed back from any Senior Lender or Senior
Pari Passu Note holder, Permitted Senior Secured Financing Creditor for any reason; and

(vi) the transfer is made without recourse to, or representation or warranty from, the Senior Lenders,
the Senior Pari Passu Note holders or the Permitted Senior Secured Financing, except that each
of them shall be deemed to have represented and warranted on the date of that transfer that it
has the corporate power to effect that transfer and it has taken all necessary action to authorize
the making by it of that transfer.

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, a Senior Subordinated Agent (on behalf of all the Senior
Subordinated Creditors) may only require a transfer of Senior Secured Liabilities if, at the same time,
they require a transfer of Hedging Liabilities regulated by the Intercreditor Agreement and if, for any
reason, such transfer cannot be made in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, no transfer of
Senior Secured Liabilities may be required to be made.

At the request of a Senior Subordinated Agent (on behalf of all the Senior Subordinated Creditors), the
Senior Facility Agent, the Senior Pari Passu Notes Trustee and any relevant Senior Secured Creditor
Representative shall notify the Senior Subordinated Agents of the foregoing payable sums in
connection with such transfer.

**_Effect of insolvency event; filing of claims_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, among other things, after the occurrence of an Insolvency
Event in relation to any Debtor, or, following an acceleration event which is continuing, any member of
the Group, any party entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of that member of the Group in
respect of liabilities owed to that party shall (if prior to a Distress Event, only if required by the Security
Agent arising on the instructions of an Instructing Group), subject to receiving payment instructions
and any other relevant information from the Security Agent and to the extent it is able to do so,
including pursuant to applicable law and regulation, direct the person responsible for the distribution
of the assets of that member of the Group to pay that distribution to the Security Agent until the
liabilities owing to the secured parties have been paid in full. In this respect, the Security Agent shall
apply distributions paid to it in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “—Application
_of proceeds” below._


-----

Subject to certain exceptions, to the extent that any member of the Group’s liabilities are discharged
by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to
that member of the Group and any creditor which benefited from that set-off shall (if prior to a Distress
Event, only if required by the Security Agent arising on the instructions of an Instructing Group),
subject to receiving payment instructions and any other relevant information from the Security Agent,
pay an amount equal to the amount of the liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to
the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out in the caption
“—Application of proceeds” below and subject to certain exceptions.

Subject to the provisions set out in the caption “—Application of proceeds” below, if the Security Agent
or any other secured party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in respect of any of the
liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent that the
realization proceeds are actually applied towards the liabilities.

After the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to any Debtor or, following an acceleration event
which is continuing, any member of the Group and each creditor irrevocably authorizes the Security
Agent, on its behalf, to:

(i) take any Enforcement Action (in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement)
against that member of the Group;

(ii) demand, sue, prove and give receipt for any or all of that member of Group’s liabilities;

(iii) collect and receive all distributions on, or on account of, any or all of that member of Group’s
liabilities; and

(iv) file claims, take proceedings and do all other things the Security Agent considers reasonably
necessary to recover in respect of that member of Group’s liabilities.

Each creditor will (i) do all things that the Security Agent reasonably requests in order to give effect to
the matters referred to in this “—Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims” section and (ii) if the
Security Agent is not entitled to take any of the actions contemplated by this “—Effect of Insolvency
_Event; Filing of Claims” section or if the Security Agent requests that a creditor take that action,_
undertake that action itself in accordance with the instructions of the Security Agent or grant a power
of attorney to the Security Agent (on such terms as the Security Agent may reasonably require,
although the Senior Pari Passu Notes Trustee and the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee shall be
under no obligation to grant such powers of attorney) to enable the Security Agent to take such action.

**_Turnover_**

_Turnover by primary creditors_

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that prior to the Senior Discharge
Date if any Primary Creditor receives or recovers from any member of the Group the proceeds of any
enforcement of any security or, following the occurrence of a Distress Event, proceeds which should
have otherwise been received, recovered or realized by the Security Agent pursuant to the debt
documents, that Primary Creditor will: (i) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or
recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities
(or if less, the amount received or recovered) on trust for the Security Agent and subject to receiving
payment instructions and any other relevant information from the Security Agent, promptly pay that
amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement and (y) subject to receiving payment instructions and any other relevant information the
Security Agent, promptly pay an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery
exceeds the relevant liabilities to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement; and (ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of
set-off, subject to receiving payment instructions and any other relevant information from the Security
Agent, promptly pay an amount equal to that receipt or recovery to the Security Agent for application
in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.


-----

**_Turnover by senior subordinated creditors and subordinated creditors_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that prior to the Senior Discharge
Date if any Senior Subordinated Creditor or prior to the Final Discharge Date, Subordinated Creditor
receives or recovers from any member of the Group (other than the Senior Subordinated Debt Issuer):

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities which is
prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement or is not in accordance with the provisions set out
below the caption “—Application of proceeds”;

(ii) other than as referred to in the second paragraph of the caption “—Effect of Insolvency Event;
_Filing of Claims” any amount by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it which_
does not give effect to a payment permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) other than by way of set-off, any amount:

(A) on account of, or in relation to, any of the Senior Subordinated Notes Liabilities, Permitted
Subordinated Financing Liabilities, Investor Liabilities or Intra-Group Liabilities (x) after the
occurrence of a Distress Event or (y) as a result of any other litigation or proceedings
against a Debtor or a member of the Group (other than after the occurrence of an
insolvency event in respect of that Debtor or that member of the Group) other than, in
each case, any amount received or recovered in accordance with the provisions set out
below the caption “—Application of proceeds”; or

(B) by way of set-off in respect of any of the Senior Subordinated Notes Liabilities, Permitted
Subordinated Financing Liabilities, Investor Liabilities or Intra-Group Liabilities owed to it
after the occurrence of a Distress Event; or

(iv) the proceeds of the enforcement of any transaction security except in accordance with the
provisions set out in the caption “—Application of proceeds”; or

(v) subject to certain exceptions, any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of
or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed by any member of Group which is not in accordance
with the provisions set out in the caption “—Application of proceeds” and which is made as a
result of, or after, the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that member of Group,

that Senior Subordinated Creditor or Subordinated Creditor (as applicable) will, subject to certain
exceptions: (i) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold
an amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received or
recovered) on trust for the Security Agent and subject to receiving payment instructions and any other
relevant information from the Security Agent, promptly pay that amount to the Security Agent for
application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and (y) subject to receiving
payment instructions and any other relevant information from the Security Agent, promptly pay an
amount equal to the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities to
the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (ii)
in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, subject to receiving
payment instructions and any other relevant information from the Security Agent, promptly pay an
amount equal to that receipt or recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Enforcement of security_**

_Enforcement instructions_

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing: (a) the security unless instructed otherwise by (i) an
Instructing Group; or (ii) if required as set out under the fourth paragraph of this section, the Majority
Senior Subordinated Creditors; and (b) the Senior Subordinated Notes Only Security unless instructed
otherwise by the Majority Senior Subordinated Creditors.


-----

Subject to the security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms (i) an Instructing
Group may give or refrain from giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from
enforcing the relevant transaction security as they see fit provided that the instructions as to
Enforcement given by the Instructing Group are consistent with the security enforcement principles set
out therein (the “Security Enforcement Principles”); or (ii) to the extent permitted to enforce or to
require the enforcement of the Shared Security prior to the Senior Discharge Date under the provisions
under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to Senior Subordinated Creditors and Senior Subordinated
_Liabilities” above, the Majority Senior Subordinated Creditors may give or refrain from giving_
instructions to the Security Agent to enforce, or refrain from enforcing, the security as they see fit.

Subject to the Senior Subordinated Notes Only Security having become enforceable in accordance
with its terms the Majority Senior Subordinated Creditors may give or refrain from giving instructions
to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from enforcing the Senior Subordinated Notes Only Security
as they see fit.

Prior to the Senior Discharge Date, (i) if an Instructing Group has instructed the Security Agent not to
enforce or to cease enforcing the security or (ii) in the absence of instructions from an Instructing
Group, and, in each case, an Instructing Group has not required any Debtor to make a distressed
disposal, the Security Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the Shared Security which
the Majority Senior Subordinated Creditors are then entitled to give to the Security Agent under the
provisions under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to Senior Subordinated Creditors and Senior
_Subordinated Liabilities” above._

Subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, no secured party shall have any
independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to, any security or to exercise any rights or powers
arising under the security documents except through the Security Agent.

_Manner of enforcement_

If the security is being enforced as set forth above under the caption “—Enforcement Instructions,” the
Security Agent shall enforce the security in such manner (including, without limitation, the selection of
any administrator or equivalent officer of any Debtor to be appointed by the Security Agent) as:

(i) an Instructing Group shall instruct, provided that such instructions are consistent with the
Security Enforcement Principles or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security
Agent considers in its discretion to be appropriate and consistent with the Security Enforcement
Principles; or

(ii) prior to the Senior Discharge Date and only insofar as the security concerned is Shared Security,
if (i) the Security Agent has, pursuant to the fourth paragraph of this “—Enforcement of Security”
section, given effect to instructions given by the Majority Senior Subordinated Creditors to
enforce the Shared Security and (ii) an Instructing Group has not given instructions as to the
manner of enforcement of the security, the Majority Senior Subordinated Creditors shall instruct
or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit provided that, the
consent of the Senior Creditor Representative representing an Instructing Group is required if
any such instructions are given by the Majority Senior Subordinated Creditors and are not in
accordance with the Security Enforcement Principles.

In the event that following receipt of instructions from an Instructing Group (an “Initial Enforcement
**Notice”) conflicting enforcement instructions are received by the Security Agent or no instructions are**
received from Senior Secured Creditors entitled to give such instructions as an Instructing Group, the
Security Agent shall enforce the security, refrain or cease from enforcing the security or, as the case
may be, take the relevant other Enforcement Action in accordance with the instructions given the
holders of more than 50% of the total “Senior Secured Credit Participations,” being the aggregate of
all outstanding liabilities under certain hedging liabilities, the Senior Pari Passu Notes (to the extent the
Company has agreed that the relevant Senior Pari Passu Notes are to benefit from any transaction
security, the principal amount of outstanding Senior Pari Passu Notes Liabilities held by that Senior Pari
Passu Noteholder) and any other indebtedness sharing the transaction security on a first-ranking basis


-----

other than the Super Priority Creditors (in each case provided that such instructions are consistent with
any applicable requirements of the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents) and the terms
of all instructions given by any other Instructing Group shall be deemed revoked.

If, prior to the Senior Lender Discharge Date:

(i) the Super Priority Creditors have not been fully repaid within six months of the date on which the
Initial Enforcement Notice was received;

(ii) the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement of the transaction security (or a
transaction in lieu thereof) or other Enforcement Action within three months of the date on which
the Initial Enforcement Notice was received; or

(iii) an Insolvency Event has occurred and the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement
of the transaction security (or a transaction in lieu thereof) or other Enforcement Action at that
time,

then the Security Agent shall follow the instructions given by the Majority Super Priority Creditors (in
each case provided that such instructions are consistent with any applicable requirements of the
Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents).

_Exercise of voting rights_

To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, each Subordinated Creditor shall agree with the
Security Agent that it will cast its vote in any proposal put to the vote by, or under the supervision of,
any judicial or supervisory authority in respect of any insolvency, pre-insolvency or rehabilitation or
similar proceedings relating to any member of the Group as instructed by the Security Agent. The
Security Agent shall give instructions for the purposes of this paragraph as directed by an Instructing
Group or, in the case of the Senior Subordinated Debt Issuer, the Majority Senior Subordinated
Creditors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party can exercise or require any other creditor under the
Intercreditor Agreement to exercise its power of voting or representation to waive, reduce, discharge,
extend the due date for payment or otherwise reschedule any of the liabilities owed to that creditor.

_Waiver of rights_

To the extent permitted under applicable law and subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement, each of the secured parties and the Debtors waives all rights it may otherwise have to
require that the security or the Senior Subordinated Notes Only Security be enforced in any particular
order or manner or at any particular time, or that any sum received or recovered from any person, or
by virtue of the enforcement of any of the security or the Senior Subordinated Notes Only Security or
of any other security interest, which is capable of being applied in or towards discharge of any of the
secured obligations, is so applied.

_Security held by other creditors_

If any security is held by a creditor other than the Security Agent, then that creditor may only enforce
that security in accordance with instructions given by an Instructing Group pursuant to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement (and for this purpose references to the Security Agent shall be construed as
references to that creditor).

_Senior Subordinated Notes Only Security_

The Senior Subordinated Notes Creditors or an agent acting on their behalf may enforce the Senior
Subordinated Notes Only Security as provided for under the relevant Senior Subordinated Notes
Finance Documents.

_Duties owed_

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, each of the secured parties and the Debtors acknowledges
that, in the event that the Security Agent enforces, or is instructed to enforce, the security prior to the


-----

Senior Discharge Date, the duties of the Security Agent and of any receiver or delegate owed to any
Secured Parties in respect of the method, type and timing of that enforcement or of the exploitation,
management or realization of any of that security shall (subject to certain exceptions) be no different
to or greater than the duty that is owed by the Security Agent, receiver or delegate to the Debtors under
general law.

**_Proceeds of disposals_**

_Non-distressed disposals_

The Security Agent is irrevocably authorized and instructed (at the request and cost of the relevant
Debtor or the Company) to promptly release (or procure that any other relevant person releases):

(i) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any asset which is the
subject of:

(A) a disposal not prohibited by the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Pari
Passu Notes Indenture, any Permitted Senior Secured Financing Agreement, the Senior
Subordinated Notes Indenture and any Permitted Subordinated Financing Agreement
(each a “Debt Financing Agreement”) (including a disposal to a member of the Group,
but without prejudice to any obligation of any member of the Group in a Debt Financing
Agreement to provide replacement security); or

(B) any other transaction not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement
pursuant to which that asset will cease to be held or owned by a member of the Group;

(ii) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any document or
agreement in order for any member of the Group to effect any amendment or waiver in respect
of that document or agreement or otherwise exercise any rights, comply with any obligations or
take any action in relation to that document or agreement (in each case to the extent not
prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement);

(iii) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any asset of any member
of the Group which has ceased to be a Debtor; and

(iv) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any other asset to the
extent that such release is in accordance with the terms of the Debt Financing Agreements.

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor (or any holding company
of any Debtor), or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor (or any holding company of any
Debtor) will cease to be a member of the Group or a Debtor, the Security Agent (on behalf of itself and
the Secured Parties (as defined below)) shall (at the request and cost of the relevant Debtor or the
Company) promptly release (or procure the release of) that Debtor and its subsidiaries from all present
and future liabilities under the Secured Debt Documents.

When making any request for a release pursuant to this “—Non-Distressed Disposals” section, the
Company shall confirm in writing to the Security Agent that:

(A) in the case of any release requested pursuant to paragraph (i) or (ii) above, the relevant disposal
or other action is not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement; or

(B) in the case of any release requested pursuant to paragraph (iv) above, the relevant release is in
accordance with terms of the Debt Financing Agreements,

and the Security Agent shall be entitled to rely on that confirmation for all purposes under the Secured
Debt Documents.


-----

In the case of any release of security requested by the Company pursuant to the applicable provisions
of the Senior Facilities Agreement as part of a permitted transaction under the Senior Facilities
Agreement, when making that request the Company shall confirm to the Security Agent that:

(i) such request is a permitted transaction request (and absent any such statement in a request for
a release the Security Agent shall be entitled to assume for all purposes that such request is not
a permitted transaction request); and

(ii) it has determined in good faith (taking into account any applicable legal limitations and other
relevant considerations in relation to that permitted transaction) that it is either not possible or
not desirable to implement that permitted transaction on terms satisfactory to the Company by
instead granting additional security and/or amending the terms of the existing security,

and the Security Agent shall be entitled to rely on that confirmation for all purposes under the Secured
Debt Documents.

The Security Agent shall (at the cost and expense of the relevant Debtor or the Company but without
the need for any further consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Creditor or
Debtor) promptly enter into and deliver such documentation and/or take such other action as the
Company (acting reasonably) shall require to give effect to any release or other matter described
above.

If any member of the Group is required or not prohibited under the senior debt documents to apply the
proceeds of any disposal or other transaction in prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or
reduction of the Senior Lender Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities, the Senior Pari Passu Notes Liabilities
or the Permitted Senior Secured Financing Liabilities (as applicable) (together, the “Senior Liabilities”)
then no such application of those proceeds shall require the consent of any other party or result in any
breach of any Senior Subordinated Finance Documents and such application shall discharge in full
any obligation to apply those proceeds in prepayment, redemption or other discharge or reduction of
any Senior Subordinated Liabilities.

_Distressed disposals_

A “Distressed Disposal” is a disposal of an asset which is (a) being effected at the request of an
Instructing Group in circumstances where the security has become enforceable in accordance with the
terms of the relevant security documents, (b) being effected by enforcement of security in accordance
with the terms of the relevant security documents or (c) being disposed of to a third party subsequent
to a Distress Event.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at
the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Company and without any consent, sanction, authority or further
confirmation from any creditor or Debtor):

(i) to release the security or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver or enter into
any release of that security or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any floating
charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be considered
necessary or desirable;

(ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release:

(A) that Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing liabilities,
its guarantee liabilities and its other liabilities;

(B) any security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over any of its assets;
and

(C) any other claim of an investor, an intra-group lender, or another Debtor over that Debtor’s
assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor,

on behalf of the relevant creditors, Debtors and agents;


-----

(iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a
Debtor, to release:

(A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of
its borrowing liabilities, its guarantees liabilities and its other liabilities;

(B) any security granted by that holding company or any subsidiary of that holding company
over any of its assets; and

(C) any other claim of any investor, any intra-group lender or another Debtor over that holding
company’s assets or the assets of any subsidiary of that holding company,

on behalf of the relevant creditors, Debtors and agents;

(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities or the Debtor liabilities owed by
that Debtor or holding company or any subsidiary of that Debtor or holding company:

(A) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not
intend that any transferee of those liabilities or Debtor liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be
treated as a Primary Creditor or the Security Agent, any receiver or delegate and each of
the agents, the arrangers, the Senior Secured Creditors and the Senior Subordinated
Creditors (each a “Secured Party”) for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement), to
execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities
or Debtor liabilities, _provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of any debt_
document, the Transferee shall not be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for
the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(B) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend
that any Transferee will be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the
purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement), to execute and deliver or enter into any
agreement to dispose of: all (and not part only) of the liabilities owed to the Primary
Creditors and all or part of any other liabilities and the Debtor liabilities,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors and Debtors;

(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with
the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all
or any part of the Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of any subsidiary of that
Disposed Entity in respect of the intra-group liabilities or the Debtor liabilities, to execute and
deliver or enter into any agreement to:

(A) agree to the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group
liabilities or Debtor liabilities on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to
which those obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those
obligations; and

(B) (if the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also a
guarantor of Senior Liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in
respect of those intra-group liabilities or Debtor liabilities on behalf of the Receiving Entity
or Receiving Entities to which the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or
Debtor liabilities are to be transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities or
Debtor liabilities) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions
set out under the caption “—Application of proceeds” as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an


-----

enforcement of the security and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities or Debtor liabilities has
occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities or Debtor liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities) effected by, or at the request of, the
Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), the Security Agent shall take
reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions (though the Security
Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities
in order to achieve a higher price).

Where borrowing liabilities in respect of any Senior Liabilities would otherwise be released pursuant to
the Intercreditor Agreement, the creditor concerned may elect to have those borrowing liabilities
transferred to the Company in which case the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (to the extent
legally possible and at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Company and without any consent,
sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor) to execute such documents as
are required to so transfer those borrowing liabilities.

Subject to the immediately following paragraph, in the case of a Distressed Disposal effected by or at
the request of the Security Agent, unless the consent of each Senior Agent is otherwise obtained, it is
a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal that the proceeds of such disposal are in cash
(or substantially all in cash) except to the extent contemplated by the Security Enforcement Principles
and such sale or disposal is made pursuant to a Public Auction in respect of which the Primary
Creditors are entitled to participate or where a Financial Adviser has delivered an opinion in respect of
such sale or disposal that the amount received in connection therewith is fair from a financial point of
view. The Primary Creditors shall be entitled to receive access to any valuation report commissioned
by a member of the Group in connection with any Public Auction (provided access is given to the other
Primary Creditors at the same time).

If prior to the discharge date for the Senior Subordinated Notes or any Permitted Subordinated
Financing Debt, a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that the Senior Subordinated Notes
Guarantees and the guarantees of any Permitted Subordinated Financing Debt or any security over the
assets of a Senior Subordinated Debt Issuer or any Senior Subordinated Guarantor will be released
and/or the Senior Subordinated Notes liabilities and any Permitted Subordinated Financing Liabilities
will be released or disposed of, it is a further condition to the release that either:

(i) the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee and any Senior Subordinated Creditor Representative
has approved the release; or

(ii) where shares or assets of a Senior Subordinated Guarantor or assets of the Senior
Subordinated Debt Issuer are sold:

(A) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash);

(B) all claims of the Senior Secured Creditors against a member of the Group (if any), all of
whose shares (other than any minority interest not owned by members of the Group) are
sold or disposed of pursuant to such Distressed Disposal, are unconditionally released
and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and are not assumed
by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all security under the security documents in
respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is simultaneously and unconditionally
released and discharged concurrently with such sale, provided that, if each Senior Agent
(acting reasonably and in good faith):

(I) determines that the Senior Secured Creditors will recover a greater amount if such
claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or one of its affiliates and not
released or discharged; and

(II) serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming the same,

the Security Agent shall be entitled to sell or otherwise transfer such claim to the
purchaser or one of its affiliates; and


-----

(C) such sale or disposal is made:

(I) pursuant to a Public Auction in respect of which the Primary Creditors are entitled
to participate; or

(II) where a Financial Adviser has delivered an opinion in respect of such sale or
disposal that the amount received in connection therewith is fair from a financial
point of view.

**_Senior Subordinated Distressed Disposals_**

If a Senior Subordinated Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is
irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the Investors and without any consent, sanction, authority or
further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor):

(i) to release the Senior Subordinated Notes Only Security or any other claim over that asset and
execute and deliver or enter into any release of that security or claim and issue any letters of
non-crystallization of any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of
the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority Senior Subordinated Creditors), be
considered necessary or desirable;

(ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of the Company, to release the
Company and any of its subsidiaries from all or any part of its Investor Liabilities on behalf of the
Investors;

(iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of the
Company, to release:

(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of the Company or a holding
company of the Company and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to dispose of all or any part of the Investor Liabilities owed by the Company
or holding company or any subsidiary of the Company or holding company to execute and
deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all or part of those Investor Liabilities on behalf
of, in each case, the Investors.

The net proceeds of each Senior Subordinated Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any
disposal of Investor Liabilities) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with
the provisions set out under the caption “—Application of proceeds” as if those proceeds were the
proceeds of an enforcement of the Senior Subordinated Notes Only Security and, to the extent that
any disposal of Investor Liabilities has occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities or Investor Liabilities
had not occurred.

In the case of a Senior Subordinated Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of Investor Liabilities) effected
by, or at the request of, the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), the
Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market
conditions (though the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone any such Senior
Subordinated Notes Distressed Disposal or disposal of Investor Liabilities in order to achieve a higher
price).

_Debt refinancing_

The Intercreditor Agreement permits any of the liabilities under the debt documents to be refinanced,
replaced, increased or otherwise restructured in whole or in part including by way of Permitted Senior
Financing Debt and/or Permitted Subordinated Financing Debt or the issue of additional Senior Pari
Passu Notes and/or additional Senior Subordinated Notes (a “Debt Refinancing”). Each party to the
Intercreditor Agreement shall, subject to any contrary provision of the Secured Debt Documents, be
required to enter into any amendment to or replacement of the then current Secured Debt Documents
and/or take such other action as is required by the Company in order to facilitate such a Debt
Refinancing including changes to, the taking of, or release and retake of, any guarantee or security,
subject to certain conditions. At the option of the Company, a Debt Refinancing (i) may be made
available on a basis which is senior to, pari passu with or junior to any of the other liabilities, (ii) shall
be entitled to benefit from all or any of the security, (iii) may be made available on a secured or
unsecured basis (subject to certain restrictions) and (iv) may be effected in whole or in part by way of
a debt exchange, non-cash rollover or other similar or equivalent transaction, in each case unless

Agreement, each agent, each Secured Party and each Primary Creditor agrees that it shall co-operate
with the Company, each other member of the Group and each agent in order to facilitate any Debt
Refinancing (including by way of, at the request and cost of the Company, executing any document or
agreement and/or giving instructions to any person). In the event of any refinancing or replacement of
all or any part of the Senior Lender Liabilities (or any such refinancing or replacement indebtedness
from time to time), the Company shall be entitled to require that the definition of Instructing Group is
amended such that the relevant refinancing or replacement indebtedness is treated in the same
manner as the Senior Facility (meaning that for the purpose of calculating the voting entitlement of any
person, at the option of the Company all or any part of the relevant refinancing or replacement
indebtedness may be treated as Senior Pari Passu Credit Participations of the Super Priority Creditors
and not Senior Pari Passu Notes/Permitted Financing Credit Participations).

_Required consents_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, it and/or a security document
may be amended or waived only with the written consent of:

Subordinated Notes Trustee (acting on the instructions of the requisite Senior Subordinated
Note holders);

(v) if any Permitted Subordinated Financing Debt has been incurred and the Proposed Amendment
is prohibited by the terms of the relevant Permitted Subordinated Financing Agreement, the

Financing Creditors);

(vi) if a Hedge Counterparty is providing hedging to a Debtor under a hedging agreement, that
Hedge Counterparty (in each case only to the extent that the relevant amendment or waiver
adversely affects the continuing rights and/or obligations of that Hedge Counterparty and is an
amendment or waiver which is expressed to require the consent of that Hedge Counterparty
under the applicable hedging agreement, as notified by the Company to the Security Agent at
the time of the relevant amendment or waiver);

(vii) the Investors; and

(viii) the Company.

Any amendment or waiver of any Secured Debt Document that is made or effected in connection with
any Debt Refinancing (see “—Debt Refinancing”), any incurrence of additional and/or refinancing debt
(as referred to in “—Ranking and Priority—Additional and/or Refinancing Debt”) or Non-Distressed
Disposal (see “—Proceeds of disposals—Non-Distressed Disposals”) or in connection with any other
provision of any Secured Debt Document (provided that such amendment or waiver is not expressly
prohibited by the terms of any other Secured Debt Document) is binding on all parties to the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement or a security document may be amended by the Company and the
Security Agent without the consent of any other party, to cure defects or omissions, resolve ambiguities
or inconsistencies or reflect changes in each case of a minor, technical or administrative nature or as
otherwise for the benefit of all or any of the Secured Parties. Any amendment, waiver or consent which
relates only to the rights or obligations applicable to creditors under a particular Debt Financing
Agreement (and which does not materially and adversely affect the rights or interests of creditors under
other Debt Financing Agreements) may be approved with only the consent of the agent in respect of
that Debt Financing Agreement and the Company.

_Amendments and waivers: security documents_

Subject to the paragraph below and to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement and
unless the provisions of any debt document expressly provide otherwise, the Security Agent may, if
authorized by an Instructing Group, and if the Company consents, amend the terms of, waive any of
the requirements of or grant consents under, any of the security documents which shall be binding on
each party.

Subject to the second and third paragraphs of the section captioned “—Exceptions” below, any
amendment or waiver of, or consent under, any security document which would adversely affect the
nature or scope of the charged property or the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the
security are distributed requires approval as set out under the section captioned “—Required
_Consents.”_


-----

_Exceptions_

Subject to the following paragraph of this “—Exceptions” section, an amendment, waiver or consent
which adversely relates to the express rights or obligations of an agent, an arranger or the Security
Agent (in each case in such capacity) may not be effected without the consent of that agent, that
arranger or the Security Agent (as the case may be) at such time.

The foregoing shall not apply:

(i) to any release of security and/or Senior Subordinated Notes Only Security, claim or liabilities; or

(ii) to any consent,

which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in accordance with the provisions set out in the caption
“—Proceeds of Disposals” above.

The first paragraph of this “—Exceptions” section shall apply to an arranger only to the extent that the
arranger liabilities are then owed to that arranger.

_Agreement to override_

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement
overrides anything in the debt documents to the contrary.

_Guarantees_

The Intercreditor Agreement additionally provides for Hedge Counterparties to receive guarantees and
indemnities from the Debtors on substantially the same terms (including the relevant limitations) as
such guarantees and indemnities are provided by the obligors to the finance parties under the Senior
Facilities Agreement.

_Equalization_

Permitted Senior Secured Financing Liabilities remain unpaid after the enforcement date and the
application of Recoveries and the resulting losses are not borne by the Senior Pari Passu Notes
Creditors or Permitted Senior Secured Financing Creditors in the proportions which their respective
exposures at the enforcement date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the Senior Pari Passu Notes

**Intrum Justitia Existing MTNs**

In February 2012, Intrum Justitia established a Swedish law MTN program (the “MTN Program”) under
which Intrum Justitia has issued, and may in the future issue, unsecured medium term notes (the
“Intrum Justitia Existing MTNs”). Swedbank AB (publ) is the lead arranger under the MTN Program.
The aggregate total nominal amount of Intrum Justitia Existing MTNs outstanding under the MTN
Program may not exceed SEK 5,000 million. Intrum Justitia has Intrum Justitia Existing MTNs
outstanding as of March 31, 2017 in an aggregate amount of SEK 2,000 million. The Intrum Justitia
Existing MTNs are senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer and are not guaranteed by any of its
subsidiaries.

The Intrum Justitia Existing MTNs may be issued with fixed, floating or zero coupon rate. The terms
and conditions of the MTN Program contain customary restrictions, _inter alia, on security and_
guarantees, prohibiting the Issuer from providing security or guarantees (or permitting any group
company or other entity to provide security or guarantees) for market loans (including any debt


-----

securities, loans or commercial paper that are sold or placed in an organized form and can be traded
on an exchange) issued by it, its subsidiaries or any other person. Further, the terms and conditions of
the MTN Program contain customary events of default such as, inter alia, cross-default (limited to loans
exceeding €5 million), insolvency and mergers where the Issuer is not the surviving entity, the
occurrence of which would enable the issuing agent to, by written notice, declare the loans and any
accrued interest due and payable immediately, or on such later date as the issuing agent may decide.

The Intrum Justitia Existing MTNs issued on June 28, 2013 (the “2013 MTNs”) mature in June 2018
and the Intrum Justitia Existing MTNs issued on May 15, 2014 (the “2014 MTNs”) mature in May 2019.
The Intrum Justitia Existing MTNs may not be voluntarily prepaid prior to their respective maturity
dates. The 2013 MTNs bear interest at a floating rate of STIBOR plus a margin of 2.22% per annum.
The 2014 MTNs consist of two tranches. A portion of the 2014 MTNs bear interest at a floating rate of
STIBOR plus a margin of 1.60% per annum, whereas a portion of the 2014 MTNs bear interest at a fixed
rate of 3.125% per annum.

The Intrum Justitia Existing MTNs are listed on Nasdaq Stockholm in accordance with the final terms
of the respective Intrum Justitia Existing MTNs. The most recent prospectus for the MTN Program was
registered with and approved by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (Sw. Finansinspektionen)
on 3 June 2016 in accordance with the Swedish Financial Instruments Act (Sw. _lag (1991:980) om_
_handel med finansiella instrument)._

**Intrum Justitia Existing Private Placement Notes**

In June 2016, Intrum Justitia issued €160 million bonds (the “Intrum Justitia Existing Private
**Placement Notes”) through a private placement with AB Svensk Exportkredit (“AB SEK”) (the**
“Private Placement”). The Intrum Justitia Existing Private Placement Notes are senior unsecured
obligations of the Issuer and are not guaranteed by any of its subsidiaries.

The terms and conditions of the Intrum Justitia Existing Private Placement Notes contain customary
restrictions, inter alia, on security and guarantees, prohibiting Intrum Justitia from providing security or
guarantees (or permitting any group company or other entity to provide security or guarantees) for
market loans (including any debt securities, loans or commercial paper that are sold or placed in an
organized form and can be traded on an exchange) issued by it, its subsidiaries or any other person.
Further, the terms and conditions of the Intrum Justitia Existing Private Placement Notes contain
customary events of default such as, inter alia, cross-default (limited to loans exceeding €5 million),
insolvency and mergers where the Issuer is not the surviving entity, the occurrence of which would
enable the issuing agent to, by written notice, declare the loans and any accrued interest due and
payable immediately, or on such later date as the issuing agent may decide.

Furthermore, Intrum Justitia and AB SEK have, in connection with the Private Placement, entered into
a side letter stipulating, inter alia, that certain financial covenants included in the Intrum Justitia Existing
Revolving Credit Facility (or any agreement replacing the Intrum Justitia Existing Revolving Credit
Facility) shall apply also to the Intrum Justitia Existing Private Placement Notes. Accordingly, following
the effectiveness of the Revolving Credit Facility, AB SEK will benefit from the same financial covenants
included in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. See “—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.”

The Intrum Justitia Existing Private Placement Notes mature in June 2023 and may not be voluntarily
prepaid prior to their maturity date. The Intrum Justitia Existing Private Placement Notes bear interest
at a floating rate of EURIBOR (3 months) plus a margin on commercial and competitive terms.

**Intrum Justitia Existing Commercial Paper**

In 2011, the Issuer established a Swedish law commercial paper program (the “Intrum Justitia
**Existing Commercial Paper Program”) under which the Issuer has issued, and may in the future**
issue, unsecured commercial paper (“Intrum Justitia Existing Commercial Paper”). Nordea Bank AB
(publ) and Swedbank AB (publ) are the issuing agents under the Intrum Justitia Existing Commercial
Paper Program. The aggregate total nominal amount of Intrum Justitia Existing Commercial Paper


-----

outstanding under the Intrum Justitia Existing Commercial Paper Program may not exceed SEK 1,500
million. As of March 31, 2017, the Issuer has Intrum Justitia Existing Commercial Paper outstanding in

unsecured obligation of the Issuer and is not guaranteed by any of its subsidiaries.

The terms and conditions of the Intrum Justitia Existing Commercial Paper Program contain customary
restrictions, _inter alia, on security and guarantees, prohibiting the Issuer from providing security or_
guarantees (or permitting any group company or other entity to provide security or guarantees) for
market loans (including any debt securities, loans or commercial paper that are sold or placed in an
organized form and can be traded on an exchange) issued by it, its subsidiaries or any other person.
Further, the terms and conditions of the Intrum Justitia Existing Commercial Paper contain customary
events of default such as, inter alia, cross-default (limited to loans exceeding €5 million), insolvency
and insolvency proceedings, the occurrence of which would enable the issuing agents to, by written
notice by noteholders representing at least 10% of the total adjusted nominal amount, declare the
loans and any accrued interest due and payable immediately.

The Intrum Justitia Existing Commercial Paper is frequently issued with an average term of three
months, though the term may vary between one and 12 months. The Intrum Justitia Existing
Commercial Paper bears interest at an average all-in rate of 0.28% per annum.

**Lindorff Existing Loan Note Issuance Deed**

On June 28, 2016, Lock AS, as parent, and certain of its subsidiaries and Lindorff Payment Services
AB, as issuer, entered into a loan note issuance deed (the “Lindorff Existing Loan Note Issuance
**Deed”) with Nordea Bank AB (Publ) as facility agent and security trustee (the “Loan Notes Security**
**Trustee”) pursuant to which Lindorff Payment Services AB issues senior notes (“Senior Payment**
**Services Notes”) to Nordea Bank Norge ASA (as “Initial Senior Noteholder”) and junior notes**
(“Junior Payment Services Notes”) to certain subsidiaries of Lock AS (together the “Initial Junior
**Noteholders”) to finance the purchase by Lindorff Payment Services AB from Lindorff Invest OY,**
Lindorff Sverige AB and any other additional originator (together, the “Originators”), from time to time,
of certain receivables and consumer loans (“Consumer Loans”) in accordance with the terms of
certain receivables purchase agreements between the relevant Originator and Lindorff Payment
Services AB.

The underlying receivables from the Consumer Loans are provided as security in respect of the notes
together with security over the bank accounts in which the receivables from the Consumer Loans are
held. The shares in Lindorff Payment Services AB are also secured in respect of the notes.

Senior Payment Services Notes may be issued in an amount up to the lesser of €50 million and 70%
of the borrowing base specified in a weekly report delivered on the weekly calculation date
immediately prior to the relevant settlement date (the “Senior Facility Limit”). Junior Payment Services
Notes may be issued in an amount up to €80 million in aggregate (the “Junior Facility Limit” and,
together with the Senior Facility Limit, the “Facility Limits”). As of March 31, 2017 the principal amount
of external debt incurred under the Lindorff Existing Loan Note Issuance Deed was €32 million, which
was all in the form of outstanding Senior Payment Services Notes.

The Lindorff Existing Loan Note Issuance Deed sets out mechanisms for determining redemption
amounts (to be paid to the relevant noteholder) and for making “utilizations” (including by way of
issuing additional notes subject to certain conditions being met). These mechanisms facilitate ongoing
compliance with the Facility Limits and help maintain sufficient funding for Lindorff Payment Services
AB.

The Lindorff Existing Loan Note Issuance Deed contains customary and deal specific representations
and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants. The covenants, representations and warranties are
affirmed on each settlement date (being the third business day after each weekly calculation date).


-----

Notes bear interest at a constant rate of:

- the higher of (i) an agreed reference rate depending on the currency (e.g., EURIBOR) and (ii)
the cost of funds; plus a margin of 2.9% per annum, in respect of the Senior Payment Services
Notes; and

- 12% per annum, in respect of the Junior Payment Services Notes.

The Lindorff Existing Loan Note Issuance Deed contains certain events of default, the occurrence of
which would enable the Loan Notes Security Trustee to submit an enforcement notice, upon delivery
of which the Senior Payment Services Notes and Junior Payment Services Notes shall immediately
become due and payable. Upon delivery by the Loan Notes Security Trustee of such an enforcement
notice upon the occurrence of an event of default, the security package becomes enforceable subject
to the provisions of the security documents.

The Lindorff Existing Loan Note Issuance Deed also contains customary and deal specific termination
events, including but not limited to, non-payment, breach of obligations and a change of control.

Subject to a termination event occurring, the Lindorff Existing Loan Note Issuance Deed matures on or
around August 6, 2022 (being 74 months after the initial funding date).

The Notes will be issued by Intrum Justitia AB (publ), a company incorporated in Sweden (the
“Issuer”).

In this “Description of the Notes”, the “Issuer” refers only to Intrum Justitia AB (publ), and any
successor obligor to Intrum Justitia AB (publ) under the Indenture, and not to any of its Subsidiaries.

Pending consummation of the Acquisition and the satisfaction of certain other conditions as described
below, the initial purchasers will, concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Notes on the Issue
Date, deposit the gross proceeds of this offering of the Notes into separate segregated escrow
accounts for each series (collectively, the “Escrow Accounts”) pursuant to the terms of an escrow deed
(the “Escrow Agreement”) dated as of the Issue Date among, _inter alios, the Issuer, Citibank, N.A.,_
London Branch, as trustee (the “Trustee”) and Citibank, N.A., London Branch, as Notes Escrow Agent
(the “Escrow Agent”). If the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to July 31, 2017 (the “Escrow
_Longstop Date”), the Notes will be redeemed at a price equal to 100% of their respective initial issue_
price plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date to the Special Mandatory
Redemption Date (as defined below) and Additional Amounts, if any. See “—Escrow of Proceeds;

Accounts or in the Escrowed Property (as defined below).

The proceeds of the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used by the Issuer, directly or
indirectly, (i) to refinance certain existing indebtedness of the Target Group and of the Issuer, including
the payment of break fees and certain debt prepayment premiums and (ii) to pay fees, costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions, as set forth in this Offering Memorandum under
the caption “Use of Proceeds.”

The Issuer will issue the Notes under an indenture, to be dated as of the Issue Date (the “Indenture”),
among, inter alios, the Issuer and the Trustee. The Notes will be issued in private transactions that are
not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.” The terms
of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture. The Indenture will not be qualified under, and will
not incorporate any provision of, or be subject to the terms of, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended. The Notes are subject to all such terms pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, and
Holders of the Notes are referred to the Indenture for a statement thereof.

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture, the Escrow Agreement and the
Notes and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement and does not purport to be complete and is subject
to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, all provisions of the Indenture, the Escrow Agreement,
the Notes and the Intercreditor Agreement, respectively. Because this is a summary, it may not contain
all the information that is important to you. You should read the Indenture, the Escrow Agreement and
the Intercreditor Agreement in their entirety. Copies of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement
are available as described under “Listing and General Information—Admission to Trading and Listing.”
You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description under “—Certain Definitions.”


-----

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. In general, only
registered Holders will have rights under the Indenture.

**Brief Description of the Notes**

**The Notes**

The Notes offered hereby:

- will be senior obligations of the Issuer and will rank equal in right of payment with all of the
Issuer’s existing and future obligations that are not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes,
including obligations under the RCF Facility Agreement, certain Hedging Obligations, the MTNs,
the Private Placement Notes and the Commercial Paper Program;

- will be senior in right of payment to any Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer;

- will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured Indebtedness of the Issuer,
including obligations under the RCF Facility Agreement, to the extent of the value of the property
and assets securing such Indebtedness; and

- will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that are not
Guarantors, including such subsidiaries’ obligations under the RCF Facility Agreement.

Initially, none of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will Guarantee the Notes and the Issuer will not have any
obligation to cause any of its Subsidiaries to Guarantee the Notes in the future (except as required
under the circumstances described below under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries; Future Guarantors”)._

Substantially all the operations of the Issuer are conducted through its Subsidiaries. Claims of creditors
of non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt
and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if
any) of those Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those
Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and any Guarantor, including Holders of the
Notes. The Notes and any Guarantee thereof will be effectively subordinated to creditors (including
trade creditors and the obligations under the RCF Facility Agreement and certain Hedging Obligations)
and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than any
Guarantor). As of March 31, 2017, after giving effect to the Transactions, the Issuer’s Subsidiaries
would have had no external debt, including interest-bearing notes, loans and borrowings (but
excluding trade payables, shareholder loans and finance lease obligations), other than the Existing
Loan Note Issuance Deed and Guarantees of Indebtedness under the RCF Facility Agreement.
Although the Indenture will limit the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions.
Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of
liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the
Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

**Principal and maturity**

The Issuer will issue (i) €300 million in aggregate principal amount of Euro Floating Rate Notes, (ii)
€1,500 million in aggregate principal amount of Euro Fixed Rate 2022 Notes, (iii) €900 million in
aggregate principal amount of Euro Fixed Rate 2024 Notes and (iv) SEK 3,000 million in aggregate
principal amount of SEK Floating Rate Notes in this Offering on the Issue Date. The Euro Floating Rate
Notes will mature on July 15, 2022; the Euro Fixed Rate 2022 Notes will mature on July 15, 2022; the
Euro Fixed Rate 2024 Notes will mature on July 15, 2024; and the SEK Floating Rate Notes will mature
on July 15, 2022. The Euro Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The SEK Floating Rate Notes will be issued in minimum
denominations of SEK 1,250,000 and in integral multiples of SEK 10,000 in excess thereof. Each of the
Euro Floating Rate Notes, Euro Fixed Rate 2022 Notes, Euro Fixed Rate 2024 Notes and SEK Floating


-----

Rate Notes will constitute a separate series of Notes, but shall be treated as a single class for all
purposes under the Indenture, including with respect to waivers, amendments or other modifications
of the Indenture or any other action by the holders of the Notes thereunder, except as otherwise
provided in the Indenture.

The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the Notes to receive the payments on such Notes are
subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment or
redemption in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due
to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next
succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment
as a result of any such delay.

**Interest**

**Interest on the Euro Floating Rate Notes**

Interest on the Euro Floating Rate Notes will accrue at a rate per annum (the “Euro Applicable Rate”),
reset quarterly, equal to three-month EURIBOR plus 2.625% per annum, as determined by an agent
approved by the Issuer to calculate EURIBOR for the purposes of the Indenture (the “Euro Calculation
_Agent”), which shall initially be Citibank, N.A., London Branch. Interest on the Euro Floating Rate Notes_
will:

- accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was
most recently paid;

- be payable in cash quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each
year; and

- be payable to the holder of record of such Euro Floating Rate Note on January 1, April 1, July 1
and October 1 immediately preceding the related interest payment date.

The first interest payment date for the Euro Floating Rate Notes will be October 15, 2017.

If a particular interest payment date is not a Business Day, then the payment date will move to the next
Business Day. Therefore, the relevant interest period will be one or more days longer.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Indenture relating to the calculation
of interest on the Euro Floating Rate Notes.

The Euro Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on each
Determination Date, determine the Euro Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of
interest payable in respect of the following Interest Period (the “Euro Interest Amount”). The Euro
Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the Euro Applicable Rate to the principal amount of
each Euro Floating Rate Note outstanding at the end of the Interest Period, multiplying each such
amount by the actual amounts of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360 and rounding
the resultant figure upwards to the nearest available currency unit. The determination of the Euro
Applicable Rate and the Euro Interest Amount by the Euro Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of
willful default, fraud or manifest error, be final and binding on all parties. In no event will the rate of
interest on the Euro Floating Rate Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law;
_provided that the Euro Calculation Agent shall not be responsible for determining if the rate of interest_
on the Euro Floating Rate Notes is higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. The
Trustee and each Paying Agent shall not be responsible for, nor incur any liability in relation to any loss
resulting from any calculation or determination made, or intended to be made, by the Euro Calculation
Agent.

three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination
Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the
arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the SEK
Calculation Agent will request each of three major banks in Stockholm, as selected by the SEK
Calculation Agent in consultation with the Issuer, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a
percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Stockholm time, on such Determination Date,
for loans in an SEK Representative Amount in SEK to leading European banks for a three-month period
beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If fewer than
two such quotations are provided as requested, the SEK Calculation Agent will determine the
arithmetic mean (rounded, if necessary, as aforesaid) of the rates quoted by major banks in Stockholm,
selected by the SEK Calculation Agent in consultation with the Issuer, at approximately 11.00 a.m.
(Stockholm time) on the first day of the relevant Interest Period for loans in SEK to leading European
banks for three months and in an amount that is representative for a single transaction in that market
at that time. In no event shall STIBOR be less than 0%.

Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open.

contained in the Indenture, including the covenant restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness (as
described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”). The Notes issued in this
Offering and, if issued, any Additional Notes will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the
Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers
to purchase, except as otherwise provided for in the Indenture. Unless the context otherwise requires,
in this “Description of the Notes,” references to “Notes” include the Notes offered hereby and any

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts (defined below), if any, on the Global Notes
(as defined below) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents;
_provided that all such payments with respect to Notes represented by one or more Global Notes_
registered in the name of or held by a nominee of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, will be made
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the Holder or Holders
thereof.

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities
(“Definitive Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying
Agents in London, in each case, maintained for such purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive
Registered Notes may be paid by check mailed to the person entitled thereto as shown on the register
for the Definitive Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent and Registrars for the Notes.”

**Paying Agent and Registrars for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each a “Paying Agent”) for the Notes, including a
Paying Agent in London (the “Principal Paying Agent”). The initial Principal Paying Agent for the Notes
will be Citibank, N.A., London Branch.

The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar”). The Issuer will also maintain
a transfer agent in London. The initial Registrar in respect of the Notes will be Citibank, N.A., London
Branch (the “Registrar”) and the initial transfer agent will be Citibank, N.A., London Branch. The
Registrar, Paying Agent and transfer agent, as applicable, will maintain a register reflecting ownership
of Definitive Registered Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and will make payments on and
facilitate transfers of Definitive Registered Notes on behalf of the Issuer. Each transfer agent shall
perform the functions of a transfer agent.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer agent for the Notes without prior notice
to Holders. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the
Notes. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted
for trading on the Global Exchange Market and the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, the
Issuer will publish a notice of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer agent in a newspaper
having a general circulation in Dublin (which is expected to be The Irish Times) or, to the extent and in
the manner permitted by such rules, post such notice on the official website of the Irish Stock
Exchange (www.ise.ie).


-----

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will initially be issued as follows:

- The Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers (“QIBs”) pursuant to Rule
144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by global notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”).

- The Notes sold outside the United States to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the
Securities Act will initially be represented by global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the
“Global Notes”).

- The Global Notes will, upon issuance, be deposited with and registered in the name of the
nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.
Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the
restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully
under “Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in
Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable,
pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and their respective participants.

No Book-Entry Interest in any Global Note representing one series of Notes and no Definitive
Registered Note issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest in such series of Notes may be
transferred or exchanged for any Book-Entry Interest in any Global Note representing another series
of Notes or any Definitive Registered Note issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest in another
series of Notes.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes only upon delivery by the transferor of a
written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made
in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Prior to 40 days after the date of initial issuance of the Notes, ownership of Book Entry Interests in
Regulation S Global Notes will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream
or persons who hold interests through Euroclear or Clearstream, and any sale or transfer of such
interest to U.S. persons shall not be permitted during such period unless such resale or transfer is
made pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. During the 40 day distribution compliance
period, Book Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (“Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”) may
be transferred only to non U.S. persons in compliance with Regulation S of the Securities Act or to
persons whom the transferor reasonably believes are “qualified institutional buyers” within the
meaning of Rule 144A under the Securities Act in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A
under the Securities Act or otherwise in accordance with applicable transfer restrictions and any
applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction. Subject to the
foregoing, Regulation S Book Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of Book Entry Interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes only upon delivery by the transferor of a
written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made
to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the
meaning of Rule 144A under the Securities Act in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A
under the Securities Act or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under
“Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.

Any Book Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will,
upon transfer, cease to be a Book Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and
will become a Book Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and


-----

after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures
applicable to Book Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of
(i) €100,000 aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof (in the case
of the Euro Notes) and (ii) SEK 1,250,000 aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of SEK
10,000 in excess thereof (in the case of the SEK Floating Rate Notes), in each case, upon receipt by
the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation
required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received
by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry
Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set
forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer to be in compliance with applicable law,
be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below
and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes
may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of (i) €100,000 in
aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of the Euro
Notes) and (ii) SEK 1,250,000 aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of SEK 10,000 in
excess thereof (in the case of the SEK Floating Rate Notes). In connection with any such transfer or
exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging holder to, among other things,
furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the
account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, to furnish certain certificates and
opinions, and to pay any taxes, duties and governmental charges in connection with such transfer or
exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any
taxes, duties and governmental charges payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any
Definitive Registered Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of such Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of such Notes to be
redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date
applicable to such Notes; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change
of Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Paying Agents and the transfer agent will be entitled to treat
the Holder of a Note as the owner of it for all purposes.

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

Concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into
the Escrow Agreement with the Trustee and the Escrow Agent, pursuant to which the initial purchasers
will deposit with the Escrow Agent an amount equal to the gross proceeds of the offering of the Notes
into the respective Escrow Accounts. The initial funds deposited in the Escrow Accounts, and all other
funds, securities, interest, dividends, distributions and other property and payments credited to the
Escrow Accounts (less any property and/or funds paid in accordance with the Escrow Agreement) are
referred to, collectively, as the “Escrowed Property.” The Escrowed Property will be controlled by the
Escrow Agent in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the Holders of the Notes. The Notes will not benefit
from any security interest in the Escrow Accounts or in the Escrowed Property.


-----

In order to cause the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Property to the Issuer (the “Release”), the
Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall have received from the Issuer, on or before the Escrow Longstop
Date, an Officer’s Certificate to the effect that:

- (i) the Acquisition will be consummated promptly following the Release and (ii) no material term
or condition of the Acquisition Agreement as in effect on the date of this Offering Memorandum
has been amended or waived in a manner or to the extent that would be materially prejudicial to
the interests of the Holders of the Notes, other than any amendment or waiver made with the
consent of Holders of a majority of the outstanding Notes;

- immediately after consummation of the Acquisition, the Issuer will own, directly or indirectly, the
entire share capital of the Target;

- as of the Completion Date, there is no Event of Default under clause (7) of the first paragraph of
the heading titled “—Events of Default” below with respect to the Issuer.

The Release will occur promptly upon the receipt of the Officer’s Certificate set forth above (the date
of such receipt, the “Completion Date”). Upon the Release, the Escrowed Property will be paid out in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement and the Escrow Accounts will be reduced to zero.

In the event that (a) the Completion Date does not take place on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date,
(b) in the reasonable judgment of the Issuer, the Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior to
the Escrow Longstop Date or (c) there is an event of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection with
respect to the Issuer on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date (the date of any such event being the
“Special Termination Date”), the Issuer will redeem all of the Notes (the “Special Mandatory
_Redemption”) at a price (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”) equal to 100% of the aggregate_
issue price of the respective Notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest from the Issue Date to, but not
including, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below) and Additional Amounts, if any
(subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date).

Notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Issuer, no later than one Business
Day following the Special Termination Date, to the Trustee and the Escrow Agent, and will provide that
the Notes shall be redeemed on a date that is no later than the fifth Business Day after such notice is
given by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement (the “Special Mandatory
_Redemption Date”). On or prior to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall_
pay to the Principal Paying Agents for payment to each Holder the Special Mandatory Redemption
Price for such Holder’s Notes and, concurrently with the payment to such Holders, deliver any excess
Escrowed Property (if any) to the Issuer.

If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange
and the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Irish Stock Exchange that
the Special Mandatory Redemption has occurred and any relevant details relating to such Special
Mandatory Redemption.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

As of the Issue Date all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries and as of the
Completion Date, after giving effect to the Transactions, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be
Restricted Subsidiaries. In the circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—
_Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the Issuer will be permitted to designate other Restricted Subsidiaries as_
Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive
covenants in the Indenture.

**Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

In connection with the Incurrence of certain Indebtedness by the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries, the Trustee shall, at the request of the Issuer, enter into with the Issuer, the relevant


-----

Restricted Subsidiaries and the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives)
one or more intercreditor agreements or deeds (including a restatement, replacement, amendment or
other modification of the Intercreditor Agreement) (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”), on
substantially similar terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms that are not materially less
favorable to the Holders); provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any
personal obligations on the Trustee or adversely affect the personal rights, duties, liabilities,
indemnification or immunities of the Trustee under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement. In
connection with the foregoing, the Issuer shall furnish to the Trustee such documentation in relation
thereto as it may reasonably require.

In relation to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee shall
consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance,
acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided,
_however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant described herein under “—Certain_
_Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”_

The Indenture will also provide that, at the written direction of the Issuer and without the consent of
Holders, the Trustee shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or
inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement that may be Incurred by the
Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries that is subject to the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement (provided that such Indebtedness is Incurred in compliance with the
Indenture), (3) add Guarantors or other Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) secure the Notes (including Additional Notes) or (5) make
any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders of Notes in any
material respect. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee to enter into any amendment to the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders
of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise
permitted below under “—Amendments and Waivers” or as permitted by the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee to
enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations
on the Trustee or, in the opinion of the Trustee, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities
or immunities under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed
to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or
entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have authorized the
Trustee to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or any
restatement, replacement, amendment or other modification to reflect the above on each Holder’s
behalf and the Trustee will not be required to seek the consent of the Holders to perform its obligations
under and in accordance with the above provisions.

A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement and/or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made
available to the Holders upon request to the Issuer.

**Optional Redemption**

_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption”, the Notes are not redeemable at the option of the Issuer._

the Notes, the incurrence of Indebtedness the proceeds of which will be used to redeem the Notes).


-----

In addition, if such redemption or notice is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent,
such notice may state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such
time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived (provided, however, that, in any case,
such redemption date shall be no more than 60 days from the date on which such notice is first given),
or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such
conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived by the redemption date, or by the redemption date
so delayed.

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of the Notes, it will, for so long as the Notes are listed on
the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Global Exchange Market
and the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, inform the Irish Stock Exchange of such optional
redemption and confirm the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that will remain outstanding
immediately after such redemption.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related
interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the
Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be
payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

In connection with any tender offer or other offer to purchase for all of the Notes, if Holders of not less
than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding Notes validly tender and do not
validly withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such tender
offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by such
Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’
notice following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such
purchase at a price equal to the price paid to each other Holder in such tender offer (other than any
incentive payment for early tenders), plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment,
accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but not including, the repurchase date (subject to the
right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date). In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount
of the then-outstanding Notes have validly tendered and not withdrawn Notes in a tender offer or other
offer to purchase for all of the Notes, as applicable, Notes owned by an affiliate of the Issuer or by funds
controlled or managed by any affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be
outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer or other offer, as applicable.

If the Issuer elects to redeem the Notes or portions thereof and, in connection with a satisfaction and
discharge of, or defeasance of, the Indenture, requests that the Trustee distribute to the Holders
amounts deposited in trust with the Trustee (which, for the avoidance of doubt, will include accrued
and unpaid interest to the date fixed for redemption) prior to the date fixed for redemption in
accordance with the provisions set forth under “—Defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge,” the
applicable redemption notice will state (i) that Holders will receive such amounts deposited in trust with
the Trustee prior to the date fixed for redemption and (ii) such earlier payment date.

**Sinking Fund**

Other than in the case of a Special Mandatory Redemption, the Issuer will not be required to make
mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Euro Floating Rate Notes, Euro Fixed Rate 2022 Notes, Euro Fixed Rate 2024
Notes and/or SEK Floating Rate Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee or the Registrar, as
applicable, will select the Euro Floating Rate Notes, Euro Fixed Rate 2022 Notes, Euro Fixed Rate 2024
Notes and/or SEK Floating Rate Notes, as applicable, for redemption in compliance with the rules and
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, or (i) if such Notes are not held through Euroclear or
Clearstream, on a pro rata basis or (ii) if Euroclear or Clearstream prescribe no method of selection, by
use of a pool factor; provided, however, that no Euro Note of €100,000 in aggregate principal amount


-----

or less or SEK Floating Rate Note of SEK 1,250,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be
redeemed in part and only Euro Notes and SEK Floating Rate Notes in integral multiples of €1,000 and
SEK 10,000 will be redeemed, respectively. Neither the Trustee nor the Registrar will be liable for any
selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

So long as any Notes are listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted for trading
on the Global Exchange Market and the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, any such notice
to the Holders of the relevant Notes shall to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules be
posted on the official website of the Irish Stock Exchange (www.ise.ie) and in addition to such release,
not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, the Issuer will mail, or at the
expense of the Issuer, cause to be mailed, such notice to Holders by first class mail, postage prepaid,
at their respective addresses as they appear on the registration books of the Registrar. For Euro Notes
and SEK Floating Rate Notes represented by global certificates held on behalf of Euroclear and
Clearstream, notices may be given by delivery to Euroclear and Clearstream for communications to
entitled account holders in substitution for aforesaid mailing. Such notice of redemption may also be
posted on the website of the Irish Stock Exchange (www.ise.ie), to the extent and in the manner
permitted by the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state
the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case the unredeemed portion of
the original Note will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note.
In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease the
principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms
of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein), Notes called for
redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest
ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer or Successor Issuer, as defined below, may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at
any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice to the Holders of the Notes (which
notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together
with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”)
(subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (see “—Withholding Taxes”), if any, then
due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise
if the Issuer, Successor Issuer or Guarantor determine in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaty (or any regulations,
protocols or rulings promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below
under “—Withholding Taxes”); or

(2) any change in, or amendment to, or the introduction of, an official position regarding the
application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including
a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction) of a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

the Issuer, Successor Issuer or Guarantor are, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the
Notes would be, required to pay any Additional Amounts, and such obligation cannot be avoided by
taking reasonable measures available to the Issuer, Successor Issuer or Guarantor (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable and not
result in any material legal or regulatory burden or any significant additional costs but not including
assignment of the obligation to make payment with respect to the Notes). In the case of redemption
due to withholding as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that is a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction at the date of this Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must become effective
on or after the date of this Offering Memorandum. In the case of redemption due to withholding as a
result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction after the


-----

date of this Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the date
the jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, unless the Change in Tax Law would have
applied to the predecessor of the Successor Issuer. Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be
published in accordance with the procedures described under “—Selection and Notice.”
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior
to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obliged to make such payment of Additional Amounts
if a payment in respect of the Notes were then due and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such
obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any
notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer or Successor Issuer will deliver
to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting
forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right to so redeem have been
satisfied and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing to the effect that the
Issuer, Successor Issuer or Guarantor has or have been or will become obligated to pay Additional
Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept such Officer’s Certificate and
opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without
further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

The foregoing will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to the Issuer is
incorporated or organized or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by the Issuer, a Successor Issuer or a Guarantor (a “Payor”) on the Notes or any
Note Guarantees, as defined below, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or
deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then
required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by
or on behalf of:

(1) Sweden or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having power to
tax;

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Guarantee is made by the
Issuer, Successor Issuer, Guarantor or their agents on their behalf, or any political subdivision or
Governmental Authority thereof or therein having the power to tax; or

(3) any other jurisdiction in which the Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in a trade or
business for tax purposes or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any
political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of
clause (1), (2) and (3), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required from any payments made by a Payor with respect to any Note or
Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price, premium, if any, or interest, the Payor
will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be
necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by the Holders or the
Trustee, as the case may be, after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or
withholding from such Additional Amounts), will equal the amounts which would have been received
in respect of such payments on any such Note or Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or
deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner of a Note (or between a fiduciary,
settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder or
beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust,
partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
(including being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a
permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but


-----

excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding
of such Note or the receipt of any payment in respect thereof;

(2) any Taxes to the extent that they are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder
or the beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a written request of the Payor addressed to the
Holder, after reasonable notice, to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence
concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make
any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters,
which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of withholding or
deduction of, all or part of such Taxes;

(3) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment on or with
respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee;

(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, value added, use, excise, transfer, personal property or similar
tax, assessment or other governmental charge;

(5) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Note presented for payment (where presentation is
permitted or required for payment) by or on behalf of a Holder or beneficial owner who would
have been able to avoid such Tax by presenting the relevant Note to, or otherwise accepting
payment from, another paying agent;

(6) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to a payment to any Holder who is a fiduciary or a
partnership or any Person other than the sole beneficial owner of payment or such Notes to the
extent that the beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such
partnership or the beneficial owner of such Notes would not have been entitled to Additional
Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly;

(7) any Taxes withheld or deducted pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any
amended or successor version of such Sections), any U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated
thereunder, any official interpretations thereof or any agreements (including an intergovernmental
agreement or any law implementing any such agreement) entered into in connection with the
implementation thereof; or

(8) any combination of the above.

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable (x) if the payment could have been made without
such deduction or withholding if the beneficiary of the payment had presented the Note for payment
(where presentation is permitted or required for payment) within 30 days after the relevant payment
was first made available for payment to the Holder or (y) where, had the beneficial owner of the Note
been the Holder, such beneficial owner would not have been entitled to payment of Additional Amounts
by reason of any of clauses (1) to (8) inclusive above.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted
or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all
reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so
deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, in such form as
provided in the ordinary course by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and as is reasonably available to
the Issuer and will provide such certified copies to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made available to
the Holders upon request. The Payor shall attach to each certified copy or other evidence, as
applicable, a certificate stating (x) that the amount of Tax evidenced by the certified copy was paid in
connection with payments under or with respect to the Notes then outstanding upon which such Taxes
were due and (y) the amount of such withholding tax paid per €1,000 of principal amount of the Notes.

If any Payor becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect
to any payment made on any Note or Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment,
the Payor will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will


-----

be payable and the amount so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying
Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to
pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the
Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days
prior to the payment date). The Trustee will be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as
conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in either the Indenture, any Guarantees or this “Description of the Notes” there are
mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this
heading to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in
respect thereof.

The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes, or any other property or
similar taxes, charges or levies that arise in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution,
delivery, registration or enforcement of any Notes, the Indenture, the Security Documents or any other
document or instrument in relation thereto (other than a transfer of the Notes), and the Payor agrees
to indemnify the Holders for any such taxes paid by such Holders. The Payor will also pay any such
taxes, charges, or levies arising in any taxing jurisdiction in connection with the enforcement of the
Notes, or any other such document or instrument, following the occurrence of any Event of Default with
respect to the Notes.

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and
will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to the Issuer is organized or any
political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms hereof, each Holder will have the right to require
the Issuer to repurchase all or part (in integral multiples of (i) €1,000 (in the case of the Euro Notes);
_provided that Euro Notes of_ €100,000 or less may only be redeemed in whole and not in part and
(ii) SEK 10,000 (in the case of the SEK Floating Rate Notes); provided that SEK Floating Rate Notes of
SEK 1,250,000 or less may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) of such Holder’s Notes at a
purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid
interest to the date of purchase and Additional Amounts, if any (subject to the right of Holders of record
on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided,
_however, that the Issuer shall not be obliged to repurchase Notes as described under this “—Change_
_of Control” section in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem_
all of the Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have
been satisfied or waived.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under
“—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later
than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice (the “Change of
_Control Offer”) to each Holder of any such Notes, with a copy to the Trustee:_

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to
require the Issuer to purchase such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of
the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the


-----

date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on
the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from
the date such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Change of Control;

(4) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder
must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(5) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of
Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will,
to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Principal Paying Agents an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in
respect of all Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate
principal amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of
Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Principal Paying Agents the
Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have
been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant
Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder
of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the
Trustee or the Registrar as applicable will promptly authenticate (or cause to be authenticated) and
mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new
Note equal in aggregate principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any;
_provided that each such new (i) Euro Note will be in an aggregate principal amount that is at least_
€100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof and (ii) SEK Floating Rate Note will be in
an aggregate principal amount that is at least SEK 1,250,000 and integral multiples of SEK 10,000 in
excess thereof.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted
for trading on the Global Exchange Market and the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, the
Issuer will publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Change of Control Payment Date in a leading newspaper of general circulation in Dublin
(which is expected to be The Irish Times) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules,
post such notices on the official website of the Irish Stock Exchange (www.ise.ie).

The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other
provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of
Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer
repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The
existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the
occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its
Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.


-----

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third
party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with
the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer
and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in
advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a
definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control, or an offer or other transaction that if
consummated would result in a Change of Control has been publicly announced and, if applicable, not
withdrawn, at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act and any other applicable securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which the
Notes are then listed) in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the
extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with
provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations
(or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of
Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict.

Under the RCF Facility Agreement, the occurrence of a change of control would require the repayment
of such indebtedness. Future debt of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may prohibit the Issuer from
purchasing Notes in the event of a Change of Control or provide that a Change of Control is a default
or require repurchase upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right
to require the Issuer to purchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of,
other debt, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of the purchase on
the Issuer.

The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be
limited to the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes—We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase_
_the Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the_
_Indenture.”_

Holders of the Notes may not be entitled to require the Issuer to purchase their Notes in certain
circumstances involving a significant change in the composition of the Issuer’s board of directors,
including in connection with a proxy contest.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and
assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons.
Although there is limited case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all”, there is no precise
established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would
involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may
be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the
Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders
of a majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes under the Indenture.

**Certain Covenants**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the provisions of the Indenture described
under the captions “—Certain Covenants” and “—Certain Definitions,” to the extent they describe an
allowance on the basis of a percentage of ERC or Total Assets (each, a “Grower Allowance”) (but in
each case only to such extent of such Grower Allowance), shall not apply until the completion of the
Required Disposal.


-----

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness); _provided,_ _however, that the Issuer and any of its Restricted_
Subsidiaries may Incur Indebtedness if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma effect
thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof) as if the additional Indebtedness had
been Incurred at the beginning of the relevant four quarter period, the Consolidated Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio for the Issuer’s most recently ended four fiscal quarters for which internal consolidated
financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional
Indebtedness is Incurred is at least 2.0 to 1.0; provided further that the aggregate principal amount of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this paragraph and clause (11) of the next paragraph by Restricted
Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors shall not exceed €250 million at any one time outstanding.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness:

(1) Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility (including letters of credit or bankers’
acceptances issued or created under any Credit Facility), and any Refinancing Indebtedness in
respect thereof and Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness in a maximum aggregate
principal amount at any time outstanding not exceeding (a) the greater of (i) €1,100 million and
(ii) 35% of ERC, plus (b) in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this
clause (1) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts,
premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(2) (a) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary so long as (i) the Incurrence of such Indebtedness being guaranteed
is permitted under the terms of the Indenture, (ii) if the Indebtedness being guaranteed is
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or to a Note Guarantee then such Guarantee
must be subordinated to the same extent as the Indebtedness being guaranteed and (iii) if
the Indebtedness being guaranteed is Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor, such
Restricted Subsidiary complies with the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries; Future Guarantors”; or_

(b) without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens,” Indebtedness arising
by reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing Indebtedness of the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is
permitted under the terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; _provided,_
_however, that:_

(a) if the Issuer or any Guarantor is the obligor under such Indebtedness and the obligee is not
the Issuer or a Guarantor, such Indebtedness is unsecured and ((i) except in respect of the
intercompany current liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business in connection
with the cash management operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries and
(ii) only to the extent legally permitted (the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries having
completed all procedures required in the reasonable judgment of directors of officers of the
obligee or obligor to protect such Persons from any penalty or civil or criminal liability in
connection with the subordination of such Indebtedness)) expressly subordinated in right of
payment to prior payment in full in cash (whether upon Stated Maturity, acceleration or
otherwise) and the performance in full of its obligations under the Notes and the Indenture;
and

(b) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in
any such Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer and (ii) any sale or other transfer of any such
Indebtedness to a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer, shall


-----

be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4) Indebtedness represented by (a)(i) the Notes (other than any Additional Notes) and any Note
Guarantees thereof, (ii) the MTNs, the Private Placement Notes and the Commercial Paper
Program, in each case, outstanding on the Issue Date and (iii) any “parallel debt” obligation under
the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (b) any Indebtedness
(other than Indebtedness described in clauses (1) and (3) of this paragraph) outstanding on the
Issue Date after giving _pro forma effect to the Transactions and (c) Refinancing Indebtedness_
Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in sub-clause (a), (b) or (c) of this clause (4)

(15) Indebtedness consisting of local lines of credit or working capital facilities not exceeding
€80 million outstanding at any one time.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness
described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will
classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to
include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second paragraph
or the first paragraph of this covenant;

(2) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Completion Date under the RCF Facility Agreement shall be
deemed Incurred on the Completion Date under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the
description of this covenant and not the first paragraph or clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph
of the description of this covenant;

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments or any “parallel debt” obligation relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is
otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be
included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1),
(7), (11), (12) or (15) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters
of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then
such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory
redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase
premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one
provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and
in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; and

(7) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be
equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization
of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment
of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the
reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS
will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under
this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall
be calculated as specified under the definition of “Indebtedness.”

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date.

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro- or SEK-denominated (as applicable) restriction
on the Incurrence of Indebtedness (including any Indebtedness to be Incurred under the first
paragraph of this covenant or by reference to a percentage of ERC or Total Assets) or for purposes of
calculating the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or Consolidated Leverage Ratio for any


-----

other purpose under the Indenture, in each applicable case, the euro or SEK equivalent of the
aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated
based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred,
in the case of term Indebtedness or, at the option of the Issuer, first committed or first Incurred
(whichever yields the lower euro or SEK equivalent, as applicable), in the case of Indebtedness
Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance
other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro or SEK, as applicable, and such
refinancing would cause the applicable ratio or euro- or SEK-denominated restriction, as applicable, to
be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such
refinancing, such ratio or euro- or SEK-denominated restriction, as applicable, shall be deemed not to
have been exceeded so long as the aggregate principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness
does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus the
aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, premiums (including
tender premiums) and other costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or
similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing; (b) subject to clause (c) below, the euro or
SEK equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue
Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and
(c) if and for so long as any such Indebtedness is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the
currency in which such Indebtedness is denominated covering all or any portion the principal and
interest on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro or SEK, as
applicable, will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be
exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of
any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the
Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable
to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date
of such refinancing.

Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor (if any) will incur any Indebtedness (including any Indebtedness
permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the second paragraph of this covenant) that is contractually
subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any such Guarantor unless
such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and the
applicable Guarantee thereof on substantially identical terms (as determined in good faith by the
Issuer); provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in
right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being
unsecured, by virtue of being secured with different collateral, by virtue of being secured on a junior
priority basis, by virtue of being guaranteed by different obligors or by virtue of the application of
waterfall or other payment-ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness under
Credit Facilities.

subsequent to the Issue Date (and not returned or rescinded) (including Permitted Payments
permitted below by clauses (5), (6), (10), (11), (12) and (17) of the second succeeding paragraph,
but excluding all other Restricted Payments permitted by the second succeeding paragraph)
would exceed the sum of (without duplication):

that has been converted into or exchanged for Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than

received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary),

which amount, in each case under this clause (iv), was included in the calculation of the
amount of Restricted Payments referred to in the first sentence of this clause (c); provided,

succeeding paragraph) of property or assets or of marketable securities received by the
Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with:

Restricted Subsidiary) of Capital Stock of an Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Issuer; and

(B) any dividend or distribution made by an Unrestricted Subsidiary or Affiliate to the Issuer

of the preceding clause (i) to the extent that it is (at the Issuer’s option) included under this
clause (v).


-----

The fair market value of property or assets other than cash covered by the preceding sentence shall
be the fair market value thereof as determined in good faith by an Officer or the Board of Directors of
the Issuer.

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit any of the following (collectively, “Permitted Payments”):

(16) payment of any Receivables Fees and purchases of Receivables Assets pursuant to a
Receivables Repurchase Obligation in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing; and

(17) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (or would result
therefrom), any Restricted Payment; provided that the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of the Issuer
on a pro forma basis after giving effect to any such Restricted Payment does not exceed 3.00 to
1.00.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment
meets the criteria of more than one of the categories described in clauses (1) through (17) above, or
is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer will be entitled to classify such
Restricted Payment (or portion thereof) on the date of its payment or later reclassify such Restricted
Payment (or portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of
such Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The
fair market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of
any non-cash Restricted Payment shall be determined conclusively by an Officer or the Board of
Directors of the Issuer acting in good faith. For purposes hereof, unsecured Indebtedness shall not be
deemed to be subordinate or junior to Indebtedness that is secured by virtue of it not being secured.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur
or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest
therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the


-----

“Initial Lien”), except (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens
if the Notes (or any Note Guarantee in the case of Liens of any Guarantor) are secured equally and
ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the
Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien (in each case, including pursuant to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) for so long as such Indebtedness
is so secured.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes pursuant to clause (2) of the preceding paragraph will be
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and discharge of the
Initial Lien to which it relates.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit
to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of
any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock held by
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or pay any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions_
prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination
of (including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the RCF Finance
Documents) or (b) any other agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into
on the Issue Date after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions (including for purposes of this
clause (1) any such agreement or instrument of any member of the Target Group), including,
without limitation, the Indenture, the Notes and the Intercreditor Agreement;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to
any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such
Person was acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such
agreement or instrument is assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with
an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in,
or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of
related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was
acquired by the Issuer or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in connection with such transaction) and outstanding
on such date;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument
referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or
contained in any amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in
clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3); provided, however, that the encumbrances
and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or
instrument are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which


-----

such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in good
faith by the Issuer);

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property
or asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer
of any lease, license or other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements not prohibited by
the Indenture or securing Indebtedness or other obligations of the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary not prohibited by the Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions
restrict the transfer of the property or assets subject to such mortgages, pledges, charges
or other security agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth
in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) (x) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized
Lease Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or
restrictions on the property so acquired or (y) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to a joint
venture, co-investment or similar agreements (and any agreements ancillary or consequential
thereto) that impose restrictions on the transfer of the rights, property or assets of the joint
venture, co-investment vehicle or other entity the subject of any such agreement(s);

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property or
assets) imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or
disposition to a Person of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted
Subsidiary (or the property or assets that are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of
such sale or disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements, co-investment and other
similar or related agreements and instruments, in each case, entered into in the ordinary course
of business or where the Issuer determines that such encumbrances or restrictions will not
adversely affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest payments
on the Notes;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable
rule, regulation or order, or required by any regulatory authority;

(9) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers or
suppliers, or as required by insurance, surety or bonding companies or indemnities, in each case,
under agreements or policies entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements or
Commodity Hedging Agreements;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions
of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially
less favorable to the Holders than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the RCF
Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
together with the security documents associated therewith as in effect on the Issue Date after
giving pro forma effect to the Transactions or (ii) in comparable financings (as determined in good
faith by the Issuer) and where the Issuer determines when such Indebtedness is Incurred that
such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s
ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes;


-----

(12) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any Lien permitted under “—Limitation on
_Liens”; or_

(13) restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing that, in the good faith
determination of an Officer or the Board of Directors of the Issuer, are necessary or advisable to
effect such Qualified Receivables Financing.

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition
unless:

(1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including
by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent
or otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on
the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by an
Officer or the Board of Directors of the Issuer, of the shares and assets subject to such Asset
Disposition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset
Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the
Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset
Disposition (excluding any consideration by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming
responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, other than Indebtedness) received by the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash, Cash Equivalents
or Temporary Cash Investments; and

(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied by the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be:

(a) to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is
required by the terms of any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary), within 365 days from
the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available
Cash, (i) to prepay, repay or purchase any Indebtedness of a non-Guarantor Restricted
Subsidiary (in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary) or Indebtedness under the RCF Facility Agreement or any other Indebtedness
Incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph of the “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” covenant;_ _provided, however, that, in connection with any prepayment,_
repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (a) (other than any
prepayment or repayment of Indebtedness under the RCF Facility Agreement with the net
cash proceeds from a Required Disposal), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire
such Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment (if any) to be permanently
reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased; (ii) to
prepay, repay or purchase Pari Passu Indebtedness at a price of no more than 100% of the
principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid interest to the
date of such prepayment, repayment or purchase; _provided that the Issuer shall redeem,_
repay or repurchase Pari Passu Indebtedness that is Public Debt pursuant to this clause
(ii) only if the Issuer makes (at such time or subsequently in compliance with this covenant)
an offer to all Holders of the Notes to purchase their Notes at a purchase price equal to or
greater than 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but
not including) the date of purchase and/or redeems Notes pursuant to the redemption
provisions set forth above under the caption “—Optional Redemption”, in each case on a
_pro rata basis with any such other Pari Passu Indebtedness that is purchased; or (iii) to_
prepay, repay or purchase any Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien on the assets or
property which were the subject of the Asset Disposition (other than Subordinated
Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary);


-----

(b) to the extent the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, within 365 days from the later
of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash,
to redeem Notes pursuant to the redemption provisions set forth above under the caption
“—Optional Redemption” and/or (at the option of the Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary)
purchase Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders at a purchase price equal to at least 100%
of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest;

(c) to the extent the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit to invest
in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a
Restricted Subsidiary with Net Available Cash received by the Issuer or another Restricted
Subsidiary) within 365 days from the later of (i) the date of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the
receipt of such Net Available Cash; _provided, however, that any such reinvestment in_
Additional Assets made pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or a commitment
approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer that is executed or approved within such
time will satisfy this requirement, so long as such investment is consummated within
180 days of such 365th day; or

(d) any combination of the foregoing,

_provided that, pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with clause_
(a), (b), (c) or (d) above, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce
Indebtedness or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the
Indenture.

Except as set forth in the second succeeding paragraph, for purposes of determining compliance with
the provisions of this covenant, the euro equivalent of any Indebtedness denominated in another
currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
Indebtedness was Incurred.

Any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to be
applied or invested as provided in the first paragraph of this covenant will be deemed to constitute
“Excess Proceeds” under the Indenture. On the 366th day (or the 546th day, in the case of any Net
Available Cash committed to be used pursuant to any definitive binding agreement or commitment
approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer pursuant to clause (c) of the first paragraph of this
covenant) after the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net
Available Cash, or at such earlier date that the Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess
Proceeds under the Indenture exceeds €90 million, the Issuer will be required to make an offer (“Asset
_Disposition Offer”) to all Holders of Notes issued under the Indenture and, to the extent the Issuer_
elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum
aggregate principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset
Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in
respect of the Notes in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and, in the case
of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such
Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including,
the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements
governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and in minimum denominations of
(i) €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of Euro Notes) and (ii)
SEK 1,250,000 and in integral multiples of SEK 10,000 in excess thereof (in the case of SEK Floating
Rate Notes). For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may make an Asset
Disposition Offer prior to the expiration of the 366-day or 546-day period, as applicable, referred to
above.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and
not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the
Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other
covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in
any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or


-----

lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated
among each series of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the
basis of the aggregate principal amount of each series of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so
tendered. For the purposes of calculating the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness
not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such aggregate
principal amounts into their euro equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within
the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer,
the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in
a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated, the amount thereof
payable in respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which
such Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion into
such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less
than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later
than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset
_Disposition Purchase Date”), the Issuer will purchase the aggregate principal amount of Notes and, to_
the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased pursuant to this covenant (the
“Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly
tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition
Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for
payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and
Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition
Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations of
(i) €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of Euro Notes) and (ii)
SEK 1,250,000 and in integral multiples of SEK 10,000 in excess thereof (in the case of SEK Floating
Rate Notes). The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Notes or
portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this
covenant. The Issuer or the relevant Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case
not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver
to each tendering Holder of Notes an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase, and
the Issuer will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the Global Note), and the Trustee or the Registrar,
as applicable, upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate and mail or
deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) such new Note to such Holder, in an aggregate
principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered; provided that each such
new Note will be in an aggregate principal amount with a minimum denomination of €100,000 (in the
case of Euro Notes) and SEK 1,250,000 (in the case of SEK Floating Rate Notes). Any Note not so
accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Issuer to the Holder
thereof.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to
be cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness of the Issuer or Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor) and the release
of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness in connection
with such Asset Disposition;


-----

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer from the transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash
or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of
such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are
released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset
Disposition; provided that such Indebtedness is not, directly or indirectly, secured by any Lien on
any of the assets or property of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (including Capital Stock
of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer);

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer (other than Subordinated Indebtedness)
received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in
such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other
Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time
outstanding, not to exceed the greater of €90 million and 1.5% of Total Assets (with the fair market
value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received
and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value); and

(6) any Capital Stock or assets of a kind referred to in clause (3)(c) of the first paragraph of this
covenant.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of any applicable securities laws
or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which the Notes are then listed) in connection with the
repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws
or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with
the applicable securities laws and regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have
breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of any conflict.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter
into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or
exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the
Issuer (any such transaction or series of related transactions, “Affiliate Transaction”) involving
aggregate value in excess of €30 million unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a
comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement
providing for such transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate;
and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of €60 million, the
terms of such transaction have been approved by a majority of the members of the Board of
Directors of the Issuer.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (2) of
this paragraph if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments,” any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to
clause (9)(ii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments”) or any Permitted Investment (other than Permitted Investments as defined in_
paragraphs (1)(b), (2) and (14) of the definition thereof);


-----

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or
other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of,
or entering into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit
plan, program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other
compensation arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the
Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans,
stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’
plans (including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement,
savings or similar plans, programs or arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of officers,
employees, directors or consultants approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer, in each
case in the ordinary course of business;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) any transaction between or among the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted
Subsidiaries;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities
(including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses
provided on behalf of, directors, officers, consultants or employees of the Issuer, any Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer or any Parent (whether directly or indirectly and including through any
Person owned or controlled by any of such directors, officers or employees);

(6) the Transactions and the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction pursuant to or contemplated by, and
any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of
or on the Issue Date after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions or, with respect to the Target
Group, the Completion Date, as these agreements and instruments may be amended, modified,
supplemented, extended, renewed or refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other
terms of this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any material
respect and the entry into and performance of any registration rights or other listing agreement in
connection with any Public Offering;

(7) execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or the formation and
maintenance of any consolidated group for tax, accounting or cash pooling or management
purposes in the ordinary course of business;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in
each case, in the ordinary course of business which are fair to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted
Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or the Senior Management
of the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable than those
that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Issuer or an Associate, similar entity or Co-Investment Vehicle
that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate, similar entity or CoInvestment Vehicle;

(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference
Shares) of the Issuer or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock or
Subordinated Shareholder Funding; _provided that the interest rate and other financial terms of_
such Subordinated Shareholder Funding are approved by a majority of the members of the Board
of Directors of the Issuer in their reasonable determination and (b) any amendment, waiver or
other transaction with respect to any Subordinated Shareholder Funding in compliance with the
other provisions of the Indenture;


-----

(11) payment to any Permitted Holder of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses Incurred by such
Permitted Holder in connection with its direct or indirect investment in the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries;

(12) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Receivables Financing;

(13) the performance of any transactions or obligations of any Person or any of its Subsidiaries under
the terms of any transaction arising out of, or payments made pursuant to or for the purposes of
funding, any agreement or instrument in effect at the time such Person is acquired by the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary, including by way of a merger, amalgamation or consolidation with
or into the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in a transaction that is not prohibited by the
Indenture; provided that such agreements or instruments were not made in contemplation of such
acquisition, merger, amalgamation or consolidation and were in existence on, or made pursuant
to binding commitments existing on, the date of such acquisition, merger, amalgamation or
consolidation; and

(14) transactions in which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, delivers to the
Trustee a letter or opinion from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that (i) the terms are not
materially less favorable to the Issuer or its relevant Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be,
than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arm’s length basis or (ii) that the transaction
is fair to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view.

**_Reports_**

For so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will provide to the Trustee the following reports:

(1) within 120 days after the end of the Issuer’s fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2017, annual reports containing, to the extent applicable, the following information:

the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year; (c) an operating and financial review of

comparable to the English language version of the Issuer’s annual report for the year ended
December 31, 2016 and material recent developments (to the extent not previously reported
pursuant to clauses (2) and (3) below);

(2) within 60 days following the end of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Issuer
beginning with the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2017, all quarterly reports of the Issuer
containing the following information: (a) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as
of the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the
most recent quarter ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and the comparable
prior year periods, together with condensed footnote disclosure; (b) unaudited pro forma income
statement information and balance sheet information of the Issuer (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall not include the provision of a full income statement or balance sheet to the extent not
reasonably available), together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions,
dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently


-----

completed fiscal year; (c) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements,
including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, EBITDA and material
changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Issuer and a discussion of material changes not
in the ordinary course of business in commitments and contingencies since the most recent
report; and (d) material recent developments (to the extent not previously reported pursuant to
clause (3) below); and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring or any
senior executive officer changes or change in auditors of the Issuer, or any other material event
that the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries announces publicly, a report containing a
description of such event.

All financial statement and pro forma financial information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS
as in effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then
in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods presented; provided, however, that the reports set
forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in applicable IFRS, present earlier
periods on a basis that applied to such periods. The filing of an Annual Report on Form 20-F within the
time period specified in (1) will satisfy such provision.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary,
constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the annual and quarterly financial information
required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant shall include either (i) a
reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes
thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries other than
any Unrestricted Subsidiary (as applicable) separate from the financial condition and results of
operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of Issuer or (ii) stand-alone audited or unaudited financial
statements, as the case may be, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as a
group or otherwise) together with an unaudited reconciliation to the financial information of the Issuer
and its Subsidiaries other than any Unrestricted Subsidiary (as applicable), which reconciliation shall
include the following items: net revenues, EBITDA, ERC, net income, cash, total assets, total debt and
interest expense.

Substantially concurrently with the issuance to the Trustee of the reports specified in clauses (1), (2)
and (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer shall also (a) use its commercially reasonable
efforts (i) to post copies of such reports on such website as may be then maintained by the Issuer and
its Subsidiaries or (ii) otherwise to provide substantially comparable availability of such reports (as
determined by the Issuer in good faith) or (b) to the extent the Issuer determines in good faith that it
cannot make such reports available in the manner described in the preceding clause (a) owing to
applicable law or after the use of its commercially reasonable efforts, furnish such reports to the
Holders and, upon request, prospective purchasers of the Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event the Issuer either (i) posts copies of such reports on such website as may be then maintained by
the Issuer and its Subsidiaries or (ii) otherwise provides substantially comparable availability of such
reports (as determined by the Issuer in good faith), it will be deemed to have provided such reports to
the Trustee.

In addition, so long as the Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the Parent is
not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g32(b), the Parent shall furnish to the Holders and, upon their request, prospective purchasers of the
Notes, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

**Merger and Consolidation**

**_The Issuer_**

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially
all its assets, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to, any Person, unless:


-----

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Issuer”) will be a Person organized
and existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union, the United Kingdom, the
United States of America, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia, Canada or
any province of Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Issuer (if not the Issuer) will
expressly assume (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the
Indenture and (b) all obligations of the Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement or such
Additional Intercreditor Agreement (to the extent required by the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement);

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes
an obligation of the Successor Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Successor Issuer as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Issuer or such Subsidiary at the time of
such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Successor Issuer would be able
to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Consolidated Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio of the Successor Issuer would not be less than the Consolidated Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel,
each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if
any) comply with the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental
indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and
binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Issuer (in each case, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee), provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel,
counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact, including as to satisfaction
of clauses (2) and (3) above.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition
of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which
properties and assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to
be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer.

The Successor Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power
of, the Issuer under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the
predecessor Issuer will not be released from its obligations under such Indenture or the Notes.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) (which do not apply to transactions referred to in
this sentence) and, other than with respect to the second preceding paragraph, clause (4) of the first
paragraph of this covenant, (a) any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer may consolidate or otherwise
combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer and (b) the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may undertake a Permitted Reorganization.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (3) and (4) (which do not apply to the transactions referred to
in this sentence), the Issuer may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or a
portion of its assets to an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal
domicile of the Issuer, reincorporating the Issuer in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of
the Issuer.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.


-----

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this
covenant) will not apply to the creation of a new subsidiary of the Issuer that becomes a parent of one
or more of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries.

**Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status**

If, on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on
that day (the “Suspension Date”) and continuing until the Reversion Date, the provisions of the
Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to such Notes: “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments,” “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions_
_from Restricted Subsidiaries,” “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions,” “—Limitation on Sales of Assets_
_and Subsidiary Stock,” “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries;_
_Future Guarantors” and the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described_
under “—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”, and, in each case, any related default provision of
the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries. Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their
terms from the first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not,
however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Issuer properly taken during the continuance of
the Suspension Event, and the “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as
if it has been in effect since the date of such Indenture except that no Default will be deemed to have
occurred solely by reason of a Restricted Payment made while that covenant was suspended. On the
Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be
classified, at the Issuer’s option, as having been Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or one of the clauses set forth in the second
paragraph of such covenant (to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be Incurred
thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to Indebtedness Incurred prior to the
Suspension Event and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the extent such Indebtedness
would not be so permitted to be incurred under the first two paragraphs of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” such Indebtedness will be deemed to have been outstanding
on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of
the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

The Issuer shall notify the Trustee and the Holders that the two conditions set forth in the first
paragraph under this heading have been satisfied, _provided that such notification shall not be a_
condition for the suspension of the covenants set forth above to be effective. The Trustee shall not be
obliged to notify Holders of such event.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an investment grade rating.

**_Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries; Future Guarantors_**

The Issuer will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, directly
or indirectly, to Guarantee any Public Debt or any refinancing thereof in whole or in part unless such
Restricted Subsidiary becomes a Guarantor on the date on which such other Guarantee or other
Indebtedness, as applicable, is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a
supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted
Subsidiary will provide a Guarantee of the Notes, which Note Guarantee will be senior to or pari passu
with such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such other Indebtedness.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event that on any date the MTNs and any Eligible MTN
Replacement Indebtedness that contains a covenant substantially similar to the MTN Negative Pledge
Provision have been repaid in full, the Issuer will procure that the Restricted Subsidiaries which
Guarantee any Indebtedness under the RCF Facility Agreement will each, within 60 days of such date,
become a Guarantor and, if applicable, execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in
the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Note


-----

Guarantee, which Note Guarantee will be senior to or _pari passu with such Restricted Subsidiary’s_
Guarantee of the RCF Facility Agreement.

A Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor may become a Guarantor if it executes and delivers to
the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such
Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Guarantee of the Notes.

Each Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to
guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference,
financial assistance, corporate purpose, thin capitalization, distributable reserves, capital maintenance
or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer shall not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary
to Guarantee the Notes to the extent and for so long as such Restricted Subsidiary is an Excluded
Subsidiary or the Incurrence of such Guarantee is not required to be granted by operation of the
Agreed Security Principles or could reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in: (1) any violation
of applicable law or regulation; (2) any liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case
of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such
partnership); (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other
than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and other than reasonable expenses incurred in connection
with any governmental or regulatory filings required as a result of, or any measures pursuant to clause
(1) of this paragraph undertaken in connection with, such Guarantee, which in any case under any of
clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this paragraph cannot be avoided through measures reasonably available to
the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; or (4) an inconsistency with the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will automatically and unconditionally terminate and release (and
thereupon will terminate and discharge and be of no further force and effect):

- upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of ownership
interests in the Guarantor (directly or through a parent company) such that the Guarantor does
not remain a Restricted Subsidiary, or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets
of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each case, otherwise
permitted by the Indenture;

- upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary;

- upon the defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and
“—Satisfaction and Discharge;”

- in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

- in the case of any Restricted Subsidiary that after the Issue Date is required to Guarantee the
Notes pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, upon the release or discharge of the
Guarantee of Indebtedness by such Restricted Subsidiary that resulted in the obligation to
Guarantee the Notes; _provided that no Event of Default would arise as a result and such_
Restricted Subsidiary does not Guarantee any other Public Debt of the Issuer or any Guarantor;

- in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization; or

- as described under “—Amendments and Waivers.”


-----

**_Maintenance of Listing_**

The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes
on the Global Exchange Market of the Irish Stock Exchange for so long as such Notes are outstanding;
provided that if the Issuer is unable to obtain admission to such listing or if at any time the Issuer
determines that it will not maintain such listing, it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to (where
the Notes are initially so listed, prior to the delisting of the Notes from Global Exchange Market), and
thereafter use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain, a listing of such Notes on another
“recognised stock exchange” as defined in Section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 of the United
Kingdom.

**_Payments for Consent_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, pay or
cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any Holder of Notes for or as an inducement
to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms of the provisions of the Indenture or the Notes
unless such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all Holders that consent, waive or agree
to amend in the time frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or
agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be
permitted, in any offer or payment of consideration for, or as an inducement to, any consent, waiver or
amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Indenture, to exclude Holders in any jurisdiction or
any category of Holders where (1) the solicitation of such consent, waiver or amendment, including in
connection with any tender or exchange offer, or (2) the payment of the consideration therefor could
reasonably be interpreted as requiring the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to file a
registration statement, prospectus or similar document under any applicable securities laws or listing
requirements (including, but not limited to, the United States federal securities laws, the laws of the
United Kingdom and the laws of the European Union or any of its member states), which the Issuer in
its sole discretion determines (acting in good faith) (a) would be materially burdensome (it being
understood that it would not be materially burdensome to file the consent document(s) used in other
jurisdictions, any substantially similar documents or any summary thereof with the securities or
financial services authorities in such jurisdiction); or (b) such solicitation would otherwise not be
permitted under applicable law in such jurisdiction or with respect to such category of Holders.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note when due and
payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under
the Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required
repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure to comply with the provisions of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Merger and Consolidation”;_

(4) failure to comply for 30 days after written notice by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the
Holders of 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes with any of the Issuer’s
obligations under the covenants described under “—Change of Control” above (other than a
failure to purchase Notes which will constitute an Event of Default under clause (2) above);

(5) failure by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after written notice
by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of 30% in aggregate principal amount
of the outstanding Notes with its other agreements contained in the Indenture;

(6) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by
which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any


-----

of its Restricted Subsidiaries) other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date
hereof, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately
upon the expiration of any grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”);
or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross acceleration
_provision”);_

and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with
the aggregate principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been
a payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates €55 million
or more;

(7) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer or a Significant
Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited
consolidated financial statements of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute
a Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(8) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, to pay final judgments aggregating in
excess of €55 million (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has
acknowledged liability for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60
days after the judgment becomes final (the “judgment default provision”);

(9) any Note Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary or a group of Guarantors that when taken together
(as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year), would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary, ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such
Note Guarantee or the Indenture) or is declared invalid or unenforceable in a judicial proceeding
or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Note Guarantee and any
such Default continues for 10 days (the “guarantee provisions”); and

(10) failure by the Issuer to consummate a Special Mandatory Redemption as described under the
caption “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

However, a default under clauses (4), (5), (6) or (8) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of
Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes notify the Issuer of the default and, with respect to clauses (4), (5), (6) or (8), the Issuer does not
cure such default within the time specified in clauses (4), (5), (6) or (8), as applicable, of this paragraph
after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (7) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee
at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid
interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a
declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts,
if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes
because an Event of Default described in clause (6) under “—Events of Default” has occurred and is
continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of
default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (6) shall have been
remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise
to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of
acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not
conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of


-----

Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on
the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or
waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (7) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium,
if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Notes will
become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the
Trustee or any Holders.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture
may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of
principal, premium or interest, or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with
respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or
decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers
under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered
to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense.
Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue
any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested
in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing the Trustee indemnity and/or security against any loss,
liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written
request and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given
the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request
within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the
Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in
the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of
its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the
Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that
would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee
will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to it against all losses and expenses
caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and a responsible officer of the
Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the
Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment
of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so
long as a committee of trust officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is
in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the
end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any
Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within
30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would


-----

constitute a Default, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect
thereof.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such
Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will
also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply
with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice
or certificate pursuant to any other provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the
delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even
though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Notes provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but
only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the
Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the
Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be
for Holders to take action directly.

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Note Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, such Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any
provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of,
or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes). If any amendment, supplement or waiver will only
affect one series of Notes, only the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes of that affected series (and not the consent of the holders of the majority of all
Notes) shall be required. However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% of the
then-outstanding aggregate principal amount of Notes affected (provided that if any amendment,
supplement or waiver will only affect one series of the Notes, then only the consent of the holders of
at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of that affected series
(and not the consent of the holders of at least 90% of all Notes) shall be required), an amendment or
waiver may not, with respect to any such Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note;

(3) reduce the principal of, or extend the Stated Maturity of, any such Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which
any such Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “—Optional
_Redemption”;_

(5) make any such Note payable in money other than that stated in such Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal,
interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes on or after the
due date therefor;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes” that
adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the
terms of such Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes
described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so


-----

described thereunder unless the Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect
thereof;

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or
interest or Additional Amounts, if any (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes
by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of
the payment default that resulted from such acceleration); or

(9) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent
described in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee and the other
parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Note Document to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency, conform any provision to this
“Description of the Notes,” or reduce the minimum denomination of the Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any
Guarantor under any Note Document;

(3) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided that the
uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code);

(4) add to the covenants or provide for a Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any
right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect;

(6) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) for the issuance
of Additional Notes in accordance with the Indenture;

(7) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries; Future Guarantors,” to add_
Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add Collateral for the benefit of the Notes, or to confirm
and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Guarantee or Lien with
respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking is
provided for under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement; or

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Note Documents of a
successor Trustee and pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the
Trustee to any Note Document.

The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on such evidence as it deems appropriate including Officer’s
Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance
of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any
Holder of Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid
by such tender.

For purposes of determining whether the Holders of the requisite principal amount of all Notes have
taken any action under the Indenture, the principal amount of the SEK Floating Rate Notes shall be
deemed to be the euro equivalent of such principal amount of SEK Floating Rate Notes based on the
exchange rate as of (i) if a record date has been set with respect to the taking of such action, such date
or (ii) if no such record date has been set, the date the taking of such action by the Holders of such
requisite principal amount is certified to the Trustee by the Issuer.


-----

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required aggregate principal amount of the Notes have
concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, any Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly
or indirectly controlling, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer
will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all its and any Guarantor’s obligations under the Notes and the
Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for
certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties,
immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and
obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes, registrations of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or
stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments
held in trust.

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and any Guarantors’ obligations under the covenants
described under “—Certain Covenants” (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”) and “—Change of
_Control” and the default provisions relating to such covenants described under “—Events of Default”_
above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions,
the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Issuer and its Significant Subsidiaries, the
judgment default provision, the guarantee provisions and the security default provisions described
under “—Events of Default” above (“covenant defeasance”).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment
of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. If the
Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may
not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to
clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger
_and Consolidation—The Issuer”), (4), (5), (6), (7) (other than with respect to the Issuer), (8) or (9) under_
“—Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
“defeasance trust”) with the Trustee (or such entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee
for this purpose) (i) with respect to the Euro Notes, cash in euros or euro-denominated European
Government Obligations or a combination thereof for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and
interest on the Euro Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be and (ii) with respect to the
SEK Floating Rate Notes, cash in SEK or SEK-denominated Swedish Government Obligations or a
combination thereof for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the SEK Floating
Rate Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be; provided that, if requested by the Issuer,
the Trustee will distribute any amounts deposited in trust to the Holders prior to the Stated Maturity or
redemption date, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including
delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders of the Notes will not
recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit
and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the
same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance
had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United
States must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in
applicable U.S. federal income tax law since the issuance of the Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;


-----

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for
or relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied
with;

(4) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute,
or is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of
1940; and

(5) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee all other documents or other information that the Trustee may
reasonably require in connection with either defeasance option.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of
conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all
outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than
certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes and certain Notes for which provision for payment was
previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the
Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have
become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or
(iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for
the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the
Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or such entity designated or
appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this purpose), (i) with respect to the Euro Notes, euros or
euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof and (ii) with respect to
the SEK Floating Rate Notes, SEK or SEK-denominated Swedish Government Obligations or a
combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire
indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal,
premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and
payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be, provided that, if requested
by the Issuer, the Trustee will distribute any amounts deposited in trust to the Holders prior to the
Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid
all other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions under
the Indenture to apply the deposited money towards payment of the Notes at maturity or on the
redemption date, as the case may be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each to the effect that all conditions precedent under
the “—Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge
of the Indenture have been complied with, provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s
Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2), (3)
and (4)).

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer under the Note Documents
or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder
by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the
consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the
U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

Citibank, N.A., London Branch will be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will
provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the
Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically
in such Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will exercise such of the


-----

rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent
Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain
from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and
Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced.
Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders
of a majority in principal amount of the then-outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving
written notice to the Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest
that is not eliminated or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt,
then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less
than 6 months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor
Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of
appointment by the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification and security of the Trustee by the Issuer
for any loss, liability and expenses incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on
its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

All notices to Holders of Notes will be validly given if mailed to them at their respective addresses in
the register of the Holders of the Notes, if any, maintained by the relevant Registrar. In addition, for so
long as any of the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of the Irish Stock
Exchange shall so require, notices with respect to the Notes will be published in a newspaper having
general circulation in Dublin (which is expected to be The Irish Times) or, to the extent and in the
manner permitted by such rules, posted on the official website of the Irish Stock Exchange
(www.ise.ie). In addition, for so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to
Holders of the Notes will be delivered to Euroclear and Clearstream, each of which will give such
notices to the holders of Book Entry Interests. Such notice of any amendment, supplement or waiver
may also be published on the website of the Irish Stock Exchange (www.ise.ie), to the extent and in
the manner permitted by the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published
more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; _provided that, if_
notices are mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication
and the seventh day after being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be
mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to
such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a
Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or
communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee
receives it.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the
Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against
the Issuer for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed three years after the applicable
due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

The euro and SEK are the sole currencies of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer
and any Guarantors under or in connection with the Euro Notes and SEK Floating Rate Notes, as


-----

applicable, and any Note Guarantees, as the case may be, including damages. Any amount received
or recovered in a currency other than euro (with respect to the Euro Notes) and SEK (with respect to
the SEK Floating Rate Notes), whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a
court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by
any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a
Guarantor will only constitute a discharge of the obligations of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as
applicable, to the extent of the euro amount or the SEK Floating Rate amount, as applicable, which the
recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on
the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on
the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that euro amount or SEK amount is less than the euro amount or SEK amount, as applicable,
expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any Note, the Issuer and any Guarantor will
indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event,
the Issuer and any Guarantor will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint or several basis
against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision,
it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note or the Trustee to
certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used)
the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and
independent obligation from the Issuer’s and any Guarantor’s other obligations, will give rise to a
separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder
of a Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full
force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of
any sum due under any Note, any Note Guarantee or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any
euro-denominated restriction herein, the euro equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is
denominated in a non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate
in effect on the date such non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all the assets of the Issuer are held outside the United States, and any judgment
obtained in the United States against the Issuer, including judgments with respect to the payment of
principal, premium, if any, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any
purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectable within the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the
Notes and any Note Guarantees, the Issuer will in the Indenture, and any Guarantor will in any
Supplemental Indenture, irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the
Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New York, United States.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes, including any Note Guarantees, and the rights and duties of the parties
thereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
The Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements will be governed by English
law.

in the ordinary course of business), transfer, issuance or other disposition, or a series of related sales,

“—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation” and not by the provisions described under the
caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock:” provided, further,
that the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the economic benefit of a portfolio of loans or
receivables (or any specified portion thereof) pursuant to a derivative instrument or otherwise will,
subject to the next succeeding sentence, constitute an Asset Disposition of the underlying portfolio
assets (or specified percentage thereof) for all purposes of the Indenture (a “Synthetic Sale”).

respect of such sale or acquisition;

(16) any surrender or waiver of contract rights or the settlement, release, recovery on or surrender of

company, any business, or any group of assets constituting an operating unit of a business (any
such disposition, a “Sale”) or if the transaction giving rise to the need to calculate the

the Consolidated Net Income (if negative) attributable thereto for such period and (b) the
Consolidated Interest Expense for such period shall be reduced by an amount equal to the
Consolidated Interest Expense directly attributable to any Indebtedness of the Issuer or of any
Restricted Subsidiary repaid, repurchased, defeased or otherwise discharged with respect to the

the Issuer and the continuing Restricted Subsidiaries are no longer liable for such Indebtedness
after such sale);

(2) since the beginning of such period, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (by merger or
otherwise) has made an Investment in any Person that thereby becomes a Restricted Subsidiary,

operating unit of a business (any such Investment or acquisition, a “Purchase”), including any
such Purchase occurring in connection with a transaction causing a calculation to be made
hereunder, Consolidated EBITDA for such period will be calculated after giving pro forma effect
thereto as if such Purchase occurred on the first day of such period;

(3) since the beginning of such period, any Person (that became a Restricted Subsidiary or was
merged or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary since the
beginning of such period) will have made any Sale or any Purchase that would have required an
adjustment pursuant to clause (1) or (2) above if made by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
since the beginning of such period, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Interest Expense for
such period will be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such Sale or Purchase
occurred on the first day of such period;

(4) if the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary has incurred any Indebtedness since the beginning of
such period that remains outstanding or if the transaction giving rise to the need to calculate the
Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is an incurrence of Indebtedness or both,
Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Interest Expense for such period shall be calculated after
giving effect on a pro forma basis to such Indebtedness as if such Indebtedness had been
incurred on the first day of such period and the discharge of any other Indebtedness repaid,
repurchased, defeased or otherwise discharged with the proceeds of such new Indebtedness as
if such discharge had occurred on the first day of such period; provided, however, that, other than
for the purposes of the calculation of the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio under
clause (5) of the second paragraph under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness”, the pro forma calculation of the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall_
not give effect to (a) any Indebtedness incurred on the date of determination pursuant to the
provisions described in the second paragraph under the caption “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the discharge on the date of determination of any_
Indebtedness to the extent that such discharge results from the proceeds incurred pursuant to
the provisions described in the second paragraph under the caption “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Indebtedness”;_

(5) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the date of determination will be deemed to have
been a Restricted Subsidiary at all times during such period;

have been a Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such period; and

occurred at the beginning of the applicable period.

Taxes, Consolidated Interest Expense and Consolidated Net Income, calculations will be as
determined in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer of the Issuer (including,
to the extent applicable, in respect of cost savings and cost reduction synergies).

If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest, the interest expense on such Indebtedness shall

entire period (taking into account any Interest Rate Agreement applicable to such Indebtedness for a
period equal to the remaining term of such Interest Rate Agreement).

Restricted Subsidiary or secured by a Lien on the assets of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
(less any interest accrued on any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that was
funded with the proceeds of such Guaranteed Indebtedness).

Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, Consolidated Interest Expense shall not include (i) any interest
accrued, capitalized or paid in respect of Subordinated Shareholder Funding, (ii) any commissions,
discounts, yield and other fees and charges related to Qualified Receivables Financing and (iii) any

company, any business, or any group of assets constituting an operating unit of a business (any
such disposition, a “Sale”) or if the transaction giving rise to the need to calculate the
Consolidated Leverage Ratio is such a Sale, Consolidated EBITDA for such period will be
reduced by an amount equal to the Consolidated EBITDA (if positive) attributable to the assets
which are the subject of such Sale for such period or increased by an amount equal to the
Consolidated EBITDA (if negative) attributable thereto for such period; provided that if any such
sale constitutes “discontinued operations” in accordance with IFRS, Consolidated Net Income

including the issuance of Notes on the Issue Date and the use of proceeds thereof, as if they had
occurred at the beginning of the applicable period.

chief financial officer or any person performing a similarly senior accounting role of the Issuer
(regardless of whether these cost savings and cost reduction synergies could then be reflected in
_pro forma financial statements to the extent prepared)); and (b) in determining the amount of_
Indebtedness outstanding on any date of determination, _pro forma effect shall be given to any_

Indebtedness as if such transaction had occurred on the first day of the relevant period.

### BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM

**General**

Each series of the Notes sold to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A will initially be represented by a global
note in registered form without interest coupons attached (a “Rule 144A Global Note”). Each series
of the Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S will initially be represented by one
or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (a “Regulation S Global
**Note” and, together with the Rule 144A Global Note, the “Global Notes”). The Global Notes will be**
deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee
of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Regulation S prohibits initial purchasers of the Notes under Regulation S from offering, selling or
delivering the Notes within the United States or to or for the account or benefit of U.S. persons for the
period through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of the Offering and the
closing of the Offering (the “Distribution Compliance Period”). Beneficial interests in the Rule 144A
Global Notes may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Notes at any
time except in the circumstances described below. See “—Transfers.” In addition, transfers of
beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream, which may change from time to time.

Ownership of interests in a Rule 144A Global Note (the “Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and
ownership of interests in a Regulation S Global Note, as applicable (the “Regulation S Book-Entry
**Interests” and, together with the Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”), will be**
limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons that hold interests
through such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold Book-Entry Interests on behalf of their
participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their
respective depositaries. Except under the limited circumstances described below, Book-Entry Interests
will not be issued in definitive form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records
maintained by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The laws of some jurisdictions,
including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take
physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability
to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders
of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or “holders” of Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream (or
its nominee), as applicable, will be considered the sole holder of the Global Notes for all purposes
under the Indenture. In addition, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and
the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise
any rights of holders of Notes under the Indenture.

Neither the Issuer, the Principal Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor the Trustee will
have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the
amount received by them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price
payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount
received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such
Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that, under the existing practices of
Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of their Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear
and Clearstream will credit their participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to


-----

prevent fractions), by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate (including pool
factor), provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount may be
redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including
principal, premium, if any, interest and additional amounts, if any) to the Principal Paying Agent for
onward payment to Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will distribute such
payments to participants in accordance with their customary procedures. The Issuer will make
payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or
future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be
required by law and as described under “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes.” If any such
deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described under “Description of
_the Notes—Withholding Taxes,” the Issuer will pay additional amounts as may be necessary for the net_
amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such
deduction or withholding to equal the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise
received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such
withholding or deduction. The Issuer expects that standing customer instructions and customary
practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such
participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee and the agents will treat the registered holders
of the Global Notes (i.e., the common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream (or its nominee)) as the
owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none
of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Principal Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or any of their
respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

- any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect
participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

- Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or

- the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of the Euro
Notes and the SEK Floating Rate Notes will be paid to holders of Book-Entry Interests in such Global
Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream in euro or SEK, as applicable.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a
holder of a Note only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal
amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction.
Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the
taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under
the Notes, Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the holders of Book-Entry Interests in the
Global Notes, reserve the right to exchange the Global Notes for definitive registered notes in
certificated form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”), and to distribute such Definitive Registered
Notes to their participants.


-----

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with
Euroclear and Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of
Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for
any reason, including to sell Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes to persons in states that require
physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Notes must transfer its Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the
normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures set forth in
the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth under “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification
requirements discussed under “Notice to Investors.”

Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A BookEntry Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the
form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in compliance with
Regulation S or in accordance with Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act or any other exemption (if
available under the U.S. Securities Act).

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor
reasonably believes is a QIB in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in
accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance
with any applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule
144A Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal
amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the
Rule 144A Global Note and vice versa with respect to transfers involving an exchange of a Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interest for a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global
Note only as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange,” if required, only if
the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to
the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such
Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in
the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry
Interest in the first-mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global
Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures
applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a BookEntry Interest.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered
Notes:

(1) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as
depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days; or


-----

(2) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through
Euroclear or Clearstream following an event of default under the Indenture and enforcement
action is being taken in respect thereof under the Indenture.

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry
Interest described in the immediately preceding clause (2), their current procedure is to request that
the Issuer issue, or cause to be issued, Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry
Interests.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and
issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream or the
Issuer, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon
directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and
such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless
that legend is not required by such Indenture or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, each of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Principal Paying Agent, the Transfer
Agent and the Registrar shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the
absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such.
Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the
registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the
Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of
accounts in Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
as applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the
convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of the settlement system are controlled by
the settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither the Issuer nor any of the Initial
Purchasers is responsible for those operations or procedures.

The Issuer understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and
Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement
of securities transactions between their participants through electronic book-entry changes in
accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants,
including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of
internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets.
Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities
brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to
Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust
companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream
participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can act only on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf
of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such
interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream system, or
otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate
for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of
securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons
may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream
systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or
Clearstream participants.


-----

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed and admitted to trading on the
Irish Stock Exchange’s Global Exchange Market. Transfers of Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes
between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance
with their respective system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are
under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be
discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the
Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Principal Paying Agent will have any responsibility for the
performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their
respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in
registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear
and Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value
of the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear and Clearstream and will settle in
same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the
time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are
located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

### TAX CONSIDERATIONS

**Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations related to the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential
tax effects. This discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. holder (as defined below),
except for discussions on Additional Notes and on FATCA (as defined under “—Foreign Account Tax
_Compliance Act”), and does not address the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal_
income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. This
discussion is based upon the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury
regulations issued thereunder (the “Treasury Regulations”), and judicial and administrative
interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change,
possibly with retroactive effect. No rulings from the IRS have been or are expected to be sought with
respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different
position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or
that any such position would not be sustained.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant
to a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the unearned
income Medicare contribution tax or the alternative minimum tax, or to holders subject to special rules,
such as certain financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, dealers in securities or
currencies, traders in securities, U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, taxexempt entities, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other
pass through entities and investors in such entities, U.S. holders that are resident in or have a
permanent establishment in a jurisdiction outside the United States, U.S. holders that hold Notes
through non-U.S. brokers or other non-U.S. intermediaries and persons holding the Notes as part of a
“straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other integrated transaction. In addition, this
discussion is limited to persons who purchase Notes for cash pursuant to this offering at the offering
prices indicated on the cover page hereof and who hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning
of Section 1221 of the Code.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation
or any entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in or
under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) any estate the
income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) any trust if a
court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust
and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a
valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person.

If any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the U.S. tax
treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the
activities of the partnership. A partnership considering an investment in the Notes, and partners in such
a partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences
of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.

**_Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax_**
**_consequences of holding Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the_**
**_application of the U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed below, as well as the_**
**_application of other federal, state, local, foreign or other tax laws._**

**_Potential Contingent Payment Debt Treatment_**

The contingent obligation to pay additional amounts or redeem the notes early (including a redemption
in connection with the disposal of the Carveout Business) may implicate the provisions of the Treasury
Regulations relating to “contingent payment debt instruments.” We intend to take the position that the


-----

foregoing contingencies will not cause the notes to be treated as contingent payment debt
instruments. Our position is uncertain and is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS successfully takes a
contrary position, U.S. holders would generally be required to treat any gain recognized on the sale or
other disposition of the notes as ordinary income rather than as capital gain. Furthermore, U.S. holders
would be required to accrue interest income on a constant yield determined at the time of issuance of
the notes, with adjustments to such accruals when any contingent payments are made that differ from
the payments calculated based on the assumed yield. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors
regarding the tax consequences of the notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments.
The remainder of this discussion assumes that the notes are not treated as contingent payment debt
instruments.

**_Payments and accruals of stated interest_**

Payments and accruals of stated interest on the Notes (including any additional amounts paid in
respect of withholding taxes and without reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be
includible in the gross income of a U.S. holder as ordinary income at the time that such payments are
received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that
receives a payment of stated interest on the Notes will be required to include in income (as ordinary
income) the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency interest payment (determined based on the spot
rate on the date such payment is received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to
U.S. dollars at such time. A cash method U.S. holder will not recognize exchange gain or loss with
respect to the receipt of such stated interest, but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to
the actual disposition of the foreign currency so received.

A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be
required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the amount of stated interest
income in foreign currency that has accrued with respect to its Notes during an accrual period. The
U.S. dollar value of such accrued stated interest will be determined by translating such amount at the
average spot rate of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans
two taxable years, at the average spot rate of exchange for the partial period within each taxable year.
An accrual basis U.S. holder may elect, however, to translate such accrued stated interest income into
U.S. dollars using the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the interest accrual period or, with
respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, using the spot rate of exchange on the last
day of the portion of the accrual period within the relevant taxable year. Alternatively, if the last day of
an accrual period is within five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued stated interest, a
U.S. holder that has made the election described in the prior sentence may translate such interest
using the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt of the stated interest. The above election will
apply to other debt instruments held by an electing U.S. holder and may not be changed without the
consent of the IRS. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income
tax purposes will recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued stated interest income on
the date such interest is received. The amount of exchange gain or loss recognized will equal the
difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency payment received (determined
based on the spot rate on the date such stated interest is received) in respect of such accrual period
and the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest income that has accrued during such accrual period (as
determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time.
Any such exchange gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated, for
foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to
interest income or expense.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

The Notes may be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In
such event, U.S. holders generally will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary
income) for U.S. federal income tax purposes on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual


-----

method regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a
result, U.S. holders will generally include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash
attributable to such income.

The Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds their
issue price (as defined above) by an amount equal to or greater than a statutorily defined de minimis
amount (generally, 0.0025 multiplied by the stated principal amount and the number of complete years
to maturity from the issue date).

In the event that the Notes are issued with OID, the amount of OID with respect to a Note includible in
income by a U.S. holder is the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the Note for each day
during the taxable year or portion thereof in which such U.S. holder holds such Note. A daily portion
is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a _pro rata portion of the OID that_
accrued in such period. The accrual period of a Note may be of any length and may vary in length over
the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled
payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount
of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the Note’s
“adjusted issue price” at the beginning of such accrual period and its “yield to maturity,” determined
on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length
of such period, over (ii) the amount of stated interest allocable to such accrual period. With respect to
the Euro Floating Rate Notes and the SEK Floating Rate Notes, a U.S. holder that uses the accrual
method will include income interest on the Euro Floating Rate Notes or the SEK Floating Rate Notes
at the floating rate applicable for the first accrual period. The amount of interest income actually
recognized for any accrual period for the Euro Floating Rate Notes and SEK Floating Rate Notes will
increase or decrease if the actual amount of interest paid for such period is greater or lesser than the
interest accrued, as the case may be, based on the floating rate applicable for the first accrual period.
The adjusted issue price of a Note at the start of any accrual period is equal to its issue price, increased
by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period and decreased by the amount of any payments
previously made on the Notes that were not stated interest payments. The yield to maturity of a Note
is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all principal and interest
payments to be made under the Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the Note.

OID, if any, on the Notes will be determined for any accrual period in euro and then translated into U.S.
dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described above in the third paragraph
under “—Payments and accruals of stated interest.”

A U.S. holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon
the disposition of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously
included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the euro
payment received, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received, and
the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. For these
purposes, all receipts on a Note will be viewed first, as payment of stated interest payable on the Note;
second, as receipt of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made
for the earliest accrual periods first; and third, as receipt of principal. The rules governing OID
instruments are complex and prospective purchasers should consult their own tax advisors concerning
the application of such rules to the Notes as well as the interplay between the application of the OID
rules and the currency exchange gain or loss rules.

Foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss and be
treated, for foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss, and generally not as an
adjustment to interest income or expense.

**_Foreign tax credit_**

Stated interest income and OID, if any, on a Note generally will constitute foreign source income and
generally will be considered “passive category income” or, in the case of certain U.S. holders, “general
category income” in computing the foreign tax credit allowable to U.S. holders under U.S. federal


-----

income tax laws. There are significant complex limitations on a U.S. holder’s ability to claim foreign tax
credits. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the creditability or deductibility of any
withholding taxes.

**_Sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder
generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized upon
such disposition (less any amount equal to any accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be
taxable as stated interest income as discussed above to the extent not previously included in income
by the U.S. holder) and such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note.

A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will, in general, be the cost of such Note to such U.S.
holder, decreased by payments on the Note other than stated interest and increased by any OID
previously accrued by such U.S. holder with respect to such Note. The cost of a Note purchased with
foreign currency will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price on the
date of purchase, calculated at the exchange rate in effect on that date.

If a U.S. holder receives foreign currency on such a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other
taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of
such foreign currency translated at the spot rate on the date of taxable disposition. In the case of a
Note that is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder and,
if so elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder will determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency
by translating such amount at the spot rate on the settlement date of the disposition. The special
election available to accrual basis U.S. holders in regard to the purchase and disposition of Notes
traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held
by the U.S. holder and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. holder
that does not make the special settlement date election will recognize exchange gain or loss to the
extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date.

Gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition
of a Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal
amount of such Note generally will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be
treated as interest income or expense. Gain or loss attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange
rates with respect to the principal amount of a Note generally will equal the difference, if any, between
the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Note, determined at
the spot rate on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition,
and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Note, determined
at the spot rate on the date the U.S. holder purchased the Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder may recognize exchange
gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest and
accrued OID, if any, which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments and accruals of
_stated interest” or “—Original Issue Discount,” as applicable. However, upon a sale, exchange,_
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder will recognize any
exchange gain or loss (including with respect to accrued interest) only to the extent of total gain or loss
realized by such U.S. holder on such disposition.

Any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable
disposition of a Note in excess of exchange gain or loss attributable to such disposition generally will
be U.S. source gain or loss and generally will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of non-corporate
U.S. holders (including individuals) derived in respect of capital assets held for more than one year are
generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
limitations.

**_Additional Notes_**

The Issuer may issue Additional Notes as described under “Description of the Notes.” These Additional
Notes, even if they are treated for non-tax purposes as part of the same series as the Notes, in some


-----

cases may be treated as a series separate from such Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In
such case, the Additional Notes may be considered to have been issued with OID (or a greater amount
of OID) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which may adversely affect the market value of the Notes,
if the Additional Notes are not otherwise distinguishable from the Notes.

**_Information reporting and backup withholding_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of stated interest (including the
accrual of OID, if any) on the Notes and to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a
retirement or redemption) of a Note paid to a U.S. holder unless such U.S. holder is an exempt
recipient, and, when required, provides evidence of such exemption. Backup withholding may apply
to such payments if the U.S. holder fails to provide a taxpayer identification number or a certification
that it is not subject to backup withholding.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding
rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability
provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Tax return disclosure requirements_**

Treasury Regulations that require the reporting to the IRS of certain tax shelter transactions cover
certain transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign currency
transactions giving rise to losses in excess of a certain minimum amount, such as the receipt or accrual
of interest on or a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a foreign
currency note or foreign currency received in respect of a foreign currency note. U.S. holders should
consult their tax advisors to determine the tax return disclosure obligations, if any, with respect to an
investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction
Disclosure Statement).

Individuals that own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in excess of certain
thresholds generally are required to file an information report (IRS Form 8938) with respect to such
assets with their tax returns. The Notes generally will constitute specified foreign financial assets
subject to these reporting requirements, unless the Notes are held in certain accounts maintained by
certain financial institutions. Under certain circumstances, an entity may be treated as an individual for
purposes of these rules.

U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing
disclosure requirements to their ownership of the Notes, including the significant penalties for noncompliance.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Legislation referred to as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”) generally may impose
withholding at a rate of 30% on payments made after December 31, 2018 to any foreign entity on debt
obligations issued by a foreign financial institution that (i) enters into certain agreements with the IRS
or (ii) becomes subject to provisions of local law intended to implement an intergovernmental
agreement entered into pursuant to FATCA, in each case, to the extent such payments are attributable
to U.S. source income, unless the foreign entity receiving such payments complies with various U.S.
information reporting and/or due diligence requirements (generally relating to ownership by U.S.
persons of interests in or accounts with such foreign entity) or otherwise qualifies for an exemption.
Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable final
regulations defining foreign passthru payments are filed generally would be “grandfathered” unless
materially modified after such date. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution,
FATCA would apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Notes for
U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering period. However, if
Additional Notes (as described under “Description of the Notes”) are issued after the expiration of the
grandfathering period, have the same Common Code or ISIN as the Notes and are subject to
withholding under FATCA, then withholding agents may treat all notes in such series, including the


-----

relevant Notes, as subject to withholding under FATCA. Non-U.S. governments have entered into
agreements with the United States (and additional non-U.S. governments are expected to enter into
such agreements) to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein. Holders
should consult their own tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes.
In the event any withholding under FATCA is imposed with respect to any payments on the Notes, there
will be no additional amounts payable to compensate for the withheld amount.

**Certain Norwegian Tax Considerations**

The following is a general presentation of certain Norwegian tax consequences resulting from the
acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Notes. The description below is based on the assumption
that the Notes are considered as debt instruments for tax purposes. This presentation does not purport
to be a comprehensive description of all tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to
purchase the Notes. In particular, this presentation does not consider any specific facts or
circumstances that may apply to a particular purchaser subject to special tax regimes, such as banks,
insurance companies or tax-exempt organizations. This summary is based on the laws currently in
force and as applied on the date of this offering memorandum in the Kingdom of Norway which are
subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.

The tax treatment of each holder partly depends on the holder’s specific situation, and the specific
instrument issued to the holder. Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own
tax advisors as to the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes,
including the effect of any state or local taxes under the tax laws applicable in the kingdom of Norway
and each country of which they are residents or whose tax laws apply to them for other reasons.

Please note that for the purpose of the summary below, a reference to a Norwegian or non-Norwegian
holder of Notes refers to the tax residency and not the nationality of the holder.

**_Taxation of Interest_**

_Norwegian holders of Notes_

Both corporate and individual holders of Notes who are tax residents of Norway are subject to
Norwegian tax on interest received at a flat tax rate currently at 24% (2017). For Norwegian holders
holding Notes issued with a discount (compared to the nominal value) such discount will be taxed in
the year of the realization of the Notes.

Any interest received in foreign currency is converted to Norwegian kroner when calculating the
taxable interest income.

_Non-Norwegian holders of Notes_

In general, payments of interest on Notes issued to holders who are not tax residents of Norway are
not subject to Norwegian tax. Payments to non-Norwegian holders of Notes may therefore be made
without any withholding tax or deduction for any Norwegian taxes, duties, assessments or
governmental charges.

If the Notes are held by an individual or by a company not tax resident of Norway, that is performing
business activities in Norway, and the Notes are effectively connected with such business activities in
Norway, interest received will be taxed in Norway with a tax rate of 24% (2017).

_Withholding tax on interest_

Norway does not apply withholding tax on interest payments or repayments of the principal. However,
the Ministry of Finance has stated that a consultation paper relating to introduction of withholding tax
on interest payments will be submitted for consultation during summer 2017. Such internal legal rule
is expected to enter info force at the earliest from fiscal year 2018.


-----

Many tax treaties currently restrict Norway’s ability to effectively impose withholding tax on interest. A
withholding tax will however, if implemented, take full effect in relation to states which Norway do not
have a tax treaty.

**_Taxation of capital gains or losses on disposal of Notes_**

_Norwegian holders of Notes_

Capital gains realized by Norwegian holders of Notes upon the sale, disposal or other redemption of
Notes will be subject to Norwegian taxation at the rate of 24% (2017). Corresponding losses will be tax
deductible.

The taxable gain or deductible loss is calculated for each Note and is, in broad terms, equal to the
sales price less the Norwegian Notes holders’ cost price of the Note, including costs incurred in
relation to the acquisition or realization of the Note. Any gain received in foreign currency when
realizing Notes is converted to Norwegian kroner when calculating the taxable gain.

_Non-Norwegian holders of Notes_

Capital gains realized by non-Norwegian holders of Notes upon the sale, disposal or other redemption
of Notes are normally not subject to Norwegian tax. Corresponding losses will generally not be tax
deductible.

Such capital gains may be taxable in Norway if the non-Norwegian holder of Notes is performing a
business activity in Norway or such business is conducted in Norway and the Notes are effectively
connected with such business activity.

**_Net Wealth Tax_**

_Corporate holders_

Both Norwegian and non-Norwegian corporate holders of Notes are exempt from Norwegian net
wealth tax.

_Individual holders_

Individual holders of Notes who are tax residents of Norway are liable to Norwegian net wealth tax. The
value of the Notes is included in the basis for the computation of net wealth tax imposed on such
holders of Notes. The value for assessment purposes for listed Notes is the listed value as of 1 January
in the year of assessment. Unlisted Notes will normally be valued at face value as of 1 January in the
year of assessment. Currently, the marginal net wealth tax rate is 0.85% of the taxpayer’s net wealth.

Non-resident individual holders of Notes are not liable to pay net wealth tax in Norway on the value of
the Notes unless Notes are effectively connected with a business that the individual holder of Notes
carries out in Norway or such business is conducted from Norway.

_Stamp duty_

There is currently no stamp duty or other charges in Norway on the purchase, sale or realization of
Notes.

_Inheritance tax_

Norway does not impose inheritance tax or a similar tax on inheritance or gifts. However, the recipient
acquires the donor’s tax input value of Notes based on principles of continuity. Thus, the recipient will
be taxable for any increase in value in the donor’s ownership, at the time of the recipient’s realization
of the Notes.

_VAT_

Transactions regarding Notes are exempt from Norwegian value added tax.

**Swedish Tax Considerations**

The following is a summary of certain Swedish tax consequences which may result from this offer and
refers only to private individuals and legal entities that are tax resident and/or domiciled in Sweden
(including permanent establishments) unless otherwise stated. The summary is based on current
Swedish tax regulations and is intended merely as general information. The tax treatment of each note
holder is partly dependent on that person’s particular situation. Special tax consequences which are
not described below may apply to certain categories of taxpayers. For example, the description does
not cover notes held as current assets by a business or held by partnerships, investment companies
or investment funds. Each holder of the Notes should consult a tax adviser on the special tax
consequences the offer may entail in each particular case, including, for foreign note holders the
applicability of foreign income tax rules and provisions contained in tax treaties and other rules which
may be applicable.

_Withholding Tax_

Sweden does not apply withholding tax to interest payments or repayments of the principal. However,
a Swedish legal entity or permanent establishment (e.g. a guarantor) effecting an interest payment to
an individual tax resident in Sweden (or an estate of a deceased resident individual) will normally be
required to withhold Swedish preliminary tax (Sw. preliminärskatt) on the payment. The preliminary tax
so withheld is normally equal to the final tax on the interest income, which means that there is generally
no further tax payable on the interest payments made by the Issuer.

**_Taxes on Income and Capital Gains_**

_Private individuals_

Private individual tax residents in Sweden, and estates of deceased individuals, tax resident in Sweden,
will be taxed at a rate of 30% on interest income as well as any capital and foreign exchange gains
arising in case the Notes are sold or redeemed. Capital gains will be taxed upon the sale or
redemption. Repayment of the principal amount will not be taxed.

Capital losses are deductible against capital income. Capital losses incurred from the sale or
redemption of listed securities (e.g. notes that are listed) can be fully offset against taxable capital
gains occurring in the same year due to the sale of listed shares and listed securities (with the
exception of shares in investment funds holding only Swedish receivables, known as Swedish fixed
income funds). In case of excess loss, 70% of this loss is deductible against other capital income. In
case of a net capital loss, such loss may be used for tax reduction on earned income tax as well as
central government and municipal property taxes. Tax reduction is granted with 30% of the net capital
loss up to SEK 100,000 and 21% of any loss exceeding SEK 100,000. Note that if the taxable individual
has made/makes an investment deduction (Sw. _Investeraravdrag) in the same fiscal year, the_
calculation will differ. Tax losses cannot be carried forward to future income years.

The capital gain or loss is computed as the difference between the sales price (or redemption
remuneration) after deduction for sales expenses and the cost basis. The cost basis is determined
according to the “average method” (Sw. Genomsnittsmetoden), i.e., somewhat simplified, the
acquisition value for the Notes of the same class and type added together taking into account any
changes in the holding.

In case the Notes are held in a Swedish investment savings account (Sw. Investeringssparkonto) or a
Swedish endowment insurance (Sw. Kapitalförsäkring) the taxation may differ. Please find a brief
description of the said holding options below.

The holder of a Swedish investment savings account can only be a natural person or the estate of a
deceased individual. No tax is due on the results of an investment savings account. Instead a standard
amount is taxed as capital income. The standard amount of income is calculated by the party that
provides the account (e.g. a bank, investment firm etc.) and this is reported as income of capital in the
tax return of the person liable to pay tax. The standard amount is calculated in two steps. First the
capital base is calculated and then a standard amount of income is calculated which is reported as


-----

capital income in the tax return. The capital base is calculated annually and in somewhat simplified
terms comprises one quarter of the value of the assets on the account at the beginning of each quarter.
However, the capital base must be increased by a value equivalent to the deposits to the account and
the transfers of securities to the account during the respective quarter. The standard amount of income
is derived by multiplying the capital base, as described above, by the government borrowing rate at
the end of November the year before the fiscal year increased with 0.75 percentage points, but no less
than 1.25%. The standard amount of income is reported as capital income and taxed at 30%.

The holder of a _Swedish endowment insurance_ is not liable to pay special tax on returns (Sw.
_avkastningsskatt). Instead it is the life insurance company providing the insurance which is liable for_
any special tax on returns. However, please note that the holder of a foreign endowment insurance may
be obliged to pay special tax on returns in Sweden. This depends on the country of residence for the
assurer and if the assurer has a permanent establishment in Sweden. Special tax on returns is not
charged on the capital gains, but on a standard calculated amount. The standard calculated amount
used for special tax on returns purposes is calculated in two steps. First a capital base is calculated
and thereafter a standard calculated amount on this capital is calculated. The capital base constitutes,
somewhat simplified, the value of the insurance at the beginning of the fiscal year. The capital base
should however also be increased by a value equivalent to the sum of any premiums paid during the
fiscal year. However, when calculating this amount, only half of the premiums paid during the second
half of the fiscal year should be included. The standard calculated amount is derived by multiplying the
capital base, as described above, by the government borrowing rate at the end of November the year
before the fiscal year increased with 0.75 percentage points, but no less than 1.25%. The special tax
on returns amounts to 30% of the standard calculated amount.

Private individuals who are not tax resident in Sweden are not subject to Swedish taxation on interest
or capital gains on the Notes.

_Limited liability companies_

Limited liability companies are subject to tax on all income due to, inter alia, a sale or redemption, i.e.
including capital as well as foreign exchange gains, as business income, at a rate of 22%. Business
income is in general taxed on an accrual basis. Repayment of the principal amount will not be taxed,
unless it was bought for a lesser amount (discounted notes).

Capital losses arising in case the Notes are sold or redeemed are generally fully deductible against all
business income. However, losses may not be deductible in case the holder of the Notes and the
Issuer of the Notes are considered related parties. Tax losses may, subject to certain restrictions in
case of a change of ownership or mergers, be carried forward indefinitely.

Please note that specific rules may apply in case the Notes are held as a hedge for foreign currency
exposures.

A Swedish limited liability company may also hold assets in a Swedish endowment insurance. Please
refer to description above under Private individuals.

A non-Swedish legal entity is not subject to tax in Sweden on interest or capital gains on the Notes,
provided that the legal entity does not have a permanent establishment in Sweden through which the
Notes are connected.

_Gift or Inheritance Taxes_

Sweden has currently no gift or inheritance tax.

_Value Added Tax_

No VAT is levied in relation to the investment in the Notes.

_Other Taxes and Duties_

No other taxes or duties other than mentioned above should be applicable.


-----

**Certain United Kingdom Tax Considerations**

The following is a general description of certain UK tax consequences relating to the Notes and is
based on current UK tax law and HM Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) published practice, both of which
may be subject to change, possibly with retrospective effect. It does not purport to be a complete
analysis of all UK tax considerations relating to the Notes, does not purport to constitute legal or tax
advice, relates only to persons who are the absolute beneficial owners of Notes and who hold Notes
as a capital investment, and does not deal with certain classes of persons (such as brokers or dealers
in securities and persons connected with the Issuer) to whom special rules may apply.

Prospective noteholders should consult their own tax advisors on the UK tax consequences of owning
and disposing of the Notes in their particular circumstances.

_Stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax (“SDRT”)_

No liability to UK stamp duty will arise on the issue of the Notes to holders. We understand that no
register of the Notes will be maintained in the UK and, accordingly, (i) UK stamp duty will not normally
be payable in connection with a transfer of the Notes, provided that any instrument of transfer is
executed and retained outside the UK and no other action is taken in the UK by the transferor or
transferee, and (ii) no UK SDRT will be payable in respect of the issue of or any agreement to transfer
the Notes. In any event, the Notes are expected to fall within an exemption for debt instruments, so
there should be no charge to UK stamp duty or SDRT for a purchaser on any subsequent transfer of
the Notes.

_Information Reporting_

Information relating to securities may be required to be provided to HMRC in certain circumstances.
This may include the value of the securities, details of the holders or beneficial owners of the securities
(or the persons for whom the securities are held), details of the persons to whom payments derived
from the securities are or may be paid and information and documents in connection with transactions
relating to the securities. Information may be required to be provided by, amongst others, the holders
of the securities, persons by (or via) whom payments derived from the securities are made or who
receive (or would be entitled to receive) such payments, persons who effect or are a party to
transactions relating to the securities on behalf of others and certain registrars or administrators.

In certain circumstances, the information obtained by HMRC may be provided to tax authorities in other
countries.

### CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS

**General**

The U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) imposes certain requirements
on “employee benefit plans” (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) subject to Title I of ERISA and on
entities that are deemed to hold the assets of such plans (collectively, “ERISA Plans”), and on those
persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to
ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including, but not limited to, the requirement of investment
prudence and diversification and the requirement that an ERISA Plan’s investments be made in
accordance with the documents governing the plan.

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets
of an ERISA Plan (as well as those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section
4975 of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts (together with ERISA Plans, “Plans”) and
certain persons (who are “parties in interest” within the meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, or
“disqualified persons” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code) having certain relationships to
such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. A party in
interest or disqualified person who engages in a prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes
and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or the Code.

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the
administration of an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of an ERISA Plan, or
who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation (direct or indirect) to an ERISA Plan,
is generally considered to be a fiduciary of such ERISA Plan. Any Plan fiduciary which proposes to
cause a Plan to purchase the Notes should consult with its counsel regarding the applicability of the
fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code
to such an investment, and to confirm that such purchase and holding will not constitute or result in a
non-exempt prohibited transaction or any other violation of an applicable requirement of ERISA, the
Code or any Similar Law (as defined below).

Non-U.S. plans, (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), “governmental plans” (as defined in
Section 3(32) of ERISA) and certain “church plans” (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA), while not
subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA or the prohibited transaction
provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to nonU.S., state, local or other federal laws or regulations that are substantially similar to the foregoing
provisions of ERISA and the Code (collectively, “Similar Law”). Fiduciaries of any such plans should
consult with their counsel before purchasing the Notes to determine the need for, and the availability,
if necessary, of any exemptive relief under any such law or regulations.

**Prohibited Transaction Exemptions**

The fiduciary of a Plan that proposes to purchase and hold any Notes should consider, among other
things, whether such purchase and holding may involve (i) the direct or indirect extension of credit to
a party in interest or a disqualified person, (ii) the sale or exchange of any property between a Plan and
a party in interest or a disqualified person, or (iii) the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party
in interest or disqualified person, of any Plan assets. Such parties in interest or disqualified persons
could include, without limitation, the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer Agents or
any of their respective affiliates. Depending on the satisfaction of certain conditions which may include
the identity of the Plan fiduciary making the decision to acquire or hold the Notes on behalf of a Plan,
Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA, Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code or Prohibited Transaction Class
Exemption (“PTCE”) 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by an “independent qualified professional
asset manager”), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate
accounts), PTCE 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 95-60
(relating to investments by insurance company general accounts) or PTCE 96-23 (relating to
transactions directed by an in-house asset manager) (collectively, the “Class Exemptions”) could
provide an exemption from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the


-----

Code. However, there can be no assurance that any of these Class Exemptions or any other exemption
will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes, or that all of the
conditions for any such exemption will be satisfied.

**The foregoing is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive. Each Plan fiduciary**
**(and each fiduciary for non-U.S., governmental or church plans subject to Similar Law) should**
**consult with its legal advisor concerning the potential consequences to the plan under ERISA,**
**the Code or such Similar Laws of an investment in the Notes.**

**Nothing set forth herein constitutes a recommendation that any person take or refrain from**
**taking any course of action within the meaning of U.S. Department of Labor Regulation §2510.3-**
**21(b)(1).**


-----

### PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”)
to be dated as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer has agreed to sell the Notes to the
Initial Purchasers and the Initial Purchasers have agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase the
Notes from the Issuer.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers are obligated, severally and not jointly, to
purchase all the Notes, if any are purchased. In the event that an Initial Purchaser fails or refuses to
purchase the Notes which it has agreed to purchase, the Purchase Agreement provides that the
purchase commitments of the other Initial Purchasers may be increased up to a specified amount or
that the Purchase Agreement may be terminated.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by
counsel.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page
hereof. After the initial offering, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to
time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice.

We have agreed to provide the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees or discounts for their services
in connection with the offering of the Notes and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and
other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the
offering price set forth on the cover page hereof.

The Purchase Agreement provides that we will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to
payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed,
subject to certain limited exceptions, not to offer, sell, contract to sell, issue or otherwise dispose of,
except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the
Company during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date
that is 90 days after the date of the Purchase Agreement.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers
have agreed that they will only offer or sell the Notes: (i) in the United States to “qualified institutional
buyers” within the meaning of Rule 144A; and (ii) outside the United States in offshore transactions to
non-U.S. persons in compliance with Regulation S. Until 40 days after the commencement of the
offering of the Notes, an offer or sale of Notes within the United States by a broker-dealer (whether or
not it is participating in the offering of the Notes) may violate the registration requirements of the U.S.
Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144A. In addition, as Nordea
Bank AB (publ) and Nykredit Bank A/S and their affiliates are not registered with the SEC as U.S.
registered broker-dealers, it will effect offers and sales of the Notes solely outside of the United States.
Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Rule 144A and Regulation S, as
applicable. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed with us that:

(i) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause
to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the
meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any
Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to us, and

(ii) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to
anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.


-----

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by
us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession,
circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes
in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered
or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or
advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country
or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or
jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer
to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose
possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe
any restrictions relating to the offering of the Notes, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and
resale of the Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

The Issuer has also agreed that it will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise
dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge,
contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities
Act or the safe harbor of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of
the Notes.

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there is currently no market. We will apply for the
Notes to be admitted to the Official List of the Exchange; however, we cannot assure you that the Notes
will be approved for listing or that such listing will be obtained, or if obtained, will be maintained.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market for the Notes as permitted by
applicable law after completing the offering of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated,
however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any
time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making
activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act. We
cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or
that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you.
See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—There may not be an active trading market for the
_Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date
specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be six business days (as such
term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the
Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+6”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act,
trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in three business days unless the
parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the
Notes on the date of pricing or the next two succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the
fact that the Notes initially will settle in T+6, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any
such trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes on the
date of pricing and the next two succeeding business days should consult their own advisors.

In connection with the offering of the Notes, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf,
may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes.
Specifically, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes
in the open market to stabilize the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its
behalf, may also over-allot the offering of the Notes, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid
for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the
Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in market-making
transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities
may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may
otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end
these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading


-----

markets for, the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—There may not be an active
_trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in
various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial
advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities.
The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may
provide in the future investment banking, financial advisory and commercial banking services to us and
our affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which they have received or may receive customary
fees and commissions, including in connection with the Transactions and the related bridge facility
commitments. In connection with our strategy to review and evaluate selective acquisitions, coinvestment arrangements and other business combinations, we and our shareholders regularly engage
mergers and acquisition advisors and other financial advisors to assist us. Certain of the Initial
Purchasers and their affiliates may be currently advising us or other interested parties, and the Initial
Purchasers and their affiliates may advise us or other interested parties from time to time on other
transactions in the future. The Initial Purchasers may also, from time to time, hold bonds or loans of, or
acquire equity positions in the Issuer and its subsidiaries and affiliates in normal course, including
allocations of the Notes, the Lindorff Existing Debt, the Intrum Justitia Existing MTNs, the Intrum Justitia
Existing Private Placement Bonds or the Intrum Justitia Existing Commercial Paper Program. The Initial
Purchasers and their affiliates may, from time to time, engage in transactions with, and perform services
for, the Issuer and its subsidiaries and affiliates in the ordinary course of their business. The Issuer
and/or Lindorff currently provide debt collection and related services to certain of the Initial Purchasers
and/or their affiliates and may continue to provide such services in the future.

Goldman Sachs International and/or certain of its affiliates acted as financial advisors to the previous
owners of the Lindorff AB and its subsidiaries and/or its boards in connection with the Prior Lindorff
Acquisition. Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch and/or certain of its affiliates acted as financial advisors
to Nordic Capital Fund VIII in connection with the Prior Lindorff Acquisition. Morgan Stanley & Co.
International plc and/or certain of its affiliates acted as advisors to Nordic Capital and/or certain of its
affiliates in connection with the Merger. J.P. Morgan Securities plc and/or certain of its affiliates acted as
advisors to the Issuer and its subsidiaries in connection with the Merger. Affiliates of each of Deutsche
Bank AG, London Branch and Nordea Bank AB (publ) have in the past and may in the future sell
portfolios of overdue debt and other overdue receivables to members of the Company. UBS Limited
and/or certain of its affiliates acted as financial advisors to Lindorff in connection with certain coinvestment arrangements entered into by Lindorff. Nordea Bank AB (publ) or one of its affiliates is a
lender under the Lindorff Existing Loan Note Issuance Deed and is also a lender to certain members of
Lindorff management who participate in its management incentive program. Nordea Bank AB (publ),
DNB Bank ASA and Nykredit Bank A/S are lenders under the Lindorff Existing Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and as a result will receive a portion of the proceeds of the offering of the Notes. Certain
affiliates of Nordea Bank AB (publ) and Goldman Sachs International are lenders under the Lindorff and
Nordea Bilateral Facility Agreement and the Lindorff and GS Bilateral Facility Agreement, respectively,
and as a result will receive a portion of the proceeds of the offering of the Notes. Certain affiliates of
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch and DNB Bank ASA are lenders under certain of the Aktua Facility
Agreements and as a result will receive a portion of the proceeds of the offering of the Notes. Nordea
Bank AB (publ) and Swedbank AB (publ) or certain of their affiliates are lenders under the Intrum Justitia
Existing Revolving Credit Facility and as a result will receive a portion of the proceeds of the offering of
the Notes. Certain of the Initial Purchasers will be lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are or may be in the future party to certain
of our hedging arrangements and other financing and/or debt arrangements and may hold other
proprietary positions in us, our current or future subsidiaries and affiliates and/or financial
intermediaries and the financial instruments issued by any of them.

### TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS

You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of
any of the Notes offered hereby.

We have not registered and will not register the Notes under the U.S. Securities Act and, therefore, the
Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in
a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. Accordingly, we
are offering and selling the Notes to the Initial Purchasers for re-offer and resale only:

- to U.S. investors that we reasonably believe to be “qualified institutional buyers,” (“QIBs”) (as
defined in Rule 144A) in compliance with Rule 144A; and

- outside the United States in offshore transactions to non-U.S. persons in compliance with
Regulation S.

We use the terms “offshore transaction” and “United States” with the meanings given to them in
Regulation S.

Each purchaser of Notes, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged,
represented to and agreed with the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

(1) It understands and acknowledges that the Notes have not been registered under the U.S.
Securities Act or any other applicable state securities laws, and that the Notes are being offered
for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the U.S. Securities Act or any state
securities law, including sales in reliance on Rule 144A, and, unless so registered, may not be
offered, sold or otherwise transferred except in compliance with the registration requirements of
the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable state securities laws, pursuant to an exemption
therefrom or in any transaction not subject thereto, and in each case in compliance with the
conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) below.

(2) It is not an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144) of the Issuer or acting on behalf of the Issuer and
it is either:

(i) a QIB and is aware that any sale of Notes to it will be made in reliance on Rule 144A, and
the acquisition of Notes will be for its own account or for the account of a party that is a
QIB; or

(ii) a non-U.S. person purchasing the Notes in an offshore transaction in compliance with
Regulation S.

(3) It acknowledges that none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Principal Paying Agent, the Transfer
Agent, the Registrar or the Initial Purchasers, or any person representing any of them, have
made any representation to it with respect to the offering or sale of the Notes, other than the
information contained in this Offering Memorandum, which Offering Memorandum has been
delivered to it and upon which it is relying in making its investment decision with respect to the
Notes. It has had access to such financial and other information concerning us, the Issuer and
its subsidiaries and the Notes as it has deemed necessary in connection with its decision to
purchase any of the Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of, and request information
from, the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers.

(4) It is purchasing the Notes for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which it
is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer
or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the U.S. Securities Act or any
state securities laws, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the
property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and
subject to its or their ability to resell such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other
exemption from registration available under the U.S. Securities Act.


-----

(5) Each holder of Notes sold in reliance on Rule 144A (the “Rule 144A Notes”) agrees on its own
behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is purchasing the Rule 144A Notes, as
applicable, and each subsequent holder of the Rule 144A Notes by its acceptance thereof will
be deemed to agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Notes prior to the date (the “Resale
**Restriction Termination Date”) that is one year after the later of the date of the Issue Date and**
the last date on which the Issuer or any of its affiliates was the owner of such Notes, as the case
may be, (or any predecessor thereto) only: (i) to the Issuer or any subsidiary thereof; (ii)
pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared effective under the U.S. Securities
Act; (iii) for so long as the Notes are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person it
reasonably believes is a QIB who purchases for its own account or for the account of a QIB to
whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A; (iv) pursuant to
offers and sales that occur outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in compliance with
Regulation S; or (v) pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration requirements
of the U.S. Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of law that
the disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times
within its or their control and in compliance with any applicable state securities laws, and any
applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject to the Issuer’s and the Trustee’s rights
prior to any such offer, sale or transfer: (i) pursuant to clause (iv) or (v) to require the delivery of
an opinion of counsel, certification and/or other information satisfactory to each of them; and (b)
in each of the foregoing cases, to require that a certificate of transfer in the form appearing on
the reverse of the security is completed and delivered by the transferor to the Trustee. The
foregoing restrictions on resale will not apply subsequent to the Resale Restriction Termination
Date.

(6) The purchaser understands that, by its purchase, holding and disposition of the Notes or any
interest therein, it shall be deemed to have represented and covenanted that, either (a) it is not
acquiring the Notes or any interest therein for or on behalf of (and for so long as it holds the
Notes or any interest therein will not be and will not be acting on behalf of) (i) any “employee
benefit plan” (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (“ERISA”)) that is subject to Title I of ERISA, (ii) any “plan” (as defined in
Section 4975(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)) that is
subject to Section 4975 of the Code, (iii) any entity the assets of which are considered to include
“plan assets” of any plans described above in subsections (i) or (ii) (within the meaning of U.S.
Department of Labor Regulation 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as amended by Section 3(42) of
ERISA), or (iv) any plan, such as a foreign plan (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA),
governmental plan (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA) or church plan (as defined in Section
3(33) of ERISA or Section 4975(g)(3) of the Code) that is not subject to Title I of ERISA but that
is subject to any federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are similar to Title
I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (a “Similar Law”) (each a “Plan”), or (b) (i) the
acquisition, holding and disposition of the Notes or any interest therein are exempt from the
prohibited transaction restrictions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code (or in
the case of a plan that is subject to a Similar Law, exempt from the analogous provisions of such
Similar Law), pursuant to one or more applicable statutory or administrative exemptions and (ii)
if it is a Plan which is subject to ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, the decision to purchase
the Notes has been made by a duly authorized fiduciary (each, a “Plan Fiduciary”) who is
independent of the Issuer and its affiliates, which Plan Fiduciary (A) is a fiduciary under ERISA
or the Code, or both, with respect to the decision to purchase the Notes, (B) is not the individual
retirement account (“IRA”) owner (in the case of a purchaser which is an IRA), (C) is capable of
evaluating investment risks independently, both in general and with regard to the prospective
investment in the Notes, (D) has exercised independent judgment in evaluating whether to invest
the assets of such Plan in the Notes, and (E) is either a bank, an insurance carrier, a registered
investment adviser, a registered broker-dealer or an independent fiduciary with at least $50
million of assets under management or control; provided, however, that Plans will not be
deemed to make the representations in this clause b(ii) to the extent that the regulations under


-----

Section 3(21) of ERISA issued by the U.S. Department of Labor on April 8, 2016 are rescinded
or otherwise are not implemented in their current form.

IMPLEMENTED IN THEIR CURRENT FORM.

The following legend shall also be included, if applicable:

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS SUPPLIED SOLELY FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX
PURPOSES. THIS NOTE WAS ISSUED WITH ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT (“OID”) WITHIN THE
MEANING OF SECTION 1273 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED
(THE “CODE”), AND THIS LEGEND IS REQUIRED BY SECTION 1275(c) OF THE CODE.

If it purchases Notes, it will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions apply
to holders of beneficial interests in the Notes, as well as to holders of the Notes.

(8) It agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers the Notes notice of any restrictions
on transfer of such Notes.

(9) It acknowledges that until 40 days after the commencement of the offering of the Notes, any offer
or sale of the Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the
offering of the Notes) may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such
offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A.

(10) If it is a non-U.S. person in a sale that occurs outside the United States within the meaning of
Regulation S, it acknowledges that until the expiration of the “distribution compliance period” (as
defined below), it shall not make any offer or sale of the Notes to a U.S. person or for the account
or benefit of a U.S. person within the meaning of Rule 902 under the U.S. Securities Act. The
“distribution compliance period” means the 40-day period following the issue date for the Notes.

(11) It acknowledges that the Registrar will not be required to accept for registration or transfer any
Notes acquired by it except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to the Issuer and the
Registrar that the restrictions set forth therein have been complied with.

(12) It acknowledges that the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the
Registrar and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing acknowledgements,

representations, warranties and agreements deemed to have been made by its purchase of the
Notes is no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify the Initial Purchasers. If it is acquiring any
Notes as a fiduciary or an agent for one or more investor accounts, it represents that it has sole
investment discretion with respect to each such investor account and that it has full power to
make the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf of each
such investor account.

(13) It understands that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by
the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would result in a public offering of the Notes or the
possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material
relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for such purpose is required.
Consequently, any transfer of the Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set forth under
“Plan of Distribution.”

(14) If you are a purchaser in a sale that occurs outside the United States within the meaning of
Regulation S, you acknowledge that until the expiration of the “distribution compliance period”

the account or benefit of a U.S. person within the meaning of Rule 902 under the U.S. Securities

### ENFORCEMENT OF FOREIGN JUDGMENTS AND SERVICE OF PROCESS

The Issuer is a public limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Sweden.

Many of our directors, officers and other executives are neither residents nor citizens of the United
States. Furthermore, most of our assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not
be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon such persons or us
or to enforce against them or us judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions
of U.S. federal or state securities laws despite the fact that, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, we
have appointed, or will appoint, an agent for the service of process in New York. It may be possible for
investors to effect service of process within Sweden upon those persons or us or over our subsidiaries
provided that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents
in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer, investors will need to enforce such
judgment in jurisdictions where the Issuer has assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S. court
judgments outside the United States is described below for Sweden, you should consult with your own
advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in Sweden or elsewhere
outside the United States.

**Sweden**

It is not established by Swedish judicial precedent or otherwise by Swedish law that a power of
attorney or a mandate of agency, including the appointment of a service of process agent, can be
made irrevocable and therefore any powers of attorney or mandates of agency issued by a Swedish
party can be revoked and will terminate by operation of law and without notice at the bankruptcy or
temporal demise of the Swedish party giving such powers.

The principal rule is that foreign judgments are neither recognized nor enforced in Sweden, unless
such judgments pertain to a civil or commercial matter (but not for example bankruptcy) rendered by
a court of another Member State of the EU or EFTA (Economic Free Trade Association), or judgments
rendered by a court of another Nordic country.

The United States and Sweden do not currently have a convention or treaty providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of court judgments, other than arbitral awards, in civil and commercial
matters. Therefore, a final judgment for payment of money rendered by a federal or state court in the
United States in civil and commercial matters, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or
state securities laws, would not be directly enforceable, either in whole or in part, in Sweden.

In order to enforce any such judgment in Sweden, proceedings must therefore be initiated by way of
civil law action on the judgment debt before a court of competent jurisdiction in Sweden, or an
administrative tribunal or executive or other public authority of Sweden. Enforcement of any such
judgments in Sweden, would not be recognized or enforceable in Sweden as a matter of right without
a retrial on its merits (but will be persuasive authority as a matter of evidence before the courts of law,
administrative tribunals or executive or other public authorities of Sweden). However, there is Swedish
case law to indicate that such judgments:

(a) that are based on contract which expressly exclude the jurisdiction of the courts of Sweden;

(b) that were rendered under observance of due process of law;

(c) against which there lies no further right to appeal; and

(d) the recognition of which would not manifestly contravene fundamental principles of the legal
order or the public policy of Sweden,

should be acknowledged without retrial on its merits.


-----

Any legal proceedings in the courts of Sweden will be conducted in Swedish and a court or
enforcement authority in Sweden may require, as a further condition for admissibility and/or
enforceability the translation into Swedish of any relevant document, and assistance from Swedish
authorities in the service of process in connection with foreign proceedings might require the
observance of certain procedural and other regulations.

Pursuant to the provisions of the Council Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament
and of the Council of 12 December 2012, on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of
judgments in civil and commercial matters (the “2012 Brussels I Regulation”), a judgment entered
against a company in the courts of a Member State (as defined therein, i.e. all Member States of the
European Union) and which is enforceable in such a Member State, will be directly enforceable in
Sweden upon the satisfaction of the formal requirements of the 2012 Brussels I Regulation without any
declaration of enforceability being required. It should be noted, however, that a party may apply for
refusal of recognition or refusal of enforcement, as applicable, in accordance with the 2012 Brussels I
Regulation. Such an application shall be submitted to the relevant district court (Sw. _tingsrätt) in_
Sweden.

With regard to the provisions of the 2007 Lugano Convention on the Recognition of Judgments in Civil
and Commercial Matters (the “Lugano Convention”), a judgment entered against a company in the
courts of a Contracting State (as defined in therein, i.e. all Member States of the European Union and
the European Free Trade Association countries other than Liechtenstein (namely Iceland, Switzerland
and Norway) and which is enforceable in such Contracting State, will be directly enforceable in
Sweden only upon the satisfaction of the following requirements: (a) that a motion for enforcement has
been filed with the relevant district court (Sw. tingsrätt) in Sweden as provided by law and has been
granted; (b) that no appeals lie against the judgment entered in the courts of such Contracting State;
(c) that the courts of such Contracting State had jurisdiction; (d) that summons has been duly served
on the respondent in the proceedings before the courts of such Contracting State; (e) that the
judgment is not inconsistent with a prior judgment given between the same parties in the same matter;
and (f) that the judgment does not contravene fundamental principles of the legal order or the public
policy of Sweden.

Judgments which are not within the scope of the Brussels I Regulation or Brussels I Regulation Recast
(as applicable) or Lugano Convention would, with very limited exceptions, not be recognized or
enforced in Sweden without a retrial on the merits. This would for example apply to judgments from
United States and other non-EU/EFTA countries.

Swedish courts may award judgments or give awards in currencies other than the local currency, but
the judgment debtor has the right under the laws of Sweden to pay the judgment debt (even though
denominated in a foreign currency) in the local currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date
of payment (however, the judgment creditor may, subject to availability of the foreign currency, convert
such local currency into the foreign currency after payment and remove such foreign currency from
Sweden), and a choice of currency provisions by the parties to an agreement may not be upheld by
Swedish courts to constitute a right to refuse payment in Swedish kronor.

**Audit Report**

**_To the Annual General Meeting of Intrum Justitia AB (publ), corporate identity number_**
**_556607-7581_**

**Report on the annual and consolidated accounts**
**Opinions**
We have conducted an audit of the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts of Intrum Justitia
AB (publ) for the year 2016. The company’s annual and consolidated accounts are presented on
pages •–• of this document.

In our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act
and present, in all material respects, a fair portrayal of the financial position of the Parent Company as
of December 31, 2016 and its financial performance and cash flow for the year in accordance with the
Annual Accounts Act. The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual
Accounts Act and give, in all material respects, a fair portrayal of the financial position of the Group as
of December 31, 2016 and its financial performance and cash flow for the year in accordance with the
International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS), as adopted by the EU, and the Annual Accounts Act.

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion set out below.

We therefore recommend that the Annual General Meeting approve the consolidated Income Statement
and Balance Sheet and the Income Statement and Balance Sheet of the Parent Company.

**Basis for opinion**
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and generally
accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibility in accordance with these standards is
described in the section Auditor’s responsibility. We are independent of the Parent Company and the
Group in accordance with generally accepted auditing practices in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled
our professional ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have gathered is sufficient and appropriate as a basis for our
opinions.

**Particularly important areas**
Particularly important areas are those which, in our professional judgment, were the most significant for
the audit of the annual and consolidated accounts for the current period. These areas were addressed
within the framework of the audit of, and in our stance on the annual accounts and the consolidated
accounts as a whole, although we express no separate opinions regarding those areas.

**_Income recognition_**
Consolidated net revenues for 2016 amounted to SEK 6,088 M. As is evident from Note 2 and 3 to the
annual accounts, net revenues are distributed between the various revenue sources, including
collection fees, commissions and fees, as well as amounts collected on purchased receivables less
amortization. The number of transactions in the various flows is extensive, which places high demands
on the company’s internal controls and administrative processes. We have therefore assessed revenue
recognition and the related IT systems as a particularly important area in the audit.

In our audit, we examined principles for revenue recognition, processes for significant revenue streams
and related IT systems. We have, among other things, tested the company’s controls, performed an
analytical review using data-based analysis tools and evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s
controls for IT systems of relevance for income recognition. On a random basis, we have also examined
income against agreements and amounts paid in. Processes for program development, program
changes and access management have been reviewed, as has the monitoring and handling of
incidents. We have also examined the appropriateness of the disclosures made in the notes.


-----

**_Goodwill_**
Goodwill is reported at SEK 3,120 M in the consolidated balance sheet as per December 31, 2016. The
company tests, at least annually and when there is an indication of impairment, that the carrying values
do not exceed the assets’ recoverable amounts. The recoverable amounts are determined by
calculating the value in use of each cash generating unit, in connection with which estimated future
cash flows are discounted. The company’s cash flow forecasts are based on historical experience,
business plans and other forward-looking assessments. The impairment test for 2016 did not result in
any impairment. A description of the accounting principles for goodwill is presented in Note 1 and the
impairment testing, as well as critical estimates and assumptions are presented in Notes 10 and 36. As
a consequence of carrying amounts being significant for the financial reporting, and of the evaluations
and significant assumptions required for the calculation of value in use, we have assessed the
accounting for goodwill as a particularly important area of the audit.

We have assessed the company’s process for performing impairment testing. We have examined
valuation methods and calculations, the reasonableness of the assumptions made and sensitivity
analyses for changed assumptions supported by our valuation specialists. Comparisons have been
made with historical results, and other companies in the same sector. The precision of previous
forecasts has been evaluated. We have also assessed whether the disclosures made in the notes were
appropriate.

**_Purchased debt_**
Purchased debt is reported at SEK 8,733 M in the consolidated balance sheet as per December 31,
2016. Reporting follows the effective interest method, where the carrying value of each portfolio
corresponds to the present value of expected future cash flows. The expected cash flows are
discounted at an effective interest rate determined on the acquisition of the respective portfolios.
Current cash flow projections and book values are monitored over the course of the year based on,
among other things, achieved collection results, agreements reached with debtors on installment plans
and macroeconomic information.

Accounting principles for purchased debt are presented in Note 1, critical estimates and assumptions
are presented in Note 36, and a description of the purchased debt is given in Note 14.

The company’s accounting of purchased debt is considered to be a particularly important area in the
audit due to reported amounts being of significance for the financial reporting and the portfolio
valuations require the company to make estimates, assumptions and judgments.

In our audit, we have, among other things, evaluated the company’s processes for valuing purchased
debt, using valuation models and the reasonableness of the assumptions made in the calculation of the
effective interest rate, as well as of the ongoing reviews of book value. We have also examined whether
the disclosures made in the notes were appropriate.

**Information other than the annual and consolidated accounts**
This document also contains information other than the annual and consolidated accounts presented
on pages •–•. The Board of Directors and the President are responsible for this other information in the
Audit Report.

Our opinion on the annual and consolidated accounts does not cover this other information and we do
not express any form of assurance conclusion regarding this other information in the Audit Report.

In connection with our audit of the annual and consolidated accounts, our responsibility is to read the
information identified above and consider whether the information is materially inconsistent with the
annual and consolidated accounts. In this procedure we also take into account our knowledge
otherwise obtained in the audit and assess whether the information otherwise appears to be materially
misstated.

If we, based on the work performed concerning this information, conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in
this regard.


-----

**Responsibilities of the board of directors and the president**
The Board of Directors and the President are responsible for the preparation of the annual and
consolidated accounts and that they give a fair presentation in accordance with the Annual Accounts
Act for Credit Institutions and Securities Companies and, concerning the consolidated accounts,
furthermore in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU. The Board of Directors and the President
are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation
of annual and consolidated accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error.

In preparing the annual and consolidated accounts, the Board of Directors and the President are
responsible for the assessment of the company’s and the Group’s ability to continue operating. They
disclose, as applicable, conditions that could impact the company’s capacity to continue operating, and
the assumption of continued operation. However, the assumption of continued operation is not applied
if the Board of Directors and the President intend to liquidate the company, cease operations, or have
no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Audit Committee shall, without prejudice to the Board of Director’s responsibilities and tasks in
general, among other things oversee the company’s financial reporting process.

**Auditors’ responsibility**
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the annual and consolidated
accounts as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue
an auditor’s report that includes our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but
is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and generally accepted auditing
standards in Sweden will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these annual and
consolidated accounts.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain
professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

-    Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the annual and consolidated accounts,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or
the override of internal control.

-    Obtain an understanding of the company’s internal control relevant to our audit in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control.

-    Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors and the President.

-    Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ and the President’s use of the going
concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual and consolidated accounts. We also draw a
conclusion, based on the audit evidence obtained, as to whether any material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s and the Group’s
ability to continue its operations. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required
to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the annual and consolidated
accounts or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion about the annual and
consolidated accounts. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date
of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause a company and a group
to cease to continue as a going concern.

-    Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the annual and consolidated accounts,
including the disclosures, and whether the annual and consolidated accounts represent the
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.


-----

-    Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities
or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated accounts. We
are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain
solely responsible for our opinions.

We must inform the Board of Directors of, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the
audit. We must also inform of significant audit findings during our audit, including any significant
deficiencies in internal control that we identified.

We must also provide the Board of Directors with a opinion that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related
safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of
most significance in the audit of the annual and consolidated accounts, including the most important
assessed risks for material misstatement, and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these
matters in the auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes disclosure about the matter or when,
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in the
auditor’s report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to
outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

**Report on other Legal and Regulatory Requirements**

**Opinions**
In addition to our audit of the annual and consolidated accounts, we have also audited the
administration of the Board of Directors and the President of Intrum Justitia AB (publ) for 2016 and the
proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss.

We recommend that the Annual General Meeting appropriate the company’s earnings in accordance
with the proposal presented in the statutory administration report (Board of Directors’ Report) and that
the Board members and the President be discharged from liability for the financial year.

**Basis for opinion**
We have conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our
responsibility in accordance with this is described in the section Auditor’s responsibility. We are
independent of the Parent Company and the Group in accordance with generally accepted auditing
practices in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our professional ethical responsibilities in accordance
with these requirements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have gathered is sufficient and appropriate as a basis for our
opinions.

**Responsibility of the board of directors and the president**
The Board of Directors is responsible for the proposal for appropriations of the company’s profit or loss.
At the proposal of a dividend, this includes an assessment of whether the dividend is justifiable
considering the requirements which the company’s and the Group’s type of operations, size and risks
place on the size of the Parent Company’s and the Group’s equity, consolidation requirements, liquidity
and position in general.

The Board of Directors is responsible for the company’s organization and the administration of
the company’s affairs. This includes among other things continuous assessment of the company’s and
the Group’s financial situation and ensuring that the company’s organization is designed so that the
accounting, management of assets and the company’s financial affairs otherwise are controlled in a
reassuring manner. The President shall manage the ongoing administration according to the Board of
Directors’ guidelines and instructions and among other matters take measures that are necessary to
fulfill the company’s accounting in accordance with law and handle the management of assets in a
reassuring manner.


-----

**Auditors’ responsibility**
Our objective concerning the audit of the administration, and thereby our opinion about discharge from
liability, is to obtain audit evidence to assess with a reasonable assurance whether any member of the
Board of Directors or the President in any material respect:

-    has undertaken any action or been guilty of any omission which can give rise to liability to the
company, or

-    in any other way has acted in contravention of the Companies Act, the Banking and Financing
Business Act, the Annual Accounts Act for Credit Institutions and Securities Companies or the
Articles of Association.

Our objective concerning the audit of the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss, and
thereby our opinion about this, is to assess with reasonable assurance whether the proposal is in
accordance with the Companies Act.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect actions or
omissions that can give rise to liability to the company, or that the proposed appropriations of the
company’s profit or loss are not in accordance with the Companies Act.

As part of an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden, we exercise
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. The examination of
the administration and the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss is based primarily on
the audit of the accounts. Additional audit procedures performed are based on our professional
judgment with starting point in risk and materiality. This means that we focus the examination on such
actions, areas and relationships that are material for the operations and where deviations and violations
would have particular importance for the company’s situation. We examine and test decisions
undertaken, support for decisions, actions taken and other circumstances that are relevant to our
opinion concerning discharge from liability. As a basis for our opinion on the Board of Directors’
proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss we examined the Board of Directors’ reasoned
statement and a selection of supporting evidence in order to be able to assess whether the proposal is
in accordance with the Companies Act.

### Notes to the audited consolidated financial statements

**1    Significant accounting and valuation principles**
**General**
The Parent Company Intrum Justitia AB (publ) is a registered company domiciled in Stockholm,
Sweden. The address of the company’s headquarters is Hesselmans Torg 14, Nacka, SE-105 24
Stockholm, Sweden. In 2016, the company was listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm, Large Cap list.

The consolidated accounts were approved for publication by the company’s Board of Directors on
March 30, 2017. The balance sheets and income statements will be presented to the Annual General
Meeting on June 29, 2017.

The Parent Company’s functional currency is Swedish kronor (SEK), which is also the reporting
currency for the Parent Company and for the Group. The financial statements are therefore presented
in SEK. All amounts, unless indicated otherwise, are rounded off to the nearest SEK M.

The consolidated and annual accounts pertain to January 1–December 31 for income statement items
and December 31 for balance sheet items.

**Accounting standards applied**
With regard to the consolidated financial statements, the annual report for Intrum Justitia AB (publ) has
been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and the International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The Group applies
IFRS as adopted by the European Union (EU). For 2016, there are no new provisions relevant to Intrum
Justitia in the IFRS issued by the IASB that have not yet been adopted by the EU. This means that the
Group’s application of IFRS as adopted by the EU during the year also corresponds to the application
of IFRS as issued by the IASB.

Further, recommendation _RFR 1 Supplementary accounting rules for groups from the Swedish_
Financial Reporting Board has been applied.

The Parent Company applies the same accounting principles as the Group except in the cases stated
in the section “Parent Company accounting principles”.

**Assumptions**
Assets and liabilities are recognized at historical cost, with the exception of certain financial assets and
liabilities, which are measured at fair value.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the Board of Directors and
Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the accounting principles
and the carrying values of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Estimates and assumptions are
based on historical experience and a number of other factors that under current circumstances seem
reasonable. The result of these estimates and assumptions is then used to determine the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that otherwise are not clearly indicated by other sources. Actual
outcomes may deviate from these estimates and assumptions.

Estimates and assumptions are reviewed regularly. Changes in estimates are recognized in the period
in which the change is made, provided it has affected only this period, or the period the change was
made and future periods if the change affects both current and future periods.

Estimates made by the company that have a significant impact on the financial statements and
estimates, which could necessitate significant adjustments in financial statements in subsequent years,
are described in more detail in Note 36.

The accounting principles described below for the Group have been applied consistently for all periods
in the Group’s financial statements, unless otherwise indicated. The Group’s accounting principles have
been applied consistently in the consolidation of the Parent Company, subsidiaries, associated
companies and joint ventures.


-----

**Changes in accounting principles**
_Changes that entered into force in 2016_
There are a number of minor changes and clarifications to IFRS with effect from 1 January 2016,
although none of these has had any significant impact on the Intrum Justitia Group’s accounting.

Effective from the 2016 Annual Report, the Parent Company applies the version of RFR 2 Accounting
for Legal Entities, updated in January 2017, which contains a clarification of how the exchange
differences on monetary items classified as extended net investment in a foreign subsidiary should be
classified. See below under the Parent Company’s accounting principles.

_Changes that enter into force in or after 2017_
The Group has decided against early application of any new or amended accounting recommendations
or interpretations that enter into force in or after 2017.

No significant changes in IFRS have been introduced effective from 2017.

_IFRS 9 Financial Instruments_ is, effective from 2018, to replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments:
_Recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 entails changes in the way financial assets are classified and_
valued, and introduces an impairment model based on expected rather than incurred losses, as well as
changes to the principles for hedge accounting.

An assessment of the impact on the Group’s accounting of the application of IFRS 9 is in progress.
It has not yet been possible to estimate the effects in terms of amounts, and these will be calculated as
each implementation project progresses during 2017. The following description is based on information
currently known or estimated. The choice of transitional methods will be made when the analysis of
IFRS 9 has reached a phase providing a more complete foundation than at present.

It is Intrum Justitia’s assessment that purchased debt should, under IFRS 9 continue to be carried at
amortized cost, as in IAS 39, by applying an adjusted effective interest rate reflecting anticipated actual
cash flows. One difference from IAS 39 is that IFRS 9 expressly provides that a positive effect can arise
if the forecast for anticipated cash flows increases, even in the event that the current forecast exceeds
the initial forecast made on the acquisition of the portfolio.

The new rules for impairment also mean that a provision for expected losses on accounts receivable
should generally be made somewhat earlier. As indicated in Note 16, the Group has reserved SEK 3 M
for losses on accounts receivable in 2016 and SEK 11 M in 2015. Had IFRS 9 been applied, it is likely
that a provision for about the same amount would have had to be made a year earlier. A more detailed
assessment in terms of amounts has yet to be made.

Intrum Justitia does not intend to adopt IFRS 9 prematurely in 2017.

Effective from 2018, IFRS 15 Revenue from customer contracts is to replace IAS 18 Revenue. IFRS 15
is based on revenue being recognized when control of the good or service is transferred to the
customer, which differs from the current basis in the transfer of risks and rewards. IFRS 15 introduces
new ways of determining how and when revenue should be recognized, entailing a new approach
compared with how revenue is currently reported. The sectors most affected are the construction and
civil engineering sectors, as well as companies engaged in contract manufacturing. However, all
companies will be affected by the new expanded disclosure requirements.

Intrum Justitia’s principal revenue from customer contracts, derives from collection services. Revenue
is generally recognized when the service has been completed successfully, that is, when the Group’s
customer has received payment for its claim. Intrum Justitia’s assessment is currently that IFRS 15
does not cause any significant change in how revenues from collection services are to be reported.

Intrum Justitia does not intend to adopt IFRS 15 prematurely in 2017.

Effective from 2019, _IFRS 16 Leases_ is to replace IAS 17 Leases. IFRS 16 provides that leases
currently accounted for as operating leases should generally start to be reported in a manner similar to
the current accounting for financial leases. This requires assets and liabilities also being reported for
operating leases, with associated reporting of costs for depreciation and interest, unlike today when no
accounting is performed for the leased asset and related liability, and with lease payments being
amortized on a straight-line basis as a lease expense.


-----

The main effect on Intrum Justitia’s accounting is expected to be the Group’s total assets will increase
through an asset and a liability being recognized in respect of the leases in effect at any given time.
A rough estimate, based on the 2015 figures, is that total assets during the year would have increased
by about 5 percent. Another effect is that the implicit interest expense in lease agreements is recognized
in financial expense and not in operating profit, which in 2015 would have entailed an improvement in
operating income in the order of 1 percent.

Intrum Justitia does not intend to adopt IFRS 16 prematurely in 2017.

Other changes to IFRS are not expected to have any material effect on the consolidated accounts.

**Classification issues**
Fixed assets and long-term liabilities in the Parent Company and the Group consist of amounts that are
expected to be recovered or paid more than twelve months after the balance sheet date. Current assets
and current liabilities in the Parent Company and the Group consist of amounts that are expected to be
recovered or paid within twelve months of the balance sheet date.

**Consolidation**
_Subsidiaries_
The Group applies IFRS 3 Business combinations and IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements.

The consolidated accounts include the annual accounts of all subsidiaries, i.e., companies in which the
Parent Company, directly or indirectly, holds more than 50 percent of the votes or otherwise can
exercise control over operations. A controlling interest is achieved when the Group is exposed to, or has
rights to variable returns from, its commitment to the company and is able to affect returns by means
of its decisive influence. An influence arises when the Group has existing rights enabling it to control
the relevant operations, that is, the operations that significantly affect the company’s performance.

The consolidated accounts are prepared according to the acquisition method, which means that the
acquisition of a subsidiary is treated as a transaction where the Group indirectly acquires the
subsidiary’s assets and takes over its liabilities and contingent liabilities. The Group’s equity therefore
includes only the portion of the subsidiary’s equity added since acquisition. The Group’s cost is
determined through an acquisition analysis in connection with the acquisition. The analysis determines
the cost of the shares or operations as well as the fair value of acquired, identifiable assets and
assumed liabilities and contingent liabilities. The cost of the subsidiary’s shares or operations consists
of the fair value of the compensation on the transfer date and transaction expenses directly attributable
to the acquisition. The cost includes conditional purchase considerations recognized as liabilities at fair
value per the acquisition date. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.

In acquisitions where the cost exceeds the net value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities and
contingent liabilities, the difference is reported as goodwill. When the difference is negative, it is
recognized directly in the income statement.

Non-controlling interests arise in cases where the acquisition does not relate to the entire subsidiary.
There are two options for recognizing non-controlling interests. The two options are to recognize the
percentage of non-controlling interests that makes up proportional net assets, or to recognize
non-controlling interests at fair value, which means that non-controlling interests form a percentage of
goodwill. The method used for recognizing non-controlling interests is made on a case by case basis.

The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated accounts from the acquisition
date until control ceases.

Intra-Group receivables and liabilities, income and expenses, and unrealized gains and losses that
arise from transactions within the Group are eliminated in their entirety in the consolidated accounts.

Unrealized gains arising from transactions with associated companies and joint ventures are eliminated
to a degree corresponding to the Group’s ownership of those companies. Unrealized losses are
eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, to the extent there is an indication of impairment.


-----

_Associated companies and joint ventures_
The Group applies IAS 28 Investments in associates and joint ventures.

Associated companies are companies that are not subsidiaries but where the Parent Company, directly
or indirectly, has at least 20 percent of the votes or otherwise exercises significant influence without
having control over the partly owned company.

Participations in associated companies and joint ventures are recognized in the consolidated accounts
according to the equity method, which means that the holding in the company is recognized at cost and
subsequently adjusted to the Group’s share of the change in the associated company’s net assets. The
value of the shares includes goodwill from the acquisition. The consolidated income statement includes
the Group’s participation in the company’s earnings less goodwill impairment. The amount is reported
under Participations in the earnings of associates and joint ventures. Dividends received from the
company are not recognized in the income statement and instead reduce the carrying value of the
investment.

Any difference between the cost of an acquisition and the owner’s share of the net fair value of the
associated company’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognized in
accordance with IFRS 3.

The equity method is applied from the date a significant influence arises until the time it ceases or the
associated company becomes a subsidiary.

If the Group’s share of reported losses in the company exceeds the carrying value of its participations,
the value of those participations is reduced to nil. Losses can also be offset against the Group’s
unsecured receivables from the company if they constitute part of the net investment. Further losses
are not recognized provided the Group has not issued guarantees to cover them.

_Joint ventures_
The Group applies IFRS 11 Joint arrangements.

Joint arrangements pertain to companies in which Intrum Justitia and other part-owners manage
operations jointly in accordance with a shareholder agreement. The Group has only been engaged in
joint arrangements classified as joint ventures, and these are reported in the consolidated financial
statements according to the equity method. This means that participations in jointly owned companies
are recognized at cost and subsequently adjusted for the Group’s share of the change in the company’s
net assets. The consolidated income statement includes the Group’s share of earnings, and this is
reported under Participations in the earnings of associates and joint ventures. Dividends received from
joint ventures are not recognized in the income statement and instead reduce the carrying value of the
investment.

The equity method is applied from the date on which joint control is gained until the date that it ceases
or transitions to the sole influence of Intrum Justitia.

**Foreign currency**
The Group applies IAS 21 Effects of changes in foreign exchange rates.

_Transactions in foreign currency_
Group companies prepare their accounts in the local functional currency in the country where they have
their operations. Transactions in a currency other than the local currency are recognized at the
exchange rate in effect on the transaction day. When such transactions are offset or settled, the
exchange rate may deviate from the one that applied on the transaction day, in which case a (realized)
exchange rate difference arises. Moreover, monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are
translated at the exchange rates on each balance sheet date, due to which an (unrealized) exchange
rate difference arises. Both realized and unrealized exchange rate differences of this type are
recognized in the income statement – in the operating result if, for example, they refer to accounts
receivable or accounts payable, or in net financial items if they refer to financial investments and
borrowing in foreign currency.


-----

To avoid exchange rate differences, receivables and liabilities in foreign currency are sometimes
hedged through forward exchange contracts. The Group’s holding of forward exchange contracts is
marked to market on each balance sheet date, and changes in value are recognized in the income
statement.

_Translation of the financial statements of foreign operations_
Assets and liabilities in foreign operations, including goodwill and other Group surplus and deficit
values, are translated from the functional currency to the Group’s reporting currency, Swedish kronor,
at the exchange rate on balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated at the average rate,
which serves as an approximation of the rate that applied on each transaction date. Translation
differences arise in the translation of subsidiary accounts in part because the balance sheet date rate
changes each period and in part because the average rate deviates from balance sheet date rate.
Translation differences are recognized directly in total comprehensive income as the year’s change in
the translation reserve.

Long-term receivables and liabilities between the Parent Company and subsidiaries can be seen as an
extension or reduction of the net investment in each company. Such translation differences are
therefore recognized in the consolidated financial statements in total comprehensive income.

When foreign operations are sold, accumulated translation differences attributable to those operations
are realized.

During the year the Group did not hedge any other flow exposure pertaining to anticipated receipts or
disbursements in foreign currency.

**Financial assets and liabilities**
The Group applies _IAS 32 Financial Instruments:_ Presentation, IAS 39 Financial Instruments:
_Recognition and Measurement, IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and IFRS 13 Fair Value_
_Measurement._

A financial instrument is defined as any form of agreement giving rise to a financial asset in a company
and a financial liability or equity instrument in a counterparty.

Financial instruments recognized in the balance sheet include, on the asset side, cash and bank
balances, accounts receivable and other equity instruments, loans receivable, purchased debt and
derivatives. Client funds are recognized on a separate line in the balance sheet and therefore are not
included in the Group’s reported liquid assets. Included among liabilities and equity are accounts
payable, client funds payable, debt and equity instruments in issue, loan liabilities and derivatives.

Financial instruments are initially recognized at cost, corresponding to the instrument’s fair value plus
transaction expenses. Exceptions are financial instruments categorized as financial assets or liabilities
recognized at fair value in income statement, which are recognized at fair value excluding transaction
costs. Measurement depends on how they are classified, as indicated below.

A financial asset or financial liability is recognized in the balance sheet when the company becomes
party to the instrument’s contractual terms. Receivables are recognized when the company has
performed and there is a contractual obligation on the counterparty to pay, even if an invoice has not
yet been sent. Accounts receivable are recognized in the balance sheet when an invoice has been sent.
Liabilities are recognized when the counterparty has performed and there is a contractual obligation to
pay, even if an invoice has not yet been received. Trade accounts payable are recognized when an
invoice is received.

A financial asset is removed from the balance sheet when the rights in the agreement are realized,
expire or the company loses control over them. A financial liability is removed from the balance sheet
when the obligation in the agreement has been discharged or otherwise extinguished.

The fair value of listed financial assets corresponds to their listed market price on the balance sheet
date. The fair value of unlisted financial assets is determined by using valuation techniques, e.g.,
recently conducted transactions, the price of similar instruments and discounted cash flows. For forward
exchange contracts and currency interest rate swaps, fair value is determined based on listed prices.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts and currency interest rate swaps is calculated by


-----

discounting the difference between the contracted forward rate and the forward rate that can be secured
on the balance sheet date for the remaining contract period. The current value is obtained by
discounting applying the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. For further information, see Note 34.

_Purchased debt_
Purchased debt consists of portfolios of delinquent consumer debts purchased at prices significantly
below the nominal receivable. They are recognized according to the rules for loans and receivables in
IAS 39, i.e., at amortized cost according to the effective interest model.

Income from purchased debt is recognized in the income statement as the collected amount less
amortization. The collection is often performed by the same personnel who handle collections and debt
surveillance on behalf of external clients within the Credit Management service line. The cost of
collection is debited internally at market price and expensed in the income statement for the Purchased
Debt service line as a cost of services sold.

Reporting follows the effective interest method, where the carrying value of each portfolio corresponds
to the present value of all projected future cash flows discounted by an initial effective interest rate
determined on the date the portfolio was acquired, based on the relation between cost and the
projected future cash flows on the acquisition date. Changes in the carrying value of the portfolios are
comprised of amortization for the period and are recognized in the income statement on the revenue
line.

In connection with the purchase of each portfolio of receivables, a projection is made of the portfolio’s
cash flows. Cash flows include the loan amount, reminder fees, collection fees and late interest that,
based on a probability assessment, are expected to be received from debtors, less forecast collection
costs. With this forecast and the purchase price including transaction costs as a basis, each portfolio is
assigned an initial effective interest rate that is then used to discount cash flows through the life of the
portfolio. Current cash flow projections are monitored over the course of the year and updated based
on, among other things, achieved collection results, agreements reached with debtors on installment
plans and macroeconomic information. Cash flow projections are made at the portfolio level, since each
portfolio of receivables consists of a small number of homogeneous amounts. On the basis of the
updated cash flow projections and initial effective interest rate, a new carrying value for the portfolio is
calculated in the closing accounts.

The Group applies internal application rules which mean that the initial effective interest rate can be
adjusted in certain cases without a change in the carrying value of the portfolio for minor projection
adjustments within a predetermined interval.

Changes over time in the book value can be divided into a time and interest rate component and a
component related to changes in estimates of future cash flows. The effects of changes in cash flow
forecasts are referred to as revaluations and treated symmetrically, i.e., both increases and decreases
in forecast flows affect the portfolios’ book value and, as a result, earnings. However, the portfolios are
never recognized at higher than cost.

Although selling portfolios of purchased debt is not included in the business model, when such sales do
occur as an exception, the resulting sales price received for the portfolio is reported in the same way
as if it had been collected from the debtors. The entire remaining carrying values of the portfolios are
recognized as amortization.

_Long-term receivables and other receivables_
Long-term receivables and other receivables are those that arise when the company provides money
without the intent to trade its claim. If the anticipated maturity is longer than one year they constitute
long-term receivables, and if it is shorter they are other receivables. These receivables fall into the
category Loans and accounts receivable and are assessed at their discounted current value if their
expected maturity exceeds 12 months. If their maturities are shorter, they are assessed at accrued cost.

_Accounts receivable_
Accounts receivable are classified in the category loans and receivables. Accounts receivable are
recognized at the amount expected to be received after deducting impaired receivables, which are
determined individually or according to statistical models based on historical experience in each


-----

country. Impairment needs are addressed when receivables have fallen overdue for payment by a
certain number of days, which differs between countries, or if Intrum Justitia becomes aware that the
counterparty has become insolvent. Provisions for impaired receivables are recognized as sales and
marketing expenses. The anticipated maturity of accounts receivable is short, so they are carried at
accrued cost without discounting.

_Legal outlays_
The Group incurs outlays for court fees, legal representation, enforcement authorities, etc., which can
be charged to and collected from debtors. In certain cases Intrum Justitia has agreements with its
clients where any expenses that cannot be collected from debtors are instead refunded by the client.
The amount that is expected to be recovered from a solvent counterparty is recognized as an asset in
the balance sheet on the line Other receivables. The anticipated maturity of these receivable is short,
so they are carried at accrued cost without discounting.

_Client funds_
Client funds, which are reported as assets and liabilities in the balance sheet, represent cash received
on collection of a specific debt on behalf of a client and payable to the client within a specified period.
Client funds are liquid funds with a restricted disposition right. The same amount is reported as a
liability.

_Liquid assets_
Liquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents as well as immediately available balances with
banks and similar institutions. Short-term investments consist of investments with an insignificant risk
of fluctuating in value, which can easily be converted to cash and have a maturity of not more than three
months from acquisition.

_Liabilities_
Liabilities are classified as other financial liabilities, which means that they are initially recognized at the
amount received after deducting transaction expenses. Subsequent to recognition, loans are carried at
amortized cost according to the effective rate method. Long-term liabilities have an anticipated maturity
of more than one year, while short-term liabilities have a maturity of less than one year. The Group’s
long-term loans generally have short fixed-interest periods, which means that the nominal loan amount
plus accrued interest is a good approximation of the liability calculated according to the effective rate
model.

_Accounts payable_
Accounts payable are classified in the category other financial liabilities. Accounts payable have a short
anticipated maturity and are carried without discounting at nominal amount.

_Derivatives_
Derivatives consist of forward exchange contracts, interest swaps and currency interest rate swaps
used to reduce interest and exchange rate risks attributable to assets and liabilities in foreign currency.
Derivatives are also contractual terms embedded in other agreements. Embedded derivatives are
recognized separately if they are not closely related to the host agreement.

Forward exchange contracts are classified as financial assets or liabilities recognized at fair value
through profit or loss (held for trade) and assessed at fair value without deductions for transaction
expenses that may arise on sale or similar.

Hedge accounting is not needed for forward exchange contracts because the hedged item and the
hedging instrument are carried at fair value with changes in value recognized in the income statement
as exchange rate differences. Changes in the value of operations-related receivables and liabilities are
recognized in operating earnings, while changes in the value of financial receivables and liabilities are
recognized in net financial items.

Currency interest rate swaps are valued at fair value and reported in the balance sheet together with
hedge accounting via Other comprehensive income. Currency interest rate swaps were signed in
connection with the Parent Company’s issue of bonds in SEK that were exchanged for EUR to hedge


-----

net investments in foreign operations where the loan currency has been used in the operations. The
liability in SEK was exchanged into the same liability in EUR on both the starting date and the date of
maturity.

_Hedge accounting with regard to exchange rate risk in the net investment in foreign subsidiaries_
Investments in foreign subsidiaries (net assets including goodwill) are to some extent hedged through
loans in foreign currency or forward exchange contracts that are translated on the closing date to the
exchange rate then in effect. Translation differences for the period on financial instruments used to
hedge a net investment in a Group company are recognized in the degree the hedge is effective in total
comprehensive income, while cumulative changes are recognized in equity (translation reserve). As a
result, translation differences that arise when Group companies are consolidated are neutralized.

**Intangible fixed assets**
_Goodwill_
Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of an acquisition and the fair value of the acquired
assets, assumed liabilities and contingent liabilities.

If the Group’s cost of the acquired shares in a subsidiary exceeds the market value of the subsidiary’s
net assets according to the acquisition analysis, the difference is recognized as Group goodwill. The
goodwill that can arise through business combinations implemented through other than a purchase of
shares is recognized in the same way.

For business combinations where the cost is less than the net value of acquired assets and assumed
and contingent liabilities, the difference is recognized directly through the income statement.

Goodwill is recognized at cost less accumulated impairment. The fair value of goodwill is determined
annually for each cash-generating unit in relation to the unit’s performance and anticipated future cash
flow. If deemed necessary, goodwill is written down on the basis of this evaluation. Intrum Justitia’s
operations in each geographical region (Northern Europe, Central Europe and Western Europe) are
considered the Group’s cash-generating units in this regard.

Goodwill that arises from the acquisition of a company outside Sweden is classified as an asset in the
local currency and translated in the accounts at the balance sheet date rate.

_Capitalized expenditure for IT development_
The Group applies IAS 38 Intangible assets.

Expenditures for IT development and maintenance are generally expensed as incurred. Expenditures
for software development that can be attributed to identifiable assets under the Group’s control and with
anticipated future economic benefits are capitalized and recognized as intangible assets. These
capitalized costs include staff costs for the development team and other direct and indirect costs.
Borrowing costs are included in the cost of qualified fixed assets.

Additional expenditures for previously developed software, etc. are recognized as an asset in the
balance sheet if they increase the future economic benefits of the specific asset to which they are
attributable, e.g., by improving or extending a computer program’s functionality beyond its original use
and estimated useful life.

IT development costs that are recognized as intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line
method over their useful lives (3–5 years). Useful life is reassessed annually. The asset is recognized
at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment.

Costs associated with the maintenance of existing computer software are expensed as incurred.

_Client relationships_
Client relationships that are recognized as fixed assets relate to fair value revaluations recognized upon
acquisition in accordance with IFRS 3. They are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated
period of use (5–10 years). Useful life is reassessed annually. The asset is recognized at cost less
accumulated amortization and impairment.


-----

_Other intangible fixed assets_
Other intangible fixed assets relate to other acquired rights and are amortized on a straight-line basis
over their estimated period of use (3–5 years). Useful life is reassessed annually. The asset is
recognized at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment.

**Tangible fixed assets**
The Group applies IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment.

Tangible fixed assets are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Cost
includes the purchase price and costs directly attributable to putting the asset into place and condition
to be utilized in the way intended. Examples of directly attributable costs are delivery and handling,
installation, consulting services and legal services. Depreciation is booked on a straight-line basis over
the asset’s anticipated useful life (3–5 years). Useful life is reassessed annually.

The carrying value of a tangible fixed asset is excluded from the balance sheet when the asset is sold
or disposed of or when no economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal of the asset. The
gain or loss that arises on the sale or disposal of an asset is comprised of the difference between the
sales price and the asset’s carrying value less direct costs to sell. Gains and losses are recognized as
other operating earnings.

An annual determination is made of each asset’s residual value and a period of use.

Tangible fixed assets are recognized as an asset in the balance sheet if it is likely that the future
economic benefits will flow to the company and the cost of the asset can be reliably measured.

**Leasing**
The Group applies IAS 17 Leases. Leasing is classified in the consolidated accounts as either finance
or operating leasing.

When a lease means that the Group, as lessee, essentially enjoys the economic benefits and bears the
economic risks attributable to the leased asset, it is classified as a finance lease. The leased asset is
recognized in the balance sheet as a fixed asset, while the estimated present value of future lease
payments is recognized as a liability. The portion of the lease fee that falls due for payment within one
year is recognized as a current liability, while the remainder is recognized as a long-term liability.
Minimum lease fees for finance leases are divided between interest expense and amortization of the
outstanding liability. Interest expense is divided over the lease term so that each reporting period is
charged with an amount corresponding to a fixed interest rate for the liability recognized in each period.
Variable fees are expensed in the period in which they arise.

In operating leasing, lease payments are expensed over the lease term. Payments are recognized in
the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Benefits received in connection with
the signing of an operating lease are recognized as part of the total lease expense in the income
statement.

**Taxes**
The Group applies IAS 12 Income taxes.

Income taxes consist of current tax and deferred tax. Income taxes are recognized in the income
statement unless the underlying transaction is recognized directly in other total comprehensive income,
in which case the related tax effect is recognized in other total comprehensive income.

Current tax is tax that is to be paid or received during the year in question applying the tax rates
applicable on the balance sheet date; which includes adjustment of current tax attributable to previous
periods.

Deferred tax is calculated according to the balance sheet method based on temporary differences
between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their value for tax purposes. The following
temporary differences are not taken into account: temporary differences that arise in the initial reporting
of goodwill, the initial reporting of assets and liabilities in a transaction other than a business
combination and which, at the time of the transaction, do not affect either the recognized or taxable


-----

result, or temporary differences attributable to participations in subsidiaries and associated companies
that are not expected to be reversed within the foreseeable future. The valuation of deferred tax is
based on how the carrying values of assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. Deferred
tax is calculated by applying the tax rates and tax rules that have been set or essentially are set as of
the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax assets from deductible temporary differences and taxloss carryforwards are only
recognized if it is likely they will be utilized within the foreseeable future. The value of deferred tax
assets is reduced when it is no longer considered likely they can be utilized.

**Shareholders’ equity**
Share repurchases and transaction expenses are recognized directly against equity. Dividends are
recognized as a liability after they are approved by the Annual General Meeting.

**Provisions**
The Group applies IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.

A provision is recognized in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or informal obligation owing
to an event that has occurred and it is likely that an outflow of economic resources will be required to
settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. The carrying amount for the
provision is based on an assessment of the most likely outcome, and can be calculated by weighing the
various possible outcomes and multiplying this by their estimated probability. Where it is important when
in time payment will be made, provisions are estimated by discounting the projected future cash flow at
a pretax interest rate that reflects current market estimates of the time value of money and, where
appropriate, the risks associated with the liability.

A provision for restructuring is recognized when a detailed, formal restructuring plan has been
established and the restructuring has either begun or been publicly announced. No provision is made
for future operating expenses.

A provision for termination costs is recognized only if the persons in question have known or presumed
to have expected to be terminated by the balance sheet date.

A provision is recognized for a loss-making contract when anticipated benefits that the Group expects
to receive from a contract are less than the unavoidable costs to fulfill the obligations as set out in the
contract.

A provision for dilapidation agreements on leased premises is recognized if there is a contractual
obligation to the landlord, within the foreseeable future, to restore the premises to a certain condition
when the lease expires.

**Unidentified receipts and excess payments**
The Group receives large volumes of payments from debtors for itself and its clients. There are
instances where the sender’s reference information is missing or incorrect, which makes it difficult to
allocate the payment to the right case. There are also situations where payments are received on
closed cases. In such instances a reasonable search and attempt is made to contact the payment
sender but, failing this, the payment is recognized as income after a certain interval. A provision is
recognized in the balance sheet corresponding to the anticipated repayments of incorrectly received
payments on a probability analysis.

**Contingent liabilities**
A contingent liability is recognized when there is a possible obligation that arises from past events
whose existence will be confirmed only by one or more uncertain future events or when there is an
obligation that is not recognized as a liability or provision because it is not probable that an outflow of
resources will be required.


-----

**Impairment**
The Group applies IAS 36 Impairment of assets.

The carrying value of the Group’s assets, with certain exceptions, is tested on each balance sheet date
for any indication of impairment. IAS 36 is applied to impairment testing of all assets with the exception
of financial assets, which are valued according to IAS 39, investment assets for pension liabilities, which
are valued according to _IAS 19 Employee Benefits,_ and tax assets, which are valued according to
_IAS 12 Income Taxes._

If there is any indication of impairment, the asset’s recoverable value is estimated. For goodwill and
other intangible assets with an indeterminate useful life and intangible assets not yet brought into use,
recoverable values are calculated annually. If essentially independent cash flows cannot be isolated for
individual assets, the assets are grouped at the lowest level where essentially independent cash flows
can be identified, i.e., a cash-generating unit. Intrum Justitia’s operations in each geographical region
are considered to be the Group’s cash-generating units in this regard.

Impairment is recognized when the carrying value of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its
recoverable value. Impairment is recognized in the income statement. Impairment attributable to a
cash-generating unit is mainly allocated to goodwill, after which they are divided proportionately among
other assets in the unit.

The recoverable amount of cash-generating units is the higher of their fair value less costs to sell and
value in use. Value in use is measured by discounting future cash flows using a discounting factor that
takes into account the risk-free rate of interest and the risk associated with the specific asset.

Impairment of goodwill is not reversed. Impairment of other assets is reversed if a change has been
made in the assumptions that served as the basis for determining the recoverable amount. Impairment
is reversed only to the extent the carrying value of the assets following the reversal does not exceed
the carrying value that the asset would have had if the impairment had not been recognized.

**Employee benefits**
The Group applies IAS 19 Employee Benefits.

_Pension obligations_
The Group’s pension obligations are, for the most part, secured through official pension arrangements
or insurance solutions. Pension obligations vary between countries on the basis of legislation and
different pension systems. See also Note 21 for a further description.

Defined contribution pension plans are plans where the company’s obligation is limited to the fees it has
committed to pay. The size of the employee’s pension depends in part on the fees the company pays
to an insurance company and in part on the return generated and actuarial factors. Consequently, it is
the employee who assumes the investment risk and actuarial risk. The company’s obligations for
defined contribution pension plans are expensed through the income statement as they are vested by
employees who render services on behalf of the company.

For defined benefit pension plans, the pension obligation does not cease until the agreed pensions
have been paid. The Group’s net obligation for defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately
for each plan by estimating future compensation the employees has earned in current and previous
periods; this compensation is discounted to its present value. The discount rate is the interest rate as
per the balance sheet date on high-quality corporate bonds, including covered bonds, with a maturity
that, if possible, corresponds to the Group’s pension obligations. The calculation is performed by an
actuary using the so-called Projected Unit Credit Method. The fair value of Intrum Justitia’s share of any
investment assets as of the balance sheet date is calculated as well.

Actuarial gains and losses may arise in the determination of the present value of the obligation and the
fair value of investment assets. They arise either because the actual outcome deviates from previous
assumptions or the assumptions change. All changes in value associated with such changes in
assumptions are recognized in other comprehensive income.

The balance sheet value of pensions and similar obligations is therefore equivalent to the present value
on the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets.


-----

Pension costs for service in the current period are reported in the operating result, while the calculated
interest expense on the pension liability and the interest income from assets under management are
reported in net financial items.

Pension obligations in Sweden that are met through pension insurance premiums to Alecta in the
so-called ITP 2 plan are reported as defined contribution pension solutions.

**Borrowing costs**
The Group applies _IAS 23 Borrowing Costs_ and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and
_Measurement._

Costs to secure bank financing are amortized across the term of the loan as financial expenses in the
consolidated income statement. The amount is recognized in the balance sheet as a deduction to the
loan liability.

The Group capitalizes borrowing costs in the cost of qualifying assets, that is, fixed assets for
substantial amounts with long periods of completion. No such investments were initiated in 2015 or
2016.

**Income recognition**
The Group applies IAS 18 Revenue.

Income, consisting of commissions and collection fees is recognized on collection of the debt.
Subscription income is recognized proportionately over the term of the underlying service contracts,
which is usually one year.

**Financial income and expenses**
Financial income and expenses consist of interest income on bank balances and receivables and
interest-bearing securities, bank fees, interest expenses on loans, dividend income, exchange rate
differences, realized and unrealized gains on financial investments, and derivatives used in financial
operations.

**Payment guarantees**
Intrum Justitia offers some of the Group’s clients the opportunity, against payment, to obtain a
guarantee from Intrum Justitia regarding the clients’ receivables from their customers. The guarantee
entails an undertaking by Intrum Justitia to acquire the receivable from the creditor at its nominal value,
or a certain part thereof, once it has fallen overdue for payment by a certain number of days. The
income, in the form of a guarantee fee, is recognized when the guarantees are issued, while a liability
is recognized in the balance sheet for expected losses related to those guarantees. If the debtor fails
to make payment, Intrum Justitia acquires the claim. The disbursement is then recognized as an
acquisition of a receivable, less the liability recognized when the guarantee was issued.

**Cash flow statement**
The Group applies IAS 7 Cash flow statements.

The cash flow statement includes changes in the balance of liquid assets. The Group’s liquid assets
consist of cash and bank balances. Cash flow is divided into cash flows from operating activities,
investing activities and financing activities.

Cash flow from investing activities includes only actual disbursements for investments during the year.
Disbursements for the purchase of portfolios of overdue receivables are reported under cash flow from
investing activities, while the collection and repayment of such portfolios are reported under cash flow
from operating activities.

Foreign subsidiaries’ transactions are translated in the cash flow statement at the average exchange
rate for the period. Acquired and divested subsidiaries are recognized as cash flow from investing
activities, net, after deducting liquid assets in the acquired or divested company.


-----

**Earnings per share**
The Group applies IAS 33 Earnings per share.

Earnings per share consist of net earnings for the year (attributable to the Parent Company’s
shareholders) divided by a weighted average number of outstanding shares during the year. In this
context, treasury holdings of repurchased shares are not included in outstanding shares.

**Segments**
The Group applies IFRS 8 Operating Segments.

An operating segment is a part of the Group from which it can generate income and incur expenses and
for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating
decision maker, i.e. the CEO in deciding how to assess performance and allocate resources to the
operating segment.

Intrum Justitia’s operating segments are the geographical regions Northern Europe (Denmark, Estonia,
Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Sweden), Central Europe (Austria, Czech Republic,
Germany, Hungary, Slovakia and Switzerland) and Western Europe (Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy,
Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom). Central and joint expenses are spread across the
geographical regions in proportion to their purchasing power parity-adjusted revenues. The break-down
by geographical region is also used for internal monitoring in the Group.

Among other things, Note 2 details net revenue and operating earnings by geographic region. However,
interest income, interest expenses, assets and liabilities are not reported by segment. This is not
considered relevant because the distribution of financial items and parts of the balance sheet is
dependent on Group structure and financing, which are not affected by the actual performance of the
regions. Nor are actual reported interest income, interest expenses, assets and liabilities by segment
included in any internal reporting to the CEO.

**Parent Company’s accounting principles**
The Parent Company has prepared the annual report according to the Annual Accounts Act (1995:1554)
and recommendation RFR 2 Accounting for Legal Entities from the Swedish Financial Reporting Board.
RFR 2 means that the Parent Company, in the annual report for the legal entity, must apply all EUapproved IFRS and statements as far as possible within the framework of the Annual Accounts Act and
taking into account the connection between reporting and taxation. The recommendation specifies
exemptions and additions relative to IFRS.

Effective from the 2016 Annual Report, the Parent Company applies the updated version from January
2017 of RFR 2 Accounting for Legal Entities, which contains a clarification that, among other things,
requires that exchange rate differences on monetary items classified as expanded net investment in
foreign subsidiaries be reported in net financial items instead of as previously in other comprehensive
income. In the Parent Company’s financial statements, comparative figures from previous years have
been restated in accordance with this change in accounting principle.

_Differences between the Group’s and Parent Company’s accounting principles_
Differences between the Group’s and Parent Company’s accounting principles are indicated below. The
accounting principles for the Parent Company as stated below have been applied consistently to all
periods presented in the Parent Company’s financial statements.

_Subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures_
Shares in subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures are recognized by the Parent
Company at cost, including transaction costs less any impairment. Only dividends are recognized as
income.

_Group contributions and shareholders’ contributions for legal entities_
The company reports Group contributions and shareholders’ contributions in accordance with
statement UFR 2 of the Swedish Financial Reporting Board.


-----

Group contributions received are recognized as dividends and Group contributions paid are recognized
as shareholders’ contributions. Shareholders’ contributions are recognized directly in the shareholders’
equity of the recipient and capitalized in the shares and participating interests of the contributor, to the
extent impairment is not required.

_Other_
The Parent Company has no leases classified as finance leases in its own accounts or the consolidated
accounts.

No individual customer is responsible for generating more than two percent of the Group’s total
revenue.

The distribution of revenues and earnings by geographical region is based on where clients are located.

The geographical regions include Northern Europe (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, the Netherlands,
Norway, Poland and Sweden); Central Europe (Switzerland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Germany,
Hungary and Austria) and Western Europe (Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the UK).
Central and joint expenses are spread across the geographical regions in proportion to their purchasing
power parity-adjusted revenues. The break-down by geographical region is also used for internal
monitoring in the Group.

Intra-Group sales between the regions are made on commercial terms.

Internal transactions between the business areas Financial Services and Credit Management Services
relate to payment on commercial terms for work carried out within Credit Management regarding


-----

handling and collection of the Group’s purchased debt. Payment is made in the form of a commission
that is recognized as a cost within purchased debt, but which is eliminated in the Consolidated Income
Statement.

Interest income and expenses are not reported by segment. This is not considered relevant because
the distribution of financial items is dependent on Group structure and financing and is not affected by
the actual performance of the regions. Nor are actual reported interest income and expenses by
segment included in any internal reporting to the CEO.

All interest income is attributable to items that are not carried at fair value through profit or loss.

The operating earnings include interest income attributable to purchased debt amounting to
SEK 2,765 M (2,276), defined as the difference between the year’s collected amount and amortization
for the year.

Amortization comprises the portion of the cost of the portfolio that, owing to allocation under the
effective interest method, accrues over the current year.

The item Dividends from Group companies includes Group contributions received from subsidiaries in
Sweden in the amount of SEK 314 M (221), and, for 2015, an anticipated dividend from the subsidiary,
Intrum Justitia International AB of SEK 1,000 M.

Exchange rate differences from accounts receivable and accounts payable are reported in operating
earnings. The amounts were negligible.

Compared with the preceding year, the increase in Other financial expenses is primarily attributable to
bank fees and borrowing costs allocated to the period.

During the year, no taxes were recognized for operations that have been phased out or otherwise
disposed, or for capital gains.

The Group has operations in some 20 countries in Europe, with various tax rates. The current tax
expense for the year relates mainly to income taxes in Switzerland, Belgium, Finland, France, Norway,
the Czech Republic and Hungary. The Group’s Swedish companies paid no income tax for the relevant
year as they were able to utilize tax-loss carryforwards from historic losses.

Intrum Justitia AB is domiciled in Sweden where the nominal corporate tax rate in 2015 and 2016 was
22 percent. The following reconciliation explains the difference between the Group’s actual tax cost and
the expected tax cost taking the Swedish corporate tax rate into account:

Unrecognized tax assets regarding tax-loss carryforwards relate to the negative tax effect during the
year attributable to losses in countries where no deferred tax asset is recognized because it is not
probable that enough taxable profit will arise within the foreseeable future. Utilized previously
unrecognized tax assets pertaining to tax-loss carryforwards relate to the positive tax effect over the
year arising through the utilization of tax-loss carryforwards never previously recognized as deferred tax
assets.

When differences arise between the tax value and carrying value of assets and liabilities, a deferred tax
asset or tax liability is recognized. Such temporary differences mainly arise for purchased debt,
provisions for pensions and intangible assets. Deferred tax assets include the value of tax-loss
carryforwards in the instances where they are likely to be utilized to offset taxable surpluses within the
foreseeable future.

The deferred tax assets and income tax liabilities are expected to be due for payment in over one year.

The Group has tax-loss carryforwards that can be utilized against future earnings totaling
SEK 1,803 M (1,731). No deferred tax assets are recognized in the balance sheet since the tax-loss
carryforwards exist in companies where it is not expected to be possible to utilize them against taxable
earnings in the foreseeable future. In the calculation of deferred tax liabilities attributable to temporary
differences in the recognition of purchased receivables, however, SEK 91 M (94) has been subtracted,
corresponding to a cautiously calculated option to offset the deferred tax liabilities against tax losses in
the same country.

Tax-loss carryforwards in countries with maturities for the utilization of those carryforwards relate to
Poland with SEK 3 M (5), the Netherlands with SEK 151 M (150) and Slovakia with SEK 9 M (4). In
Poland, the taxloss carryforwards can be utilized only for a period of five years from the year of the loss,
in the Netherlands for nine years and in Slovakia for four years. No deferred tax assets are recognized
for the tax-loss carryforwards in these two countries.

Tax-loss carryforwards for which no deferred tax assets are recognized pertain mainly to Sweden with
SEK 895 M (852) and the UK with SEK 340 M (381). Most of the tax-loss carryforwards in Sweden
consist of the deficit in the Parent Company. As a consequence of the costs for the head office
expenses and financing costs, the Parent Company has for several years incurred a tax deficit, even
when taking in to account the group contributions received from the profitable companies conducting
business in Sweden. It is Intrum Justitia’s assessment that tax-loss carryforwards cannot be utilized
against positive taxable income in the foreseeable future without first restructuring the Group internally
so that, for example, the Parent Company’s interest expenses are transferred to foreign subsidiaries. If
such restructuring is implemented, it may be relevant to evaluate the tax-loss carryforwards in the
accounts. Because the tax-loss carryforwards exist in the Parent Company, they are not involved in the
impairment testing of goodwill that pertains to the business of the subsidiaries. Loss carryforwards in
Sweden may also be consumed through so-called CFC taxation on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries
with revenues subject to low tax rates.

Tax expenses recognized in other comprehensive income over the year amounted to SEK 20 M
(income 8). No tax has been recognized directly against equity.

Tax-exempt income and non-deductible expenses in the Parent Company consist primarily of share
dividends from subsidiaries, paid and expensed shareholder contributions, as well as impairment of
shares in subsidiaries. The Parent Company has accumulated tax-loss carryforwards of SEK 895 M
(852) at year-end as a result of both income items and unrealized translation differences recognized in
other comprehensive income. No deferred tax assets are recognized for these tax-loss carryforwards
since the Parent Company is not expected to have a positive taxable result in the next few years.

In accordance with the Board’s proposal, the 2015 and 2016 Annual General Meetings resolved to
authorize the Board, in the period until the relevant subsequent AGM, to acquire and transfer the
company’s own shares on the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange. The company’s holding of treasury shares
may not at any time exceed 10 percent of the total number of shares in the company. However, in
accordance with the Board’s decision, no shares were repurchased in 2016. In 2015, 1,499,808 shares
were repurchased for SEK 400 M.

Payments during the year regarding investments in intangible fixed assets amounted to SEK 117 M
(105) for the Group.

Capitalized expenditure for IT development is mainly generated internally using our own employees
and/or contracted consultants.

Client relations and goodwill are acquired in connection with business acquisitions. Other intangible
fixed assets are mainly acquired externally.

**Impairment testing for cash-generating units containing goodwill**
In 2016, the Group treated the following geographical regions as cash-generating units in the sense
referred to in IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.

The goodwill value is distributed among the cash-generating units as follows:

-----

Impairment testing of goodwill for each cash-generating unit was done prior to preparation of the annual
accounts. The recoverable amount is determined through an estimation of its value in use. For each
cash-generating unit, management has compiled a projection of annual future cash flows based on
historical experience and the company’s own plans and estimates for the future. The calculation is
based on a detailed forecast for the years 2017–2019 and thereafter an annual increase of 1 percent.
The cash flows have been discounted to present value applying the Group’s weighted average cost of
capital, which is estimated at 5.7 percent (6.5) per year before tax, corresponding to 4.6 percent (5.2)
per year after tax. The recoverable amount has been compared for each unit with the Group’s net book
value of the unit’s assets and liabilities. The test gave no indication of a need of goodwill impairment.

Impairment testing is based on a number of assumptions, where the outcome is judged to be most
sensitive to some of those assumptions in particular:

For 2018, annual revenue growth of 4 percent (4) is assumed, and for 2019, 2 percent (2), with each
SEK 1,000 in increased revenue being assumed to result in an increase in working capital of SEK 250
(250), that is, an “incremental increase in earnings” of 25 percent (25). For the period after 2019,
perpetual growth in cash flow of 1 percent (3) annually is assumed. The same assumptions were
applied for all three geographical regions. The same discount rates were also applied, since no
long-term difference can be identified between the regions’ growth potential or risk.

**Sensitivity analysis**
A sensitivity analysis has been performed, in which cash flows were discounted at 7 percent interest
after tax and a perpetual growth rate of zero percent was applied. Even with these assumptions,
impairment testing did not indicate any need to recognize impairment in goodwill for any of the three
regions.

A VAT receivable is incurred in the Netherlands when purchasing overdue receivables. The VAT portion
of the receivable can be recovered from the tax authorities if it is not collected from the debtor and is
therefore recognized as a separate receivable. The portion that is expected to be recovered within
twelve months is recognized as current.

In the Netherlands, bailiffs are private companies and expenses for collection cases paid to them can
sometimes be recovered from the bailiffs if their collection measures fail. When it emerges that Intrum
Justitia is entitled to request that the amount be returned from the bailiffs, the amount is moved from
Outlays on behalf of clients, to recover from bailiffs.

**20   Shareholders’ equity**
**Share capital**
According to the Articles of Association of Intrum Justitia AB (publ), the company’s share capital may
amount to not less than SEK 1,300,000 and not more than SEK 5,200,000. All shares are fully paid in,
carry equal voting rights and share equally in the company’s assets and earnings. No shares are
reserved for transfer.

There are 72,347,726 shares in the company, and the share capital amounts to SEK 1,594,893.02.

**Share repurchase**
No shares were repurchased in 2016. In 2015, 1,499,808 shares were repurchased for SEK 400 M. In
accordance with a resolution by the Annual General Meeting in April 2016, the 1,073,602 treasury
shares held at the time, having been repurchased in April–December 2015, were canceled and the


-----

number of registered shares in the company fell from 73,421,328 to 72,347,726. The share capital was
reduced by SEK 23,322, but was immediately restored through a bonus issue and transfer from
retained earnings.

**Other shareholders’ equity in the Group**
_Other paid-in capital_
Refers to equity other than share capital contributed by the owners or arising owing to the Group’s
shared-based payment programs. Also included are share premiums paid in connection with new
issues.

_Reserves_
Includes the translation reserve, which contains all exchange rate differences that have, since the
transition to IFRS in 2004, arisen in the translation of financial statements from foreign operations as
well as long-term intra-Group receivables and liabilities that represent an increase or decrease in the
Group’s net investment in the foreign operations. The amount also includes exchange rate differences
arising in the Parent Company’s external loans in foreign currency, which are intended to hedge the
Group’s translation exposure attributable to net assets in foreign subsidiaries.

_Retained earnings including net earnings for the year_
Refer to earnings in the Parent Company and subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated companies.
Provisions to the statutory reserve, excluding transferred share premium reserves, were previously
included in this item. Accumulated revaluations of the Group’s defined benefit pension provisions are
also included. Dividends paid and share repurchases are deducted from the amount.

Following the balance sheet date the Board of Directors proposed a dividend of SEK 9.00 per share
(8.25), or a total estimated payout of SEK 651 M (597).

**Other shareholders’ equity in the Parent Company**
_Statutory reserve_
Refers to provisions to the statutory reserve and share premium reserve prior to 2006. The statutory
reserve is restricted equity and may not be reduced through distributions of earnings.

_Share premium reserve_
When shares are issued at a premium, the amount exceeding their quota value is transferred to the
share premium reserve. Provisions to the share premium reserve as of 2006 are non-restricted equity.

_Fair value reserve_
Refers to unrealized exchange rate gains or losses on external loans in foreign currency, which are
intended to hedge the Group’s translation exposure attributable to net assets in foreign subsidiaries.
The fair value reserve is non-restricted equity.

Although, in previous years, unrealized gains or losses on non-current monetary transactions with
subsidiaries were also recognized in the fair value reserve, in adapting to the new version of RFR 2
Accounting for Legal Entities, these are reported in net financial items from 2016 and with retroactive
effect, and thus affect retained earnings.

The impact of the change is that the fair value reserve as of 1 January 2015 increases by SEK 1,152 M
through a reclassification from retained earnings and earnings of the year. For the year 2015 the
amount of SEK –48 M, and for the year 2016 the amount of SEK –28 M are reported among financial
items that would under the previous principles have been reported among other comprehensive
income.

_Retained earnings_
Refer to retained earnings from the previous year less the dividend paid and share repurchases.
Retained earnings are non-restricted equity.


-----

**Capital structure**
The company’s definition of capital corresponds to shareholders’ equity including holdings without a
controlling interest, which at year-end totaled SEK 4,130 M (3,166).

The measure of the Group’s capital structure applied for control purposes is consolidated net debt
divided by operating earnings where depreciation on fixed assets as well as amortization and
revaluations of purchased debt are added back.

Net debt is defined as the sum of interest-bearing liabilities and pension provisions less liquid funds and
interest-bearing receivables.

The Board has set financial targets for the Group whereby net debt divided by operating earnings after
reversal of depreciation, amortization and revaluations, on a rolling 12-month basis, should be between
2.0 and 3.0.

On December 31, 2016, this key financial indicator amounted to 1.9 (1.8), that is, lower than the
targeted interval.

**21   Pensions**
Employees in Intrum Justitia’s companies are covered by various pension benefits, some of which are
defined benefit plans and others defined contribution plans. The Group applies IAS 19 Employee
Benefits, which contains, among other things, uniform regulations on the actuarial calculation of
provisions for pensions in defined benefit plans.

Group employees in Norway and Switzerland are covered by pension plans funded through assets
under the management of insurance companies and are reported as defined benefit pension plans.
Employees in Germany are covered by an unfunded defined benefit pension plan that can be paid out
as a one-time sum or as monthly payments following retirement. In France and Italy, the company
makes provisions for onetime payments made to employees on retirement, and these provisions are
also reported according to the rules for defined benefit pension plans. In Belgium and Sweden, there
are pension plans, funded through insurance, which theoretically should have been reported as defined
benefit plans, but which are recognized as defined contribution plans since the company lacks sufficient
data to report them as defined benefit plans. See also below regarding the ITP 2 plan.

Among other things, IAS 19 requires pension costs for service in the current period to be reported in
the operating earnings, while the calculated interest expense on the pension liability and the interest
income from assets under management are reported in net financial items. Actuarial revaluations are
recognized in other comprehensive income.

Provisions for pensions reported in the balance sheet can be analyzed as follows:

Costs for employment in the current period are reported in operating earnings. Net interest
income/expense is reported under net financial items. Revaluations of the pension liability are included
in other comprehensive income in the amount of SEK 33 M (negative: 33) before tax.

In calculating Provisions for pensions, the following assumptions are used:

**Group**
**%                                                                             2016            2015**
**–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  ––––––––––––    ––––––––––––**
Discount rate............................................................................................... 0.75–2.50%   0.75–2.20%
Assumed rate of increase in compensation ...............................................   1.0–2.5%     1.0–2.5%
Assumed return on assets under management .........................................   1.0–1.4%     1.0–1.9%
Assumed pension increases.......................................................................   0.0–3.0%     0.0–3.0%
Future adjustment to social security base..................................................   2.0–4.2%   2.25–4.20%

The Group also finances a number of defined contribution plans, Consolidated expenses for these
amounted to SEK 92 M (89).

**Funded defined benefit pension plans**
For Group employees in Switzerland, commitments exist in the form of obligatory service pension plans
funded through insurance policies in the Swiss Life Collective BVG Foundation and in Transparenta
BVG Foundation. The funded commitments currently amount to SEK 246 M (268), and the fair value of
the assets under management is SEK 193 M (181). Consequently, the net pension liability is SEK 53 M
(87). The pension commitment is funded through insurance contracts. During the year Intrum Justitia
paid SEK 38 M (15) to the plan, while disbursements to retirees amounted to SEK 46 M (32). In 2017
payments to the plan are estimated at SEK 21 M, with disbursements to retirees of SEK 15 M. For these
pension plans, a discount rate of 1.0 percent is applied. An increase/decrease in the discount rate by
0.5 percentage points would entail the pension liability decreasing by 7.8 percent/increasing by
9.0 percent.

For the Group’s employees in Norway, there are commitments for a compulsory service pension, which
are secured through insurance with the insurance company Storebrand Livforsikring. The funded
commitments currently amount to SEK 77 M (70), and the fair value of the assets under management
is SEK 54 M (52). Consequently, the net pension liability is SEK 23 M (18). The pension commitment
is funded through insurance contracts. During the year Intrum Justitia paid SEK 1 M (1) to the plan,
while disbursements to retirees amounted to SEK 3 M (2). Even in 2017, payments to the plan are
estimated at SEK 1 M, with disbursements to retirees of SEK 2 M. For these pension plans, a discount
rate of 1.4 percent is applied.


-----

**ITP 2 plan**
The commitments for retirement and family pensions for the Group’s Swedish employees are secured
through insurance with Alecta according to the so-called ITP 1 and ITP 2 plans. ITP 1 includes
employees born in 1979 or later, while ITP 2 covers employees born in 1978 or earlier. ITP 1 is a defined
contribution plan. On the other hand, according to a statement from the Swedish Financial Reporting
Board, UFR 10, the ITP 2 plan is a multi-employer defined benefit plan. For the fiscal year, Alecta’s
clients have not been provided enough information to report their proportional share of the plan assets,
obligations and costs of the plan whereby it has not been possible to report the plan as a defined benefit
plan. Nor is there a contractual agreement how surpluses and deficits in the plan are to be distributed
among plan participants. The ITP 2 plan secured through insurance with Alecta is therefore reported by
Intrum Justitia as if it were a defined contribution plan. The insurance premiums are calculated
individually, depending on salary level, earlier vested pension and expected remaining service.At yearend Alecta’s surplus in the form of the collective funding ratio amounted to 149 percent (153). The
collective funding ratio consists of the market value of Alecta’s assets as a percentage of the insurance
obligations calculated according to Alecta’s actuarial assumptions, which do not conform to IAS 19.

Under the provisions of the ITP 2 plan, measures must be taken if the funding ratio falls below
125 percent (for example, in connection with an increase in the price of the subscription) or exceed
155 percent (for example, in connection with a premium reduction).

Intrum Justitia AB signed a three-year syndicated loan facility totaling SEK 7,500 M with Nordea Bank
AB and Swedbank on December 22, 2015, to replace the previous one from 2014. The loan limit of SEK
7,500 M can be utilized for borrowing in a number of different currencies.

On December 31, 2016, the loan framework had been utilized for loans in SEK totaling SEK 0 M (500),
in CHF totaling CHF 0 M (5), in EUR totaling EUR 15 M (115), in NOK totaling NOK 0 M (250), in PLN
totaling PLN 240 M (240) and in HUF totaling HUF 28,300 M (0). The unutilized portion of the facility
amounted to SEK 5,964 M (5,141).


-----

The loan carries a variable interest rate based on the interbank rate in each currency, with a margin.
The loan facility contains operations-related and financial covenants, including limits on certain financial
indicators. All of these covenants were fully met in 2016. In addition, the credit agreement includes
covenants that may restrict, condition or prohibit the Group from incurring additional debt, making
acquisitions, disposing of assets, making capital and finance lease expenditures, allowing assets to be
encumbered, changing the scope of the Group’s business and entering into a merger agreement.

On November 13, 2016, Intrum Justitia AB signed a commitment letter with a banking consortium
comprising among others Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley Bank, enabling the
refinancing of Lindorff ’s financial debt in connection with the combination. The commitment includes a
bridge financing facility of EUR 3.4 billion and a revolving credit facility of EUR 1.1 billion. The bridge
financing facility has a maturity of five years, but is expected to be replaced or refinanced through the
issuance of new bonds in the capital market. The revolving credit facility is supplied by five
Scandinavian banks and is both intended to provide support for the merged company’s liquidity needs
and to accommodate future investment opportunities. According to this commitment letter, certain
restrictions apply to the Group’s opportunities to incur new debt, extend existing revolving facilities, or
to sell assets and shares, and there are limits in terms of Intrum Justitia AB’s opportunities to pay
dividends.

In 2016, Intrum Justitia AB issued a private placement of EUR 160 M, compared with SEK 0 M in the
preceding year, and thus has total outstanding bonds of SEK 4,783 M (3,124).

In 2016, Intrum Justitia also issued a commercial paper that, at the end of the year, amounted to
SEK 1,124 M (635).

**Pledged assets**
Refers to deposits and restricted bank balances that can be claimed by clients, suppliers or authorities
in the event that Intrum Justitia were not to meet its contractual obligations.

**Payment guarantees**
The Group offers services whereby clients, against payment, obtain a guarantee from Intrum Justitia
regarding the clients’ receivables from their customers. This entails a risk being incurred that Intrum
Justitia must compensate the customer for the guaranteed amount in the event that the invoices are not
paid on time. In those cases where the guarantee comes into play, Intrum Justitia assumes the client’s
claim against its customer and takes over the continued handling of the case within the Purchased Debt
area of operations. The total guarantee at year-end amounted to SEK 124 M (230), of which receivables
overdue by more than 30 days amounted to SEK 16 M (99). Intrum Justitia’s risk in this business is
managed through strict credit limits and analyses of debtors credit status. As of year-end Intrum Justitia
had allocated SEK 1 M (3) in the balance sheet to cover payments that may arise due to the guarantee.

**Other**
The planned combination, subject to approval of the EU commission, is expected according to a
preliminary assessment to entail that Intrum Justitia and Lindorff in total will be charged with transaction
costs for refinancing and advisors by over SEK 1 billion. SEK 30 M of the costs for advisors has been
expensed in the income statement of Intrum Justitia for 2016. The majority of the expected future costs
would be avoided if the transaction would not be completed as planned. The apportionment of
transaction costs between Intrum Justitia and Lindorff was taken into consideration when determining
the ownership percentage that Lindorff’s owners will obtain in the combined entity.

In 2012, when Intrum Justitia acquired the Dutch company Buckaroo BV, a contingent additional
purchase consideration to the sellers was agreed that would be based on the results achieved by the
company during the period 2012–2014. Only part of the additional purchase consideration has been
paid. In 2015, the sellers initiated legal proceedings, bringing claims against Intrum Justitia and some
of its executives, demanding payment of additional purchase consideration. These demands are
motivated by claims that the actions of Intrum Justitia (and its executives) caused a worse result in
Buckaroo than expected, and thus a lower additional purchase consideration. Intrum Justitia refutes all
of these demands and has not made any provisions with regard to these disputes.

In the Netherlands, there is also a dispute between Intrum Justitia and two telecommunications
companies regarding accounts receivable acquired from those companies, where Intrum Justitia’s
opportunities to collect these receivables has been impeded as a result of a ruling by the Dutch
Supreme Court in combination with deficiencies in some of the telecommunication companies’ client
agreements. Intrum Justitia has partially withheld payment for the purchased accounts receivable and
has submitted a claim for compensation. One case has been referred to an arbitration panel for a ruling.
There is also a risk that former debtors may require repayments.

In Sweden, the Supreme Court issued a judgment in December 2016 regarding a claim against a
private individual that had been acquired by a financial company. The claim had originally arisen
through the sale of goods to a company that has subsequently been declared bankrupt, and where the
private individual liable for the claim has been a member of the board. According to the Supreme Court,


-----

the private individual is not liable against the financial company for the portion of the claim relating to
VAT, since the company that originally sold the goods had recovered the VAT from the Swedish Tax
Agency. Intrum Justitia is assessing the judgment with the help of legal expertise to consider whether
this could have any impact on the Group’s purchased debt operations. The best assessment is currently
that the judgment cannot be applied generally to the type of assets purchased by the Group and that
any impact on the Group’s earnings would not be material in any case.

The Group is otherwise involved in legal actions in the normal course of business. In the opinion of the
Board, none of these disputes are expected to give rise to any significant cost.

Salaries and other remuneration in the Group also include remuneration in forms other than cash
payments, such as a free or subsidized car, housing and meals. Parent Company figures strictly refer
to cash payments, however. For information on compensation to the Group’s senior executives, see
Note 28.

**28** **Terms and conditions of employment for senior executives**
**Remuneration principles for senior executives**
The 2016 Annual General Meeting adopted the following principles of remuneration for senior
executives, the President and the members of the Group Management Team. The proposal has been
prepared by the Board and its Remuneration Committee.

_Salary and remuneration philosophy_
Intrum Justitia is dependent on its employees to achieve ambitious objectives in a challenging
environment. The salary and remuneration philosophy seeks to ensure that they can be rewarded for
their valuable contributions to the company. In addition, behaviors and accomplishments are
encouraged and promoted that best support the Group’s business strategies and ensure that the Group
can attract the skills needed to be successful.

Remuneration levels should reflect the individual’s competence, responsibility and performance, and
should be competitive compared with similar companies in similar sectors in the same geographic area.
To ensure that appropriate behaviors are encouraged, and that efforts are focused in the appropriate
areas, remuneration levels need to be related to the objectives closely associated with the Group’s
business strategy and its four core values. Total remuneration consists of salary, short-term variable
salary long-term variable salary and other benefits.

_Short-term variable salary_
Short-term variable salary is linked mainly to financial targets and rewards short-term performance by
being fixed for a year at a time. The metrics are set individually for each member of Group Management
to reflect the Group’s business strategy and priorities. The financial metrics may reflect either financial
targets or other value generated for the company as detailed below. Short-term salary means that the
company’s expenses vary alongside the Group’s financial development and the employees’ individual
performance.

Short-term variable salary is capped at 20–50 percent of fixed annual salary.

The cost for Intrum Justitia’s short-term variable salary programs for the President and other senior
executives for 2016 is estimated to amount to at most SEK 11 M, excluding social security expenses.


-----

_Long-term variable salary_
Through the long-term variable salary program, Group Management’s long-term interests and
perspectives are brought onto an equal footing with those of shareholders, while commitment to the
company is also reinforced. This encourages the long-term generation of value over a three-year
period, allowing Group Management to participate financially in the company’s success. Growth in
Intrum Justitia’s earnings per share is applied as a metric because this is considered a good indicator
of the Group’s long-term success. As with short-term salary, an effect of the program’s design is that
the cost varies alongside the Group’s financial performance.

Long-term variable salary is capped at 50 percent of fixed annual salary for the CEO and at
20–50 percent for other members of Group Management.

_Guidelines for individual share ownership_
To further encourage shareholder-like behavior and commitment among Group Management, there is
an expectation of individual share ownership that directly links the personal financial situation of
members of Group Management to the company’s development. This means that each member of the
Group Management is expected to own shares in Intrum Justitia equivalent to a certain percentage of
their annual salary before taxes – 100 percent for the President and 50 percent for other members of
Group Management. Share ownership should persist as long as these individuals remain employees
and members of Group Management.

Guidelines for share ownership were introduced in 2015, and each person has a certain amount of time
(based on individual agreements) to acquire shares.

_Other_
In the event of termination by Intrum Justitia, a maximum of 12 months’ severance pay shall apply (if at
all). Deviations exist in the case of a few existing employment contracts. The Board of Directors shall
have the right to depart from the established principles if there is particular justification for doing so in
individual cases.

**Role of the Remuneration Committee**
The Board of Directors has a Remuneration Committee whose task is to address the Group’s
remuneration issues on behalf of shareholders and the Board. The Remuneration Committee is
responsible for preparing the Group’s remuneration guidelines, which include general principles for how
salaries and other remunerations are determined, as well as addressing remuneration issues concerning
the CEO and Group Management. The Remuneration Committee comprises three Board members.
Since the 2016 Annual General Meeting, the Remuneration Committee has consisted of Lars Lundquist
(Chairman), Synnöve Trygg and Magnus Yngen. The CEO and the company’s Chief Human Resources
Officer are co-opted to the committee’s meetings, though not when their own remuneration is discussed.

**Terms of employment and remuneration of the CEO**
During 2016, Mikael Ericson, CEO and President between March and December 2016, received
remuneration in accordance with the Group’s principles as detailed above. His fixed annual salary for
2016 amounted to SEK 4,210,000. In addition, he had the opportunity to receive variable compensation
up to 100 percent of his base salary, 50 percent within the framework of the short-term variable salary
program and 50 percent within the framework of the 2014 long-term remuneration program, in
proportion to his period of employment. In addition to his salary, the company paid pension contributions
corresponding to 35 percent of his fixed annual salary. The pension policy is a defined contribution plan
and the retirement age is 65 years. He also had a company car in accordance with the Group’s car
policy, as well as subsidized meals under the same terms as other Group employees in Sweden.

Lars Wollung was President and CEO January–October 2015. His fixed annual salary for 2015
amounted to SEK 5,650 thousand, and he had the opportunity to receive variable compensation of up
to 200 percent of his annual salary, of which 50 percent was within the framework of the shortterm
remuneration program and 150 percent within the framework of the 2013 long-term remuneration
program. In addition to his salary, the company paid pension contributions corresponding to 35 percent
of his fixed annual salary. The pension policy is a defined contribution plan and the retirement age is
65 years. He had a company car in accordance with the Group’s car policy, as well as subsidized meals
under the same terms as other Group employees in Sweden.


-----

Lars Wollung left his position as President and CEO in early November 2015, in accordance with a
decision by the Board of Directors, and he thus received salary during the period of notice, as well as
severance pay, as set out in the employment agreement. Earnings for 2015 were burdened by a
provision for expenses for future payments to Lars Wollung regarding salary during the period of notice,
severance pay totaling SEK 11 M and SEK 10 M regarding variable remuneration. In addition, primarily
social security expenses and pension expenses for this remuneration were charged against earnings
for 2015 in the amount of SEK 9 M. In 2016, disbursements have been made in accordance with the
provisions made in 2015.

The provision for variable compensation is included below in the table showing variable compensation
earned in 2015.

**Terms of employment and remuneration for other members of Group Management**
During 2016, other members of Group Management also had benefit levels in accordance with the
Group’s principles as detailed described above. This includes their fixed annual salary and the
opportunity to receive variable remuneration of up to 100 percent of their annual salary, of which 20–50
percent was under the short-term remuneration program and 20–50 percent under the long-term
remuneration program. Pension benefits vary from country to country. In several cases, they are
included in monthly salaries. Pension policies are defined contribution plans, and the retirement age is
generally 65. Members of Group Management have company cars, in accordance with the Group’s car
policy. Smaller benefits also occur according to local practice, such as subsidized meals and travel.

During the period November 2015 – February 2016, the Group’s Chief Financial Officer, Erik Forsberg,
was the acting CEO and he received a salary supplement totaling SEK 300,000 during this period,
whereof SEK 100,000 in 2016.

The notice of termination for members of Group Management Team varies from three to twelve months,
regardless of whether termination is initiated by the employee or the company.

**Remuneration for the year**
Other senior executives in the table are defined as members of Group Management (see pages •–•)
other than the CEO. The figures include remuneration to Alessandro Pappalardo who was a member of
Group Management in 2015 and almost all of 2016, but who left the company shortly before the end of
2016. Consequently, a total of nine people are included for both years.

Amounts given correspond to full compensation for the relevant year, including earned but not yet paid
variable remuneration for the relevant year. This entails, for example, that the variable remuneration
accrued and expensed by the company in 2015 was disbursed in 2016, while the variable remuneration
for 2016 was disbursed in 2017.

No share-based remunerations were paid in 2015 or 2016.

**Trend in remuneration levels in recent years**
As shown above, the trend in earnings per share is assessed to be the best indicator of the company’s
long-term growth in shareholder value, and accordingly the outcome of the long-term variable salary
program is based primarily on the trend in earnings per share.

The short-term variable salary program is measured primarily against financial targets in the annual
business plans, such as operational performance, operating profit or operating profit after cost of
capital. By consistently meeting these targets, value is generated for shareholders and growth in
earnings per share is supported over time.

In 2015 and 2016, the company enjoyed strong growth in earnings per share and, over both years, the
company had a favorable earnings trend compared both with previous years the business plans. The
favorable growth in value and in earnings per share that has benefited shareholders is reflected in total
variable remuneration to Group Management also having increased over the same period:

**2016** **2015** **2014** **2013**
–––––––      –––––––      –––––––      –––––––
Variable salary, SEK M .................................   14,463       23,809       25,145       27,058
Earnings per share, SEK..............................    20.15        15.92        13.48        10.30

Annual growth in earnings per share, % ......      27           18           31           41

Variable remuneration for 2014 and 2015 was lower than in 2013 because the number of members of
Group Management entitled to variable remuneration decreased through personnel leaving the
company. Variable remuneration for 2016 was lower than in 2015 due to the change of CEO.

**Board of Directors**
In accordance with the Annual General Meeting’s resolution, total fees paid to Board members for the
year, including for committee work, amounted to SEK 3,715,000 (3,605,000). Board fees are distributed
between Directors as determined by the AGM according to the proposal of the Nomination Committee.
The Directors have no pension benefits or severance agreements.

Lease costs for operating leases amounted to SEK 135 M (120) during the year, of which SEK 1 M (1)
in the Parent Company.

Operating leasing primarily refers to offices for the Group’s operations in its countries. No single lease
is of material significance to the Group in terms of amount.

The only financial instruments that are regularly restated at fair value are derivatives (for example
forward exchange contracts). They are valued based on a valuation technique that uses observable
market data and thus falls under Level 2 in the valuation hierarchy according to IFRS 13.


-----

Financial assets include the balance sheet items: purchased debt, other long-term receivables,
accounts receivable, client funds, other current receivables, accrued income, derivatives with positive
value, cash and cash equivalents and, for the Parent Company, intra-Group receivables.

The total recognized value of consolidated financial assets amounted to SEK 10,692 M (8,757) on the
balance sheet date. Financial assets classified as loan receivables and accounts receivable amounted
to SEK 10,678 M (8,749) and financial assets recognized at fair value through profit or loss amounted
to SEK 14 M (8).

The total recognized value of the Parent Company’s financial assets amounted to SEK 6,714 M (6,977)
on the balance sheet date. Financial assets classified as loan receivables and accounts receivable
amounted to SEK 6,700 M (6,969) and financial assets recognized at fair value through profit or loss
amounted to SEK 14 M (8).

Financial liabilities include the balance sheet items: non-current and current liabilities to credit
institutions, bond loans, commercial papers, client funds payable, accounts payable, advances from
clients, other current liabilities, accrued expenses, prepaid income and, for the Parent Company, intraGroup liabilities.

The total recognized value of consolidated financial assets amounted to SEK 9,252 M (8,110) on the
balance sheet date. Financial liabilities recognized at amortized cost amounted to SEK 9,239 M (8,100)
and financial liabilities recognized at fair value amounted to SEK 13 M (10).

The total recognized value of the Parent Company’s financial liabilities amounted to SEK 11,723 M
(10,304) on the balance sheet date. Financial liabilities recognized at amortized cost amounted to
SEK 11,710 M (10,294) and financial liabilities recognized at fair value amounted to SEK 13 M (10).

_Purchased debt_
Purchased debt is classified as loan receivables and recognized at amortized cost according to an
effective interest method. The Group determines the carrying value by calculating the present value of
estimated future cash flows at the receivables’ original effective interest rate. Adjustments are
recognized in the income statement. With this valuation method, the carrying value is the best estimate
of the fair value of debt portfolios, in the company’s opinion. On the balance sheet date, the recognized
value of purchased debt amounted to SEK 8,733 M (7,027). An account of purchased debt by year
acquired is provided in Note 34.

_Accounts receivable_
Accounts receivable are recognized at amortized cost with no discount being applied since the
remaining maturity is judged to be short. Accounts receivable amounted to SEK 305 M (285) on the
balance sheet date.

_Other receivables_
Other receivables have short maturities. Receivables in foreign currency are translated in the accounts
at balance sheet date rates. Consequently, carrying value corresponds to fair value. Other receivables,
including accrued income, amounted to SEK 1,259 M (1,180) on the balance sheet date. The item
includes derivatives valued at SEK 14 M (8), which are classified as assets measured at fair value
through profit or loss (held for sale). The remaining SEK 1,245 M (1,172) is classified as loan
receivables. For the Parent Company, other receivables, including receivables from Group companies,
amounted to SEK 6,707 M (6,939). The item includes derivatives valued at SEK 14 M (8), which are
classified as assets measured at fair value through profit or loss (held for sale). The remaining
SEK 6,693 M (6,931) is classified as loan receivables.

_Liquid assets_
Liquid assets mainly consist of bank balances. Liquid assets in foreign currency are translated in the
accounts at balance sheet date rates. Consequently, carrying value corresponds to fair value. Cash and
bank balances are classified as loan receivables and amounted at year-end to SEK 396 M (265). For
the Parent Company, the corresponding amount was SEK 8 M (37) on the balance sheet date).


-----

_Liabilities to credit institutions_
The Parent Company’s and the Group’s loan liabilities carry market rate interest with short fixed interest
terms. Liabilities in foreign currency are translated in the accounts at balance sheet date rates.
Consequently, carrying value corresponds to fair value. On the balance sheet date, consolidated
liabilities to credit institutions amounted to SEK 1,576 M (2,356) and for the Parent Company, they
amounted to SEK 1,576 M (2,355).

_Bond loan_
The Parent Company and the Group had bond loans outstanding for a value of SEK 4,783 M (3,124)
on the balance sheet date.

_Commercial papers_
The Parent Company and the Group had commercial papers outstanding for a value of SEK
1,124 M (635) on the balance sheet date.

_Accounts payable_
Accounts payable have short maturities. Liabilities in foreign currency are translated in the accounts at
balance sheet date rates. Consequently, carrying value corresponds to fair value. Consolidated
accounts payable amounted to SEK 140 M (139). For the Parent Company, the equivalent amount was
SEK 10 (4).

_Other liabilities_
The Parent Company’s and the Group’s other liabilities have short maturities. Liabilities in foreign
currency are translated in the accounts at balance sheet date rates. Consequently, carrying value
corresponds to fair value. Other liabilities, including accrued expenses amounted to SEK 1,629 M on
the balance sheet date (1,856). The item includes derivatives for SEK 13 M (10), recognized at fair
value in the income statement (held for sale). Other liabilities, excluding these derivatives amounted to
SEK 1,616 M (1,846).

For the Parent Company, other liabilities amounted to SEK 4,230 M (4,185) on the balance sheet date
and included liabilities to Group companies and accrued expenses. Derivatives are recognized at fair
value through profit or loss (held for sale) and amounted to SEK 13 M (10). Other liabilities, excluding
these derivatives amounted to SEK 4,217 M (4,175).

_Offset of financial instruments_
Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value comprise currency derivatives. Financial assets
and liabilities are not offset in the balance sheet. However, there are legally binding agreements that
allow offsetting should one of the counterparties for the Group’s currency derivatives suspend their
payments. At the end of the year, Intrum Justitia had financial assets totaling SEK 2 M (6) that could be
offset against debts should the counterparties suspend their payments.

**34** **Financial risks and financial policies**
**Principles of financing and financial risk management**
The financial risks that arise in Intrum Justitia’s operations are limited. Thanks to a strong cash flow,
combined with little need for investment and operating capital, external capital needs in the Group’s
Credit Management operations are relatively low. The purchased debt operations have a greater need
for capital, particularly during a growth phase.

Intrum Justitia’s financing and financial risks are managed within the Group in accordance with the
treasury policy established by the Board of Directors. The treasury policy contains rules for managing
financial activities, delegating responsibility, measuring and identifying financial risks and limiting these
risks.

Internal and external financial operations are concentrated in Group Treasury in Stockholm, which
ensures economies of scale when pricing financial transactions. Because Group Treasury can take
advantage of temporary cash surpluses and deficits in the Group’s various countries of operation, the
Group’s total interest expense can be minimized.


-----

**Market risk**
Market risk consists of risks related to changes in exchange rates and interest rate levels.

_Exchange rate risk_
Exchange rate risk is the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates will negatively affect the Group’s
income statement, balance sheet and/or cash flows. The most important currencies for the Intrum
Justitia Group, other than the Swedish krona (SEK), are the euro (EUR), the Swiss franc (CHF), the
Hungarian forint (HUF), the Danish krone (DKK), the Norwegian krone (NOK) and the Polish
zloty (PLN).

The following exchange rates have been used to translate transactions in foreign currency in the
financial accounts:

**Dec 31,** **Dec 31,** **Average** **Average**
**Currency** **2016** **2015** **2016** **2015**
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– ––––––– ––––––– ––––––– –––––––

CHF...............................................................     8.91         8.51         8.69         8.77
HUF...............................................................   0.0308       0.0293       0.0304       0.0302
DKK ..............................................................     1.29         1.23         1.27         1.25
NOK ..............................................................     1.05         0.96         1.02         1.05
PLN...............................................................     2.16         2.17         2.17         2.24

Exchange rate risk can be divided into transaction exposure and translation exposure. Transaction
exposure consists of net operating and financial receipts and disbursements in different currencies.
Translation exposure consists of the effects from the translation of the financial reports of foreign
subsidiaries and associated companies to SEK.

_Transaction exposure_
In each country, all income and most operating expenses are denominated in local currencies, and thus
currency fluctuations have only a limited impact on the company’s operating earnings in local currency.
National operations seldom have receivables and liabilities in foreign currency. Income and expenses
in national currency are thereby hedged in a natural way, which limits transaction exposure. The
currency exposure that arises within the operating activities is limited to the extent it pertains to
international collection operations. The subsidiaries’ projected flow exposure is not hedged at present.
All major known currency flows are hedged on a continuous basis in the Group and the Parent
Company through forward exchange contracts.

_Translation exposure_
Intrum Justitia operates in 20 countries. The results and financial position of subsidiaries are reported
in the relevant foreign currencies and later translated into SEK for inclusion in the consolidated financial
statements. Consequently, fluctuations in the SEK exchange rate against these currencies affect
consolidated income and earnings, as well as equity and other items in its financial statements.

The Group’s revenues are distributed by currency as follows:

An appreciation of the Swedish krona of 10 percentage points on average in 2016 against EUR would
thus, all else being equal, have affected revenues by SEK –303 M, against CHF by SEK –72 M, against
HUF by SEK –48 M, against DKK by SEK –28 M, against PLN by SEK –26 M and against NOK by
SEK –22 M.

In terms of net assets by currency, shareholders’ equity in the Group, excluding non-controlling
interests, is distributed as follows:

An appreciation of the Swedish krona of 10 percentage points as per December 31, 2016 against EUR
would have affected shareholders’ equity in the Group by SEK –172 M, against CHF by SEK –28 M,
against DKK by SEK –2 M, against HUF by SEK –29 M, against NOK by SEK –4 M and against PLN
by SEK –10 M.

Regarding the currency risk attributable to currency interest rate swaps, see the description below
under Interest rate risks.

_Interest rate risks_
Interest rate risks relate primarily to the Group’s interestbearing net debt, which amounted to
SEK 7,260 M (6,026) on December 31, 2016. The loan rate is tied to the market rate.

Intrum Justitia has a strong cash flow which gives the Group the option of repaying loans,
repurchasing treasury shares or investing in overdue receivables. The Group’s loans have short fixed
interest terms – currently about eight months (seven) for the entire loan portfolio.

A one-percent increase in market interest rates would have adversely affected net financial items by
approximately SEK 66 M. A five-percent increase would have adversely affected net financial items by
SEK 332 M.

In 2012 the Parent Company issued bonds for SEK 1,000 M, in 2013 for a further SEK 1,000 M, and in
2014 for a further SEK 1,000 M. No new bonds were issued in 2015. In 2016, bonds were issued for
EUR 160 M through a private placement to the Swedish Export Credit Corporation. On the balance
sheet date, reported debt totaled SEK 4,783 M (3,124). To achieve suitable currency matching in the
balance sheet and thus manage the currency risk between assets and liabilities, the company used
currency interest rate swaps. Consequently, the Parent Company has exchanged the liability to the
bond holders in SEK with one of the relation banks, receiving EUR at the same rate on both the start
and closing dates. The company has thus maintained the level at which it secures shareholders’ equity
in EUR at the same level as prior to the issue and has also maintained its currency exposure in the
same currency.


-----

**Liquidity risk**
Liquidity risk is the risk of a loss or higher-than-expected costs to ensure the Group’s ability to fulfill its
short and long-term payment obligations to outside parties.

The Group’s long-term financing risk is limited through long-term financing in the form of committed
lines of credit. The Group’s objective is that at least 35 percent of total committed loans have a
remaining maturity of at least three years and that not more than 35 percent of the total have a
remaining maturity of less than 12 months.

The Group has a syndicated loan facility of SEK 7,500 M from Nordea and Swedbank. The maturity
structure means that the bank loan matures by SEK 2.5 billion each year in 2018, 2019 and 2020
respectively.

While available, the facility was utilized by the Parent Company, which withdrew amounts in various
currencies, with short maturities, usually SEK, EUR, CHF, HUF, NOK or PLN and usually with maturities
of three to six months. The loan is carried primarily in foreign currency, to hedge the Group against
translation exposure in relation to net assets outside Sweden.

The Group’s loan facility is subject to operational and financial conditions. If the limits are exceeded the
loans fall due. The Group Management Team carefully monitors these key financial indicators, so that
it can quickly take measures if there is a risk that a limit may be exceeded.

Intrum Justitia AB has signed a commitment letter with a banking consortium, enabling the refinancing
of Lindorff ’s financial debt in connection with the combination. The commitment includes a bridge
financing facility of EUR 3.4 billion and a revolving credit facility of EUR 1.1 billion. The bridge financing
facility has a maturity of five years, but is expected to be replaced or refinanced through the issuance
of new bonds in the capital market. The revolving credit facility is supplied by five Scandinavian banks,
and is both intended to provide support for the merged company’s liquidity needs and to accommodate
future investment opportunities.

In 2012 bond program for SEK 3,000 M was launched in which the Parent Company issued
SEK 1,000 M over five years with an interest margin of 3.10 percent in 2012, a further SEK 1,000 M
over five years with an interest margin of 2.22 percent in 2013, and a further SEK 1,000 M over five
years with an interest margin of 1.60 percent in 2014. No new bonds were issued in 2015. In 2016,
bonds were issued for EUR 160 M through a private placement to the Swedish Export Credit
Corporation with an interest margin on market terms.

Intrum Justitia has also issued commercial papers with a carrying amount of SEK 1,124 M (635) at
year-end.

The Group’s aim is that the liquidity reserve, which consists of cash, bank balances and short-term
liquid investments should amount to at least SEK 100 M more than the unutilized portion of committed
lines of credit. The Group has deposited its liquid assets with established financial institutions where the
risk of loss is considered remote. The Group’s finance function prepares regular liquidity forecasts with
the purpose of optimizing the balance between loans and liquid funds so that the net interest expense
is minimized without, for that matter, incurring difficulties in meeting external commitments.

The table below provides an analysis of the financial liabilities of the Group and the Parent Company
broken down according to the amount of time remaining until the contractual maturity date. The
amounts given in the table are the contractual, undiscounted cash flows. The amounts falling due within
12 months agree with the reported amounts since the discount effect is negligible.

**Credit risks**
Credit risk consists of the risk that Intrum Justitia’s counterparties are unable to fulfill their obligations
to the Group.

Financial assets that potentially subject the Group to credit risk include cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, purchased debt, outlays on behalf of clients, derivatives and guarantees. For
financial assets owned by Intrum Justitia, no collateral or other credit reinforcements have been
received. The maximum credit exposure for each class of financial assets therefore corresponds to the
carrying amount.

_Liquid assets_
The Group’s cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of bank balances and other short-term
financial assets with a remaining maturity of less than three months. The Group has deposited its liquid
assets with established financial institutions where the risk of loss is considered remote.

_Accounts receivable_
The Group’s accounts receivable from clients and debtors in various industries, and are not
concentrated in a specific geographical region. The Group’s largest client accounts for less than two
percent of revenues. Most accounts receivable outstanding are with customers previously known to the
Group and whose creditworthiness is good. For an analysis of accounts receivable by age, see Note
16.


-----

_Purchased debt_
As part of its operations, Intrum Justitia acquires portfolios of consumer receivables and tries to collect
them. Unlike its conventional collection operations where Intrum Justitia works on behalf of clients in
return for commissions and fees, in this case it assumes all the rights and risks associated with the
receivables. The portfolios are purchased at prices significantly below their nominal value, and Intrum
Justitia retains the entire amount it collects, including interest and fees.

The acquired receivables are overdue and in many cases are from debtors who are having payment
problems. It is obvious, therefore, that the entire nominal amount of the receivable will not be recovered.
On the other hand, the receivables are acquired at prices significantly below their nominal value. The
risk in this business is that Intrum Justitia, at the time of acquisition, overestimates its ability to collect
the amounts or underestimates the costs of collection. The maximum theoretical risk is of course that
the entire carrying value of SEK 8,733 M (7,027) would become worthless and have to be written off.

To minimize the risks in this business, Intrum Justitia exercises prudence in its purchase decisions. The
focus is on small and medium-sized portfolios with relatively low average amounts, to help spread risks.
The average nominal value per case is approximately SEK 11,950. Portfolios are normally acquired
from customers with whom the Group has had a long-term relationship. The acquisitions generally
involve unsecured debt, requiring relatively less capital and significantly simplifying administration
compared with collateralized receivables. Intrum Justitia places high yield requirements on the
portfolios it acquires. Before every acquisition, a careful assessment is made based on a projection of
future cash flows (collected amount) from the portfolio. In these calculations Intrum Justitia benefits
from its extensive experience in debt collection and from the Group’s scoring methods. Intrum Justitia
therefore believes that it has the expertise required to evaluate these types of receivables. To enable
acquisitions of larger portfolios at attractive risk levels, Intrum Justitia has, on occasion, partnered with
other companies such as Crédit Agricole, Goldman Sachs and East Capital to share the capital
investment and return.

The currency risk is attributable to the translation of the balance sheet item Purchased debt is limited
due to currency hedging using loans in the same currency as the assets, and currency forwards.

A considerable proportion of purchased debt acquisitions take place through forward flow agreements –
that is, Intrum Justitia may have previously agreed with a company to acquire all of that company’s
accounts receivable at a certain percentage of their nominal value once they are overdue by a certain
number of days. In most of these agreements, however, Intrum Justitia has the opportunity to decline
to acquire the receivables if, for example, their quality decreases.

Risks are diversified by acquiring receivables from clients in different sectors and different countries.
The Group’s purchased debt portfolios include debtors in 21 countries. The Group’s total carrying
amount for purchased debt is distributed as follows:


-----

The Group’s purchased debt portfolios are distributed by sector as follows:

Of the total carrying value on the balance sheet date, 33 percent represents portfolio acquisitions in
2016, 20 percent acquisitions in 2015, 12 percent acquisitions in 2014 and 14 percent acquisitions in
2013. The remaining 21 percent relates to receivables acquired in or before 2012, which have therefore
been past due for more than four years. In the case of a large share of the oldest receivables, Intrum
Justitia has reached agreement with the debtors on payment plans.

_Outlays on behalf of clients_
As an element in its operations, the Group incurs outlays for court fees, legal representation,
enforcement authorities, etc., which can be charged to and collected from debtors. In many cases
Intrum Justitia has agreements with its clients whereby any expenses that cannot be collected from
debtors are instead refunded by the client. The amount that is expected to be recovered from a solvent
counterparty is recognized as an asset in the balance sheet on the line Other receivables.

_Derivative contracts_
The Parent Company and the Group hold forward exchange contracts to a limited extent. The credit risk
in the Group’s forward exchange contracts is because the counterparty generally is a large bank or
financial institution that is not expected to become insolvent. On the balance sheet date, assets
regarding forward exchange contracts were valued at SEK 14 M (8), and liabilities at SEK 13 M (10).
See Note 33 regarding the possibility of offsetting receivables and liabilities for derivative contracts.

The contracts have short maturities, typically one or more months. All outstanding forward exchange
contracts are restated at fair value in the accounts, with adjustments recognized in the income
statement. Changes in the value of forward exchange contracts recognized during the year in the
income statement amounted to SEK –5 M (–61). The purpose of these forward exchange contracts has
been to minimize exchange rate differences in the Parent Company attributable to receivables and
liabilities in foreign currency. These exchange rate differences amounted to SEK 1 M (59) during the
year. The net effect through profit or loss of exchange rate differences attributable to receivables and
liabilities as well as forward exchange contracts is SEK –4 M (–2).

Outstanding forward exchange contracts as of year-end of the Parent Company and the Group include
the following currencies:

**Local currency,** **Hedged amount,**
**Currency** **buy** **sell**
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– –––––––––––––   –––––––––––––

PLN.................................................................................................     12,252,204      –30,527,491

The Parent Company and the Group also hold currency interest rate swaps that were signed in
connection with the Parent Company’s issue of bonds in SEK. To achieve suitable currency matching
between assets and liabilities, liabilities in SEK were exchanged to EUR at the same rate on the starting
date and the date of maturity.


-----

_Payment guarantees_
The Group offers services whereby clients, against payment, obtain a guarantee from Intrum Justitia
regarding the clients’ receivables from their customers. This entails a risk being incurred that Intrum
Justitia must compensate the customer for the guaranteed amount in the event that the invoices are not
paid on time. In those cases where the guarantee comes into play, Intrum Justitia assumes the client’s
claim against its customer and takes over the continued handling of the case within the Purchased Debt
area of operations. The total guarantee at year-end amounted to SEK 124 M (230), of which receivables
overdue by more than 30 days amounted to SEK 16 M (99). Intrum Justitia’s risk in this business is
managed through strict credit limits and analyses of debtors’ credit status. As of year-end Intrum Justitia
had allocated SEK 1 M (3) in the balance sheet to cover payments that may arise due to the guarantee.

**35   Acquisitions of operations**
In the cash flow statement, SEK 252 M (181) is reported under the item Acquisitions of subsidiaries and
associated companies. For 2016, the amounts consist of the acquisitions of Segestión for SEK 38 M,
Dansk Kreditorservice for SEK 123 M, Debitoren Services for SEK 65 M and C&J Services for
SEK 13 M in accordance with the specifications below, and a shareholder contribution of SEK 14 M
made to Avarda AB. For 2015, the amounts consist of the acquisitions of Credita for SEK 33 M,
Logicomer for SEK 112 M and other acquisitions for SEK 36 M.

**Acquisition of 100 percent of the shares in Segestión**
On October 14, Intrum Justitia acquired the Spanish company Segestión Gabinete Tecnico
Empresarial, SL, and its subsidiaries,for a purchase consideration of EUR 10 M on net debt-free basis.
Segestión is a credit management company with a leading market position in the customer segment for
small and medium-sized enterprises, with 170 employees. The acquired company was consolidated
effective from October 2016 and has contributed to consolidated revenues by SEK 17 M and to
operating earnings by SEK 2 M. If the acquisition would have been executed by January 1, it would
have contributed to the Group’s revenues by SEK 70 M and to the operating result by SEK 10 M.

**Acquisition of 100 percent of the shares in Dansk Kreditorservice**
On October 3, Intrum Justitia acquired the Danish company Dansk Kreditorservice A/S (DKS) for a
consideration of DKK 95 M on a net debt-free basis. An additional DKK 15 M may be payable in 2018
if certain financial targets for 2017 are reached. DKS is a credit management company with a leading
market position in the segment for small and medium-sized enterprises, with 47 employees. DKS was
consolidated effective from October 2016 and has contributed to consolidated revenues by SEK 12 M

**Acquisition of 100 percent of the shares in Debitoren Services**
In February, Intrum Justitia acquired a small factoring company in Switzerland, Debitoren Services AG,
at a purchase consideration on a net debt-free basis of SEK 67 M. The company was consolidated
effective from February 2016 and has contributed to consolidated revenues by SEK 15 M and to
operating earnings by SEK 10 M. If the acquisition would have been executed by January 1, it would
have contributed to the Group’s revenues by SEK 16 M and to the operating result by SEK 9 M.

During the year, the company merged with Intrum Justitia Debt Finance Domestic AG.

**Other acquisitions in 2016**
On April 1, Intrum Justitia acquired a small credit management company in Belgium, C&J Credit
Services BVBA, for a purchase consideration of SEK 13 M. Consolidated goodwill amounted to
SEK 15 M. C&J Services merged with Intrum NV on June 30, 2016.

**Acquisitions after the balance sheet date**
Intrum Justitia concluded on November 10, 2016 an agreement to acquire 1st Credit, a medium-sized
company active in purchased debt in the UK. The purchase sum amounted to GBP 130 M on an
enterprise value basis attributable to a diversified debt portfolio from various sellers in the financial


-----

sector. 1st Credit’s operating earnings before depreciation and amortization on purchased debt
amounted to approximately GBP 33 M in 2015. The transaction was concluded in February 2017. The
purchase price allocation has not been finalized.

Intrum Justitia announced November 14, 2016, that Intrum Justitia and Lindorff ’s owners had reached
an agreement on a planned combination between Intrum Justitia and Lindorff, a Norwegian credit
management group with a similar business model as Intrum Justitia. Lindorff had revenues of
approximately SEK 6.4 billion for the twelve months ending September 30, 2016, and operating
earnings of approximately SEK 2.4 billion for the same period, pro forma for acquisitions and excluding
certain non-recurring items. Lindorff had approximately 4,200 employees in 13 countries in Europe. The
aim of the planned merger is to create the industry’s leading provider of credit management services.
The transaction will be carried out by Intrum Justitia acquiring all outstanding shares in Lindorff in
exchange for newly issued shares in Intrum Justitia. An Extraordinary General Meeting on December
14, 2016 resolved to approve the combination with Lindorff and authorized the Board to decide on a
new issue of shares as consideration for the shares in Lindorff. The number of new shares to be issued
shall not exceed the number of shares equivalent to 45 percent of the total number of shares
outstanding in the company after the issue. The completion of the transaction is subject to the approval
by the regulatory authorities in the relevant jurisdictions as well as by the EU Competition Authorities.

The transaction is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2017, depending on the time
needed to secure the aforementioned regulatory approvals. The purchase price allocation has not been
finalized.

**Acquisition in 2015 of 100 percent of the shares in Credita**
In February, Intrum Justitia acquired a smaller credit management company in Switzerland, Credita AG,
with a good market position in the public sector and health insurance. Credita AG had 19 employees.
The purchase price amounted to SEK 51 M. The acquired company was consolidated effective from
September 2015. The acquisition analysis was detailed in the 2015 annual report.

**Acquisition in 2015 of 100 percent of the shares in Logicomer**
In September, Intrum Justitia agreed to acquire the Portuguese company Logicomer Gestão e
Recuperação de Créditos SA, which operates primarily in credit management services, but also has a
purchased debt portfolio with a nominal value of approximately SEK 1.2 billion. The company has
40 employees and very good profitability. The purchase price amounted to SEK 187 M. The acquired
company was consolidated effective from September 2015. The acquisition analysis was detailed in the
2015 annual report.

**36   Critical estimates and assumptions**
To be able to prepare the accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices,
company management and the Board of Directors must make assessments and assumptions that affect
reported income and expense items, asset and liability items, as well as other disclosures. Management
has discussed with the Audit Committee the Group’s critical accounting principles and estimates as well
as the application of these.

Estimates and assumptions are continuously assessed on the basis of historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events considered reasonable under prevailing conditions.
Actual outcomes may vary from the assessments made.

The areas in which estimates and assumptions could entail significant risk of adjustment in the
recognized amounts for assets and liabilities in future financial years are primarily the following:

**Impairment testing of goodwill**
As indicated in Note 10, an impairment test of goodwill was performed prior to the preparation of the
annual accounts. The geographical regions are judged to achieve a sufficient degree of integration that
they form combined cash generating units. Recoverable amounts for cash generating units have been
established by calculating their value in use. The assumptions and assessments made with regard to
expected cash flows and discount rates in the form of weighted average cost of capital, as well as a
sensitivity analysis are detailed in Note 10. Projections of future cash flows are based on the best
possible assessments of future income and operating expenses.


-----

**Purchased debt**
As indicated in Note 14, the recognition of purchased debt is based on the company’s own projection
of future cash flows from acquired portfolios.

Although the company has historically had good projection accuracy with regard to cash flows, future
deviations cannot be ruled out.

The Group applies internal rules and a formalized decision-making process in the adjustment of
previously established cash flow projections. These entail, among other things, that cash flow
projections are only in exceptional cases adjusted in the first year of ownership of a portfolio.
Furthermore, the decision to amend a cash flow projection is preceded by a discussion between the
local management in the country in question and the management of the service line. All changes in
cash flow projections are ultimately decided on by a central revaluation committee.

**Divestment of purchased debt**
In an uncommon move, the Group divested certain purchased debt portfolios in 2016. Sales of
portfolios are not included in the business model for this type of asset, and consequently no accounting
principle had previously been developed for such transactions. Intrum Justitia has assessed the
transactions and concluded that a sale of purchased debt should be recognized in the same way as if
an amount equivalent to the selling price had been collected as part of normal operations. For Intrum
Justitia’s accounting, it does not matter if the same amount is received through collection from debtors
or by sale to an external party. The entire sale price for the portfolios sold has been reported as the
amount collected on purchased debt, and the entire carrying value remaining prior to the sale has been
reported as amortization of purchased debt.

**Useful lifetimes of intangible and tangible fixed assets**
Group management establishes assessed useful lifetimes and thus consistent amortization and
depreciation for the Group’s intangible and tangible fixed assets. These estimates are based on
historical knowledge of equivalent assets’ useful lifetimes. Useful lifetimes and estimated residual
values are tested on each balance sheet date and adjusted when necessary. Recognized values for
each balance sheet date for intangible and tangible fixed assets, see Notes 10 and 11.

**Assessment of deferred tax assets**
Deferred tax assets for tax-loss carryforwards or other future tax deductions are recognized to the
extent it is deemed likely that the deduction can be made against future taxable surpluses. Carrying
amounts for deferred tax assets on each balance sheet date are provided in Note 8.

**Reporting of Polish investment fund**
The Group has operated in Poland since 2006 through an investment fund designed to purchase and
own portfolios of written-off receivables. Intrum Justitia is the fund’s only owner, and from the Group’s
perspective it essentially operates like a subsidiary. Against this backdrop, Intrum Justitia has resolved
to consolidate the investment fund in the consolidated financial statements as a subsidiary.

**37   Related parties**
In addition to associated companies and joint ventures, related parties include the Board of Directors
and senior executives, according to Note 28, as well as close family members to these executives and
other companies over which they can exert a significant influence.

All transactions with related parties are conducted on market terms and at arm’s length.

In 2016, Intrum Justitia purchased services for SEK 2 M (1) from Caperio AB, an IT company whose
country manager in Sweden, Per-Henrik Persson is a Board member.

Although the Parent Company has close relationship to its subsidiaries, see Note 12, it has no
transactions with other related parties.


-----

Over the year, the Parent Company received SEK 105 M (102) in income from sales of services to
subsidiaries, and incurred SEK 11 M (9) in expenses attributable to services purchased from
subsidiaries.

**Audit Report**

**_To the Annual General Meeting of Intrum Justitia AB (publ), corporate identity number 556607-7581_**

**Report on the annual and consolidated accounts**
We have conducted an audit of the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts of Intrum Justitia
AB (publ) for the year 2015. The annual and consolidated accounts of the company are included in this
document on pages •–•.

**Responsibility of the board of directors and the president for the annual and consolidated**
**accounts**
The Board of Directors and the President are responsible for the preparation of annual accounts that
give an accurate view in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and consolidated accounts that give
an accurate view in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the
EU, and the Annual Accounts Act and for the internal controls deemed necessary by the Board of
Directors and President in preparing annual accounts that do not contain material misstatements,
whether these are due to irregularities or error.

**Auditors’ responsibility**
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the annual and consolidated accounts based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and generally accepted
auditing standards in Sweden. These standards demand that we adhere to professional requirements
and that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance that the annual and
consolidated accounts are free of material misstatement.

An audit entails gathering by various means audit evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the annual and consolidated accounts. The auditor selects the measures to be performed by assessing,
among other aspects, the risk for material misstatements in the annual and consolidated accounts,
whether these are due to irregularities or error. In this risk assessment, the auditor takes into account
those parts of the internal control processes that are relevant to how the company prepares the annual
and consolidated accounts to provide an accurate view with the purpose of drawing up review
measures that are appropriate to conditions, albeit not with the purpose of making any statements
regarding the efficacy of the company’s internal control processes. An audit also includes assessing the
appropriateness of the accounting principles used and the reasonableness of the estimates made by
the Board of Directors and President in the accounts, as well as assessing the overall presentation of
the annual and consolidated accounts.

We believe that the audit evidence we have gathered is sufficient and appropriate as a basis for our
statements.

**Statements**
In our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act
and present, in all material respects, a fair portrayal of the financial position of the Parent Company as
of December 31, 2015 and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year in accordance with
the Annual Accounts Act. The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with the
Annual Accounts Act and give, in all material respects, a fair portrayal of the financial position of the
Group as of December 31, 2015 and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year in
accordance with the Interim Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the EU, and the Annual
Accounts Act. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion set out below.

We therefore recommend that the Annual General Meeting approve the consolidated Income Statement
and Balance Sheet and the Income Statement and Balance Sheet of the Parent Company.

**Report on other legal and regulatory requirements**
In addition to our audit of the annual and consolidated accounts, we have also audited the proposed
appropriation of the company’s earnings and the administration of Intrum Justitia AB (publ) by the Board
of Directors and the President in 2015.


-----

**Responsibility of the board of directors and the president**
The Board of Directors is responsible for the proposed appropriation of the company’s earnings, and
the Board of Directors and the President are responsible for the administration of the Company in
accordance with the Companies Act.

**Auditors’ responsibility**
It is our responsibility, based on our audit, to express an opinion, with a reasonable degree of certainty,
on the proposed appropriation of the company’s earnings and the administration of the company. We
have conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden.

As a basis for our statement regarding the proposed appropriation of the company’s earnings, we have
reviewed the statement by the Board of Directors explaining its proposal and a selection of the data on
which this is based to ascertain whether the proposal complies with the Companies Act.

As a basis for our statement regarding discharge from liability, we have, in addition to our audit of the
annual and consolidated accounts, reviewed significant decisions, measures and conditions in the
company to ascertain whether any director or the President is liable for compensation to the company.
In our review, we have also considered whether any director or the President has in any other way
contravened the Companies Act, the Annual Accounts Act or the Articles of Association.

We believe that the audit evidence we have gathered is sufficient and appropriate as a basis for our
statements.

**Statements**
We recommend that the Annual General Meeting appropriate the company’s earnings in accordance
with the proposal presented in the statutory administration report (Board of Directors’ Report) and that
the directors and the President be discharged from liability for the financial year.

**Notes to the audited consolidated financial statements**

**1** **Significant accounting and valuation principles**
**General**
The Parent Company Intrum Justitia AB (publ) is a registered company domiciled in Stockholm,
Sweden. The address of the company’s headquarters is Hesselmans Torg 14, Nacka, SE-105
24 Stockholm, Sweden. In 2015, the company was listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm, Large Cap list.

The consolidated accounts were approved for publication by the company’s Board of Directors and
Chief Executive Officer on March 24, 2016.

The balance sheets and income statements will be presented to the Annual General Meeting on
April 20, 2016.

The Parent Company’s functional currency is Swedish kronor (SEK), which is also the reporting
currency for the Parent Company and for the Group. The financial statements are therefore presented
in SEK. All amounts, unless indicated otherwise, are rounded off to the nearest SEK M.

The consolidated and annual accounts pertain to January 1–December 31 for income statement items
and December 31 for balance sheet items.

**Accounting standards applied**
With regard to the consolidated financial statements, the annual report for Intrum Justitia AB (publ) has
been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and the International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The Group applies
IFRS as adopted by the European Union (EU). For 2015, there are no provisions relevant to Intrum
Justitia in the IFRS issued by the IASB that have not been adopted by the EU. This means that the
Group’s application of IFRS as adopted by the EU during the year also corresponds to the application
of IFRS as issued by the IASB.

Further, recommendation _RFR 1 Supplementary accounting rules for groups from the Swedish_
Financial Reporting Board has been applied.

The Parent Company applies the same accounting principles as the Group except in the cases stated
in the section “Parent Company accounting principles”.

**Assumptions**
Assets and liabilities are recognized at historical cost, with the exception of certain financial assets and
liabilities, which are measured at fair value.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the Board of Directors and
Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the accounting principles
and the carrying values of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Estimates and assumptions are
based on historical experience and a number of other factors that under current circumstances seem
reasonable. The result of these estimates and assumptions is then used to determine the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that otherwise are not clearly indicated by other sources. Actual
outcomes may deviate from these estimates and assumptions.

Estimates and assumptions are reviewed regularly. Changes in estimates are recognized in the period
in which the change is made, provided it has affected only this period, or the period the change was
made and future periods if the change affects both current and future periods.

Estimates made by the company that have a significant impact on the financial statements and
estimates, which could necessitate significant adjustments in financial statements in subsequent years,
are described in more detail in Note 36.

The accounting principles described below for the Group have been applied consistently for all periods
in the Group’s financial statements, unless otherwise indicated. The Group’s accounting principles have
been applied consistently in the consolidation of the Parent Company, subsidiaries, associated
companies and joint ventures.


-----

**Changes in accounting principles**
**_Changes that entered into force in 2015_**
Applicable effective from 2015 is interpretation IFRIC 21 Levies, which addresses how various fees
imposed by the central government are to be reported.

Intrum Justitia is not affected by this interpretation, and the annual accounts for 2015 have therefore
been prepared applying the same accounting policies and calculation methods as for the annual
accounts for 2014.

**_Changes that enter into force in or after 2016_**
The Group has decided against early application of any new or amended accounting recommendations
or interpretations that enter into force in or after 2016.

_IFRS 9 Financial instruments is intended to replace IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and_
_Measurement._ The IASB has prepared a package of changes regarding the accounting of financial
instruments. The package contains a model for the classification and measurement of financial
instruments, a forward-looking impairment model and a revised model for hedge accounting. IFRS 9 is
expected to enter into force in 2018 and early adoption is permitted on the condition that the EU adopts
the standard. The EU plans to approve the standard during the second half of 2016. Intrum Justitia’s
preliminary assessment is that the overdue receivables purchased by the Group shall, in accordance
with IFRS 9, continue to be recognized at amortized cost, as in IAS 39, and that the effect on the
consolidated financial statements will consequently not be significant. Intrum Justitia does not intend to
adopt IFRS 9 prematurely in 2016.

_IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers is intended to replace IAS 18 Revenue. The purpose_
of a new revenue standard is to have a single principle-based standard for all sectors that will replace
existing standards and statements regarding revenue. The sectors deemed most affected are the
construction and civil engineering sectors, as well as companies engaged in contract manufacturing.
However, all companies will be affected by the new expanded disclosure requirements. IFRS 15 is
expected to enter into force in 2018 and early adoption is permitted on the condition that the EU adopts
the standard. The EU plans to approve the standard during the first half of 2016. Intrum Justitia has
begun to map the effects of IFRS 15 on its financial statements and has yet to identify any significant
impact. The Group currently has no plans to adopt the standard early.

_IFRS 16 Leases_ was published in early 2016 and is intended to replace IAS 17 Leases. The new
standard contains rules entailing that leases, with certain exceptions, are to be reported as assets and
liabilities in the balance sheet, for both operational and financial leases. The most important effect on
Intrum Justitia’s accounts is that total assets will increase. IFRS 16 is expected to enter into force from
2019. The Group currently has no plans to adopt the standard early.

Other changes to IFRS are not expected to have any material effect on the consolidated accounts.

**Classification issues**
Fixed assets and long-term liabilities in the Parent Company and the Group consist of amounts that are
expected to be recovered or paid more than twelve months after the balance sheet date. Current assets
and current liabilities in the Parent Company and the Group consist of amounts that are expected to be
recovered or paid within twelve months of the balance sheet date.

**Consolidation**
**_Subsidiaries_**
The Group applies IFRS 3 Business combinations and IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements.

The consolidated accounts include the annual accounts of all subsidiaries, i.e., companies in which the
Parent Company, directly or indirectly, holds more than 50 percent of the votes or otherwise can
exercise control over operations. An investor controls an investee when the investor is exposed, or has
rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those
returns through its power over the investee. Control is achieved through existing rights that give it the
ability to direct the relevant activities, i e the activities that significantly affect the investee’s returns.


-----

The consolidated accounts are prepared according to the acquisition method, which means that the
acquisition of a subsidiary is treated as a transaction where the Group indirectly acquires the
subsidiary’s assets and takes over its liabilities and contingent liabilities. The Group’s equity therefore
includes only the portion of the subsidiary’s equity added since acquisition. The Group’s cost is
determined through an acquisition analysis in connection with the acquisition. The analysis determines
the cost of the shares or operations as well as the fair value of acquired, identifiable assets and
assumed liabilities and contingent liabilities. The cost of the subsidiary’s shares or operations consists
of the fair value of the compensation on the transfer date and transaction expenses directly attributable
to the acquisition. The cost includes conditional purchase considerations recognized as liabilities at fair
value per the acquisition date. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.

In acquisitions where the cost exceeds the net value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities and
contingent liabilities, the difference is reported as goodwill. When the difference is negative, it is
recognized directly in the income statement.

Non-controlling interests arise in cases where the acquisition does not relate to the entire subsidiary.
There are two options for recognizing non-controlling interests. The two options are to recognize the
percentage of non-controlling interests that makes up proportional net assets, or to recognize
non-controlling interests at fair value, which means that non-controlling interests form a percentage of
goodwill. The method used for recognizing non-controlling interests is made on a case by case basis.

The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated accounts from the acquisition
date until control ceases.

Intra-Group receivables and liabilities, income and expenses, and unrealized gains and losses that
arise from transactions within the Group are eliminated in their entirety in the consolidated accounts.

Unrealized gains arising from transactions with associated companies and joint ventures are eliminated
to a degree corresponding to the Group’s ownership of those companies. Unrealized losses are
eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, to the extent there is an indication of impairment.

**_Associated companies and joint ventures_**
The Group applies IAS 28 Investments in Associates and joint ventures.

Associated companies are companies that are not subsidiaries but where the Parent Company, directly
or indirectly, has at least 20 percent of the votes or otherwise exercises significant influence without
having control over the partly owned company.

Participations in associated companies and joint ventures are recognized in the consolidated accounts
according to the equity method, which means that the holding in the company is recognized at cost and
subsequently adjusted to the Group’s share of the change in the company’s net assets. The value of
the shares includes goodwill from the acquisition. The consolidated income statement includes the
Group’s participation in earnings less goodwill impairment. The amount is recognized on the line,
Participations in associated companies and joint ventures. Dividends received from the associated
company are not recognized in the income statement and instead reduce the carrying value of the
investment.

Any difference between the cost of an acquisition and the owner’s share of the net fair value of the
associated company’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognized in
accordance with IFRS 3.

The equity method is applied from the date a significant influence arises until the time it ceases or the
company becomes a subsidiary.

If the Group’s share of reported losses in the company exceeds the carrying value of its participations,
the value of those participations is reduced to nil. Losses can also be offset against the Group’s
unsecured receivables from the associated company if they constitute part of the net investment.
Further losses are not recognized provided the Group has not issued guarantees to cover them.


-----

**_Joint ventures_**
The Group applies IFRS 11 Joint arrangements.

Joint arrangements pertain to companies in which Intrum Justitia and other part-owners manage
operations jointly in accordance with a shareholder agreement. The Group has only been engaged in
joint arrangements classified as joint ventures, and these are reported in the consolidated financial
statements according to the equity method. This means that participations in jointly owned companies
are recognized at cost and subsequently adjusted for the Group’s share of the change in the company’s
net assets. The consolidated income statement includes the Group’s share of earnings, and this is
reported under Participations in the earnings of associates and joint ventures. Dividends received from
joint ventures are not recognized in the income statement and instead reduce the carrying value of the
investment.

The equity method is applied from the date on which joint control is gained until the date that it ceases
or transitions to the sole control of Intrum Justitia.

**Foreign currency**
The Group applies IAS 21 Effects of changes in foreign exchange rates.

**_Transactions in foreign currency_**
Group companies prepare their accounts in the local functional currency in the country where they have
their operations. Transactions in a currency other than the local currency are recognized at the
exchange rate in effect on the transaction day. When such transactions are offset or settled, the
exchange rate may deviate from the one that applied on the transaction day, in which case a (realized)
exchange rate difference arises. Moreover, monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are
translated at the exchange rates on each balance sheet date, due to which an (unrealized) exchange
rate difference arises. Both realized and unrealized exchange rate differences of this type are
recognized in the income statement – in the operating result if, for example, they refer to accounts
receivable or accounts payable, or in net financial items if they refer to financial investments and
borrowing in foreign currency.

To avoid exchange rate differences, receivables and liabilities in foreign currency are sometimes
hedged through forward exchange contracts. The Group’s holding of forward exchange contracts is
marked to market on each balance sheet date, and changes in value are recognized in the income
statement.

**_Translation of the financial statements of foreign operations_**
Assets and liabilities in foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments are translated
from the functional currency to the Group’s reporting currency, Swedish kronor, at the exchange rate on
balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated at the average rate, which serves as an
approximation of the rate that applied on each transaction date. Translation differences arise in the
translation of subsidiary accounts in part because the balance sheet date rate changes each period and
in part because the average rate deviates from balance sheet date rate. Translation differences are
recognized directly in total comprehensive income as the year’s change in the translation reserve.

Long-term receivables and liabilities between the Parent Company and subsidiaries can be seen as an
extension or reduction of the net investment in each company. Such translation differences are
therefore recognized in the consolidated financial statements in total comprehensive income.

When foreign operations are sold, accumulated translation differences attributable to those operations
are realized.

During the year the Group did not hedge any other flow exposure pertaining to anticipated receipts or
disbursements in foreign currency.

**Financial assets and liabilities**
The Group applies _IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, IAS 39 Financial Instruments:_
_Recognition and Measurement, IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and IFRS 13 Fair Value_
_Measurement._


-----

A financial instrument is defined as any form of agreement giving rise to a financial asset in a company
and a financial liability or equity instrument in a counterparty.

Financial instruments recognized in the balance sheet include, on the asset side, cash and bank
balances, accounts receivable and other equity instruments, loans receivable, purchased debt and
derivatives. Client funds are recognized on a separate line in the balance sheet and therefore are not
included in the Group’s reported liquid assets. Included among liabilities and equity are accounts
payable, client funds payable, debt and equity instruments in issue, loan liabilities and derivatives.

Financial instruments are initially recognized at cost, corresponding to the instrument’s fair value plus
transaction expenses. Exceptions are financial instruments categorized as financial assets or liabilities
recognized at fair value in income statement, which are recognized at fair value excluding transaction
costs. Measurement depends on how they are classified, as indicated below.

A financial asset or financial liability is recognized in the balance sheet when the company becomes
party to the instrument’s contractual terms. Receivables are recognized when the company has
performed and there is a contractual obligation on the counterparty to pay, even if an invoice has not
yet been received. Accounts receivable are recognized in the balance sheet when an invoice has been
sent. Liabilities are recognized when the counterparty has performed and there is a contractual
obligation to pay, even if an invoice has not yet been received. Accounts payable are recognized when
an invoice is received.

A financial asset is removed from the balance sheet when the rights in the agreement are realized,
expire or the company loses control over them. A financial liability is removed from the balance sheet
when the obligation in the agreement has been discharged or otherwise extinguished.

The fair value of listed financial assets corresponds to their listed market price on the balance sheet
date. The fair value of unlisted financial assets is determined by using valuation techniques, e.g.,
recently conducted transactions, the price of similar instruments and discounted cash flows. For forward
exchange contracts and currency interest rate swaps, fair value is determined based on listed prices.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts and currency interest rate swaps is calculated by
discounting the difference between the contracted forward rate and the forward rate that can be secured
on the balance sheet date for the remaining contract period. The current value is obtained by
discounting applying the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. For further information, see Note 34.

**_Purchased debt_**
Purchased debt consists of portfolios of delinquent consumer debts purchased at prices significantly
below the nominal receivable. They are recognized according to the rules for loans and receivables in
IAS 39, i.e., at amortized cost according to the effective interest model.

Income from purchased debt is recognized in the income statement as the collected amount less
amortization. The collection is performed by the same personnel who handle collections and debt
surveillance on behalf of external clients within the Credit Management service line. The cost of
collection is debited internally at market price and expensed in the income statement for the Purchased
Debt service line as a cost of services sold.

Reporting follows the effective interest method, where the carrying value of each portfolio corresponds
to the present value of all projected future cash flows discounted by an initial effective interest rate
determined on the date the portfolio was acquired, based on the relation between cost and the
projected future cash flows on the acquisition date. Changes in the carrying value of the portfolios are
comprised of amortization for the period and are recognized in the income statement on the revenue
line.

In connection with the purchase of each portfolio of receivables, a projection is made of the portfolio’s
cash flows. Cash flows include the loan amount, reminder fees, collection fees and late interest that,
based on a probability assessment, are expected to be received from debtors, less forecast collection
costs. With this projection and the purchase price including transaction costs as a basis, each portfolio
is assigned an initial effective interest rate that is then used to discount cash flows through the life of
the portfolio. Current cash flow projections are monitored over the course of the year and updated
based on, among other things, achieved collection results, agreements reached with debtors on
installment plans and macroeconomic information. Cash flow projections are made at the portfolio level,


-----

since each portfolio of receivables consists of a small number of homogeneous amounts. On the basis
of the updated cash flow projections and initial effective interest rate, a new carrying value for the
portfolio is calculated in the closing accounts.

The Group applies internal application rules which mean that the initial effective interest rate can be
adjusted in certain cases without a change in the carrying value of the portfolio for minor projection
adjustments within a predetermined interval.

Changes over time in the book value can be divided into a time and interest rate component and a
component related to changes in estimates of future cash flows. The effects of changes in cash flow
forecasts are referred to as revaluations and treated symmetrically, i.e., both increases and decreases
in forecast flows affect the portfolios’ book value and, as a result, earnings. However, the portfolios are
never recognized at higher than cost.

**_Long-term receivables and other receivables_**
Long-term receivables and other receivables are those that arise when the company provides money
without the intent to trade its claim. If the anticipated maturity is longer than one year they constitute
long-term receivables, and if it is shorter they are other receivables. These receivables fall into the
category Loans and accounts receivable and are assessed at their discounted current value if their
expected maturity exceeds 12 months. If their maturities are shorter, they are assessed at accrued cost.

**_Accounts receivable_**
Accounts receivable are classified in the category loans and receivables. Accounts receivable are
recognized at the amount expected to be received after deducting impaired receivables, which are
determined individually or according to statistical models based on historical experience in each
country. Impairment needs are addressed when receivables have fallen overdue for payment by a
certain number of days, which differs between countries, or if Intrum Justitia becomes aware that the
counterparty has become insolvent. Provisions for impaired receivables are recognized as sales and
marketing expenses. The anticipated maturity of accounts receivable is short, so they are carried at
accrued cost without discounting.

**_Factoring Receivables_**
Receivables acquired in the Group’s factoring operations are recognized at accrued costs, ie the
discounted present value of contractual future payments, less a provision for credit losses. Provisions
for credit losses are made for overdue factoring receivables, using different percentages depending on
how long the receivables have been past due date.

**_Legal outlays_**
The Group incurs outlays for court fees, legal representation, enforcement authorities, etc., which can
be charged to and collected from debtors. In certain cases Intrum Justitia has agreements with its
clients where any expenses that cannot be collected from debtors are instead refunded by the client.
The amount that is expected to be recovered from a solvent counterparty is recognized as an asset in
the balance sheet on the line Other receivables. The anticipated maturity of these receivable is short,
so they are carried at accrued cost without discounting.

**_Client funds_**
Client funds, which are reported as assets and liabilities in the balance sheet, represent cash received
on collection of a specific debt on behalf of a client and payable to the client within a specified period.
Client funds are liquid funds with a restricted disposition right. The same amount is reported as a
liability.

**_Liquid assets_**
Liquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents as well as immediately available balances with
banks and similar institutions. Short-term investments consist of investments with an insignificant risk
of fluctuating in value, which can easily be converted to cash and have a maturity of not more than three
months from acquisition.


-----

**_Liabilities_**
Liabilities are classified as other financial liabilities, which means that they are initially recognized at the
amount received after deducting transaction expenses. Subsequent to acquisition, loans are carried at
amortized cost according to the effective rate method. Long-term liabilities have an anticipated maturity
of more than one year, while short-term liabilities have a maturity of less than one year. The Group’s
long-term loans generally have short fixed-interest periods, which means that the nominal loan amount
plus accrued interest is a good approximation of the liability calculated according to the effective rate
model.

**_Accounts payable_**
Accounts payable are classified in the category other financial liabilities. Accounts payable have a short
anticipated maturity and are carried without discounting at nominal amount.

**_Derivatives_**
Derivatives consist of forward exchange contracts and currency interest rate swaps used to reduce
exchange rate risks attributable to assets and liabilities in foreign currency. Derivatives are also
contractual terms embedded in other agreements. Embedded derivatives are recognized separately if
they are not closely related to the host agreement.

Forward exchange contracts are classified as financial assets or liabilities recognized at fair value via
the income statement (held for trade) and assessed at fair value without deductions for transaction
expenses that may arise on sale or similar.

Hedge accounting is not needed for forward exchange contracts because the hedged item and the
hedging instrument are carried at fair value with changes in value recognized in the income statement
as exchange rate differences. Changes in the value of operations-related receivables and liabilities are
recognized in operating earnings, while changes in the value of financial receivables and liabilities are
recognized in net financial items.

Currency interest rate swaps are valued at fair value and reported in the balance sheet together with
hedge accounting via Other comprehensive income. Currency interest rate swaps were signed in
connection with the Parent Company’s issue of bonds in SEK that were exchanged for EUR to hedge
net investments in foreign operations where the loan currency has been used in the operations. The
liability in SEK was exchanged into the same liability in EUR on both the starting date and the date of
maturity.

_Hedge accounting with regard to exchange rate risk in the net investment in foreign subsidiaries_
Investments in foreign subsidiaries (net assets including goodwill) are to some extent hedged through
loans in foreign currency or forward exchange contracts that are translated on the closing date to the
exchange rate then in effect. Translation differences for the period on financial instruments used to
hedge a net investment in a Group company are recognized in the degree the hedge is effective in total
comprehensive income, while cumulative changes are recognized in equity (translation reserve). As a
result, translation differences that arise when Group companies are consolidated are neutralized.

**Intangible fixed assets**
**_Goodwill_**
Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of an acquisition and the fair value of the acquired
assets, assumed liabilities and contingent liabilities.

If the Group’s cost of the acquired shares in a subsidiary exceeds the market value of the subsidiary’s
net assets according to the acquisition analysis, the difference is recognized as Group goodwill. The
goodwill that can arise through business combinations implemented through other than a purchase of
shares is recognized in the same way.

For business combinations where the cost is less than the net value of acquired assets and assumed
and contingent liabilities, the difference is recognized directly through the income statement.

Goodwill is recognized at cost less accumulated impairment. The fair value of goodwill is determined
annually for each cash-generating unit in relation to the unit’s performance and anticipated future cash


-----

flow. If deemed necessary, goodwill is written down on the basis of this evaluation. Intrum Justitia’s
operations in each geographical region (Northern Europe, Central Europe and Western Europe) are
considered the Group’s cash-generating units in this regard.

Goodwill that arises from the acquisition of a company outside Sweden is classified as an asset in the
local currency and translated in the accounts at the balance sheet date rate.

**_Capitalized expenses for IT development_**
The Group applies IAS 38 Intangible assets.

Expenditures for IT development and maintenance are generally expensed as incurred. Expenditures
for software development that can be attributed to identifiable assets under the Group’s control and with
anticipated future economic benefits are capitalized and recognized as intangible assets. These
capitalized costs include staff costs for the development team and other direct and indirect costs.
Borrowing costs are included in the cost of qualified fixed assets.

Additional expenditures for previously developed software, etc. are recognized as an asset in the
balance sheet if they increase the future economic benefits of the specific asset to which they are
attributable, e.g., by improving or extending a computer program’s functionality beyond its original use
and estimated useful life.

IT development costs that are recognized as intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line
method over their useful lives (3–5 years). Useful life is reassessed annually. The asset is recognized
at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment.

Costs associated with the maintenance of existing computer software are expensed as incurred.

**_Client relationships_**
Client relationships that are recognized as fixed assets relate to fair value revaluations recognized upon
acquisition in accordance with IFRS 3. They are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated
period of use (5–10 years). Useful life is reassessed annually. The asset is recognized at cost less
accumulated amortization and impairment.

_Other intangible fixed assets_
Other intangible fixed assets relate to other acquired rights are amortized on a straight-line basis over
their estimated period of use (3–5 years). Useful life is reassessed annually. The asset is recognized at
cost less accumulated amortization and impairment.

**Tangible fixed assets**
The Group applies IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment.

Tangible fixed assets are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Cost
includes the purchase price and costs directly attributable to putting the asset into place and condition
to be utilized in the way intended. Examples of directly attributable costs are delivery and handling,
installation, consulting services and legal services. Depreciation is booked on a straight-line basis over
the asset’s anticipated useful life (3–5 years). Useful life is reassessed annually.

The carrying value of a tangible fixed asset is excluded from the balance sheet when the asset is sold
or disposed of or when no economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal of the asset. The
gain or loss that arises on the sale or disposal of an asset is comprised of the difference between the
sales price and the asset’s carrying value less direct costs to sell. Gains and losses are recognized as
other operating earnings. An annual determination is made of each asset’s residual value and a period
of use.

Tangible fixed assets are recognized as an asset in the balance sheet if it is likely that the future
economic benefits will accrue to the company and the cost of the asset can be reliably estimated.


-----

**Leasing**
The Group applies IAS 17 Leases. Leasing is classified in the consolidated accounts as either finance
or operating leasing.

When a lease means that the Group, as lessee, essentially enjoys the economic benefits and bears the
economic risks attributable to the leased asset, it is classified as a finance lease. The leased asset is
recognized in the balance sheet as a fixed asset, while the estimated present value of future lease
payments is recognized as a liability. The portion of the lease fee that falls due for payment within one
year is recognized as a current liability, while the remainder is recognized as a long-term liability.
Minimum lease fees for finance leases are divided between interest expense and amortization of the
outstanding liability. Interest expense is divided over the lease term so that each reporting period is
charged with an amount corresponding to a fixed interest rate for the liability recognized in each period.
Variable fees are expensed in the period in which they arise.

In operating leasing, lease payments are expensed over the lease term. Payments are recognized in
the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Benefits received in connection with
the signing of an operating lease are recognized as part of the total lease expense in the income
statement.

**Taxes**
The Group applies IAS 12 Income taxes.

Income taxes consist of current tax and deferred tax. Income taxes are recognized in the income
statement unless the underlying transaction is recognized directly in other total comprehensive income,
in which case the related tax effect is recognized in other total comprehensive income.

Current tax is tax that is to be paid or received during the year in question applying the tax rates
applicable on the balance sheet date; which includes adjustment of current tax attributable to previous
periods.

Deferred tax is calculated according to the balance sheet method based on temporary differences
between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their value for tax purposes. The following
temporary differences are not taken into account: temporary differences that arise in the initial reporting
of goodwill, the initial reporting of assets and liabilities in a transaction other than a business
combination and which, at the time of the transaction, do not affect either the recognized or taxable
result, or temporary differences attributable to participations in subsidiaries and associated companies
that are not expected to be reversed within the foreseeable future. The valuation of deferred tax is
based on how the carrying values of assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. Deferred
tax is calculated by applying the tax rates and tax rules that have been set or essentially are set as of
the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax assets from deductible temporary differences and tax-loss carryforwards are only
recognized if it is likely they will be utilized within the foreseeable future. The value of deferred tax
assets is reduced when it is no longer considered likely they can be utilized.

**Shareholders’ equity**
Share repurchases and transaction expenses are recognized directly against equity. Dividends are
recognized as a liability after they are approved by the Annual General Meeting.

**Provisions**
The Group applies IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.

A provision is recognized in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or informal obligation owing
to an event that has occurred and it is likely that an outflow of economic resources will be required to
settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. The carrying amount for the
provision is based on an assessment of the most likely outcome, and can be calculated by weighing the
various possible outcomes and multiplying this by their estimated probability. Where it is important when
in time payment will be made, provisions are estimated by discounting the projected future cash flow at
a pretax interest rate that reflects current market estimates of the time value of money and, where
appropriate, the risks associated with the liability.


-----

A provision for restructuring is recognized when a detailed, formal restructuring plan has been
established and the restructuring has either begun or been publicly announced. No provision is made
for future operating expenses.

A provision for termination costs is recognized only if the persons in question have known or presumed
to have expected to be terminated by the balance sheet date.

A provision is recognized for an onerous contract when anticipated benefits that the Group expects to
receive from a contract are less than the unavoidable costs to fulfill the obligations as set out in the
contract.

A provision for dilapidation agreements on leased premises is recognized if there is a contractual
obligation to the landlord, within the foreseeable future, to restore the premises to a certain condition
when the lease expires.

**Unidentified receipts and excess payments**
The Group receives large volumes of payments from debtors for itself and its clients. There are
instances where the sender’s reference information is missing or incorrect, which makes it difficult to
allocate the payment to the right case. There are also situations where payments are received on
closed cases. In such instances a reasonable search and attempt is made to contact the payment
sender but, failing this, the payment is recognized as income after a certain interval. A provision is
recognized in the balance sheet corresponding to the anticipated repayments of incorrectly received
payments on a probability analysis.

**Contingent liabilities**
A contingent liability is recognized when there is a possible obligation that arises from past events
whose existence will be confirmed only by one or more uncertain future events or when there is an
obligation that is not recognized as a liability or provision because it is not probable that an outflow of
resources will be required.

**Impairment**
The Group applies IAS 36 Impairment of assets.

The carrying value of the Group’s assets, with certain exceptions, is tested on each balance sheet date
for any indication of impairment. IAS 36 is applied to impairment testing of all assets with the exception
of financial assets, which are valued according to IAS 39, investment assets for pension liabilities, which
are valued according to IAS 19 Employee Benefits, and tax assets, which are valued according to
IAS 12 Income Taxes.

If there is any indication of impairment, the asset’s recoverable value is estimated. For goodwill and
other intangible assets with an indeterminate useful life and intangible assets not yet brought into use,
recoverable values are calculated annually. If essentially independent cash flows cannot be isolated for
individual assets, the assets are grouped at the lowest level where essentially independent cash flows
can be identified, i.e., a cash-generating unit. Intrum Justitia’s operations in each geographical region
are considered to be the Group’s cash-generating units in this regard. Impairment is recognized when
the carrying value of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable value. Impairment is
recognized in the income statement. Impairment attributable to a cash-generating unit is mainly
allocated to goodwill, after which they are divided proportionately among other assets in the unit. The
recoverable amount of cash-generating units is the higher of their fair value less costs to sell and value
in use. Value in use is measured by discounting future cash flows using a discounting factor that takes
into account the risk-free rate of interest and the risk associated with the specific asset.

Impairment of goodwill is not reversed. Impairment of other assets is reversed if a change has been
made in the assumptions that served as the basis for determining the recoverable amount. Impairment
is reversed only to the extent the carrying value of the assets following the reversal does not exceed
the carrying value that the asset would have had if the impairment had not been recognized.

**Employee benefits**
The Group applies IAS 19 Employee Benefits.

**_Pension obligations_**
The Group’s pension obligations are, for the most part, secured through official pension arrangements
or insurance solutions. Pension obligations vary between countries on the basis of legislation and
different pension systems. See also Note 21 for a further description.

Defined contribution pension plans are plans where the company’s obligation is limited to the fees it has
committed to pay. The size of the employee’s pension depends in part on the fees the company pays
to an insurance company and in part on the return generated and actuarial factors. Consequently, it is
the employee who assumes the investment risk and actuarial risk. The company’s obligations for
defined contribution pension plans are expensed through the income statement as they are vested by
employees who render services on behalf of the company.

For defined benefit pension plans, the pension obligation does not cease until the agreed pensions
have been paid. The Group’s net obligation for defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately
for each plan by estimating future compensation the employees have earned in current and previous
periods; this compensation is discounted to its present value. The discount rate is the interest rate as
per the balance sheet date on high-quality corporate bonds, including housing bonds, with a maturity
that, if possible, corresponds to the Group’s pension obligations. The calculation is performed by an
actuary using the so-called Projected Unit Credit Method. The fair value of Intrum Justitia’s share of any
investment assets as of the balance sheet date is calculated as well.

Actuarial gains and losses may arise in the determination of the present value of the obligation and the
fair value of investment assets. They arise either because the actual outcome deviates from previous
assumptions or the assumptions change. All changes in value associated with such changes in
assumptions are recognized in other comprehensive income.

The balance sheet value of pensions and similar obligations is therefore equivalent to the present value
on the balance sheet date less the fair value of assets under management.

Pension costs for service in the current period are reported in the operating result, while the calculated
interest expense on the pension liability and the interest income from assets under management are
reported in net financial items.

Pension obligations in Sweden that are met through pension insurance premiums to Alecta in the socalled ITP 2 plan are reported as defined contribution pension solutions.

**Borrowing costs**
The Group applies _IAS 23 Borrowing costs_ and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and
_Measurement._

Costs to secure bank financing are amortized across the term of the loan as financial expenses in the
consolidated income statement. The amount is recognized in the balance sheet as a deduction to the
loan liability.

The Group capitalizes borrowing costs in the cost of qualifying assets, that is, fixed assets for
substantial amounts with long periods of completion. No such investments were initiated in 2014 or
2015.

**Income recognition**
The Group applies IAS 18 Revenue.

Income, consisting of commissions and collection fees is recognized on collection of the debt.
Subscription income is recognized proportionately over the term of the underlying service contracts,
which is usually one year.


-----

**Financial income and expenses**
Financial income and expenses consist of interest income on bank balances and receivables and
interest-bearing securities, bank fees, interest expenses on loans, dividend income, exchange rate
differences, realized and unrealized gains on financial investments, and derivatives used in financial
operations. The net interest income attributable to the Group’s factoring operations are recognized in
net revenues.

**Payment guarantees**
Intrum Justitia offers some of the Group’s clients the opportunity, against payment, to obtain a
guarantee from Intrum Justitia regarding the clients’ receivables from their customers. The guarantee
entails an undertaking by Intrum Justitia to acquire the receivable from the creditor at its nominal value,
or a certain part thereof, once it has fallen overdue for payment by a certain number of days. The
income, in the form of a guarantee fee, is recognized when the guarantees are issued, while a liability
is recognized in the balance sheet for expected losses related to those guarantees. If the debtor fails
to make payment, Intrum Justitia acquires the claim. The disbursement is then recognized as an
acquisition of a receivable, less the liability recognized when the guarantee was issued.

**Cash flow statement**
The Group applies IAS 7 Cash flow statements.

The cash flow statement includes changes in the balance of liquid assets. The Group’s liquid assets
consist of cash and bank balances. Cash flow is divided into cash flows from operating activities,
investing activities and financing activities.

Cash flow from investing activities includes only actual disbursements for investments during the year.

Payments for investments in portfolios of Purchased Debt are accounted for under cash flow from
investing activities, whereas collections and amortizations on such portfolios are accounted for under
cash flow from operating activities.

Foreign subsidiaries’ transactions are translated in the cash flow statement at the average exchange
rate for the period. Acquired and divested subsidiaries are recognized as cash flow from investing
activities, net, after deducting liquid assets in the acquired or divested company.

At an acquisition of a subsidiary that holds a portfolio of purchased debt, the fair value of the receivables
on the acquisition date is reported on the line Debt Purchases in the consolidated cash-flow statement.

**Earnings per share**
The Group applies IAS 33 Earnings per share.

Earnings per share consist of net earnings for the year (attributable to the Parent Company’s
shareholders) divided by a weighted average number of outstanding shares during the year. In this
context, treasury holdings of repurchased shares are not included in outstanding shares.

**Segments**
The Group applies IFRS 8 Operating Segments.

An operating segment is a part of the Group from which it can generate income and incur expenses and
for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating
decision maker, i.e. the CEO, in deciding how to assess performance and allocate resources to the
operating segment.

Intrum Justitia’s operating segments are the geographical regions Northern Europe (Denmark, Estonia,
Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Sweden), Central Europe (Austria, Czech Republic,
Germany, Hungary, Slovakia and Switzerland) and Western Europe (Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy,
Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom). Central and joint expenses are spread across the
geographical regions in proportion to their purchasing power parity-adjusted revenues. The break-down
by geographical region is also used for internal monitoring in the Group.


-----

Among other things, Note 2 details net revenue and operating earnings by geographic region. However,
interest income and expenses are not reported by segment. This is not considered relevant because
the distribution of financial items is dependent on Group structure and financing and is not affected by
the actual performance of the regions. Nor are actual reported interest income and expenses by
segment included in any internal reporting to the CEO.

**Parent Company’s accounting principles**
The Parent Company has prepared the annual report according to the Annual Accounts Act (1995:1554)
and recommendation RFR 2 Accounting for Legal Entities from the Swedish Financial Reporting Board.
RFR 2 means that the Parent Company, in the annual report for the legal entity, must apply all EUapproved IFRS and statements as far as possible within the framework of the Annual Accounts Act and
taking into account the connection between reporting and taxation. The recommendation specifies
exemptions and additions relative to IFRS.

**_Differences between the Group’s and Parent Company’s accounting principles_**
Differences between the Group’s and Parent Company’s accounting principles are indicated below. The
accounting principles for the Parent Company as stated below have been applied consistently to all
periods presented in the Parent Company’s financial statements.

**_Subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures_**
Shares in subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures are recognized by the Parent
Company at cost, including transaction costs less any impairment. Only dividends are recognized as
income.

**_Group contributions and shareholders’ contributions for legal entities_**
The company reports Group contributions and shareholders’ contributions in accordance with
statement UFR 2 of the Swedish Financial Reporting Board.

Group contributions received are recognized as dividends and Group contributions paid are recognized
as shareholders’ contributions. Shareholders’ contributions are recognized directly in the shareholders’
equity of the recipient and capitalized in the shares and participating interests of the contributor, to the
extent impairment is not required.

**_Other_**
The Parent Company has no leases classified as finance leases in its own accounts or the consolidated
accounts.

No individual client generates more than two percent of the Group’s total revenues.

The distribution of revenues and earnings by geographical region is based on where clients are located.

The geographical regions include Northern Europe (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, the Netherlands,
Norway, Poland and Sweden); Central Europe (Switzerland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Germany,
Hungary and Austria) and Western Europe (Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the UK).
Central and joint expenses are spread across the geographical regions in proportion to their purchasing
power parity-adjusted revenues. The break-down by geographical region is also used for internal
monitoring in the Group.

Intra-Group sales between the regions are made on commercial terms.

Internal transactions between the business areas Financial Services and Credit Management Services
relate to payment on commercial terms for work carried out within Credit Management regarding
handling and collection of the Group’s purchased debt. Payment is made in the form of a commission
that is recognized as a cost within Financial Services, but which is eliminated in the Consolidated
Income Statement.

Interest income and expenses are not reported by segment. This is not considered relevant because
the distribution of financial items is dependent on Group structure and financing and is not affected by
the actual performance of the regions. Nor are actual reported interest income and expenses by
segment included in any internal reporting to the CEO.

The operating earnings include interest income attributable to purchased debt amounting to
SEK 2,276 M (2,039), defined as the difference between the year’s collected amount and amortization
for the year. Amortization comprises the portion of the cost of the portfolio that, owing to allocation under
the effective interest method, accrues over the current year.

The item Dividends from Group companies includes Group contributions received from subsidiaries in
Sweden in the amount of SEK 221 M (303), and an anticipated dividend from the subsidiary, Intrum
Justitia International AB of SEK 1,000 M (0).

During the year, no taxes were recognized for discontinued operations, not for capital gains.

The Group has operations in some 20 countries in Europe, with various tax rates. The current tax
expense for the year mainly relates to income taxes in Switzerland, France, Sweden, Norway, Finland

and the Czech Republic. However, several of the Group’s Swedish companies paid no income tax for
the relevant year as they were able to utilize taxloss carryforwards from historic losses.

Intrum Justitia AB is domiciled in Sweden where the nominal corporate tax rate in 2014 and 2015 was
22 percent. The following reconciliation explains the difference between the Group’s actual tax cost and
the expected tax cost taking the Swedish corporate tax rate into account:

Unrecognized tax assets regarding tax-loss carryforwards relate to the negative tax effect during the
year attributable to losses in countries where no deferred tax asset is recognized because it is not
sufficiently probable that enough taxable profit will arise within the foreseeable future. Utilized
previously unrecognized tax assets pertaining to tax-loss carryforwards relate to the positive tax effect
over the year arising through the utilization of tax-loss carryforwards never previously recognized as
deferred tax assets. Adjustments for previous years and other items include resolved tax disputes
in 2014.

Tax-exempt income and non-deductible expenses in the Parent Company consist primarily of dividends
from subsidiaries, impairment of shares in connection with shareholder contributions, as well as
impairment in 2014 of shares in subsidiaries. For 2014, Adjustments to previous years and other
concerns a tax surcharge paid that related to the 2009 income year. The Parent Company has
accumulated tax-loss carryforwards of SEK 852 M (1,037) at year-end as a result of both income items
and unrealized translation differences recognized in other comprehensive income.

When differences arise between the tax value and carrying value of assets and liabilities, a deferred tax
asset or tax liability is recognized. Such temporary differences mainly arise for purchased debt,
provisions for pensions and intangible assets. Deferred tax assets include the value of tax-loss
carryforwards in the instances where they are likely to be utilized to offset taxable surpluses within the
foreseeable future.

The deferred tax assets and income tax liabilities are expected to be due for payment in over one year.

The Group has tax-loss carryforwards that can be utilized against future earnings totaling SEK 1,731 M
(1,776). In the calculation of deferred tax liabilities attributable to temporary differences in the
recognition of purchased receivables, however, SEK 94 M (102) has been subtracted, corresponding to
a cautiously calculated option to offset the deferred tax liabilities against tax losses in the same country.

Tax-loss carryforwards in countries with maturities for the utilization of those carryforwards relate to
Poland with SEK 5 M (48), the Netherlands with SEK 150 M (50) and Slovakia with SEK 4 M (3). In
Poland, the tax-loss carryforwards can be utilized only for a period of five years from the year of the
loss, in the Netherlands for nine years and in Slovakia for four years. No deferred tax assets are
recognized for the tax-loss carryforwards in these three countries.

Loss carryforwards for which no deferred tax assets are recognized pertain mainly to Sweden with
SEK 852 M (1,037) and the UK with SEK 381 M (371). Most of the tax-loss carryforwards in Sweden
consist of the deficit in the Parent Company. As a consequence of the costs for the head office
expenses and financing costs, the Parent Company has for several years incurred a tax deficit, even
when taking in to account the group contributions received from the profitable companies conducting
business in Sweden. It is Intrum Justitia’s assessment that tax-loss carryforwards cannot be utilized
against positive taxable income in the foreseeable future without first restructuring the Group internally
so that, for example, the Parent Company’s interest expenses are transferred to foreign subsidiaries. If
and when such restructuring is implemented, it may be relevant to evaluate the tax-loss carryforwards
in the accounts. Because the tax-loss carryforwards exist in the Parent Company, they are not involved
in the impairment testing of goodwill that pertains to the business of the subsidiaries. Loss
carryforwards in Sweden may also be consumed through so-called CFC taxation on the earnings of
foreign subsidiaries with revenues subject to low tax rates.

Tax expenses recognized in other comprehensive income over the year amounted to SEK 8 M (28).
No tax has been recognized directly against equity.

In accordance with the Board’s proposal, the 2014 and 2015 Annual General Meetings resolved to
authorize the Board, in the period until the relevant subsequent AGM, to acquire and transfer the

company’s own shares on the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange. The company’s holding of treasury shares
may not at any time exceed 10 percent of the total number of shares in the company. Over the year,
1,499,808 shares (4,699,344) shares were repurchased in accordance with decisions by the Board of
Directors for SEK 400 M (968).

Payments during the year regarding investments in intangible fixed assets amounted to SEK 105 M (90)
for the Group.

Capitalized expenditure for IT development is mainly generated internally using our own employees
and/or contracted consultants. Client relations and goodwill are acquired in connection with business
acquisitions. Other intangible fixed assets are mainly acquired externally.

**Impairment testing for cash-generating units containing goodwill**
In 2015, the Group treated the following geographical regions as cashgenerating units in the sense
referred to in IAS 36 Impairment of assets.

The carrying amounts for goodwill are distributed among the regions as follows:

**SEKm                                                                           2015            2014**

Impairment testing of goodwill for each cash-generating unit was done prior to preparation of the annual
accounts. The recoverable amount is determined through an estimation of its value in use. For each
cash-generating unit, management has compiled a projection of annual future cash flows based on
historical experience and the company’s own plans and estimates for the future. The calculation is
based on a detailed forecast for the years 2016–2018 and thereafter an annual increase of 1 percent.
The cash flows have been discounted to present value applying the Group’s weighted average cost of
capital, which is estimated at 6.5 percent (8.0) per year before tax, corresponding to 5.2 percent (6.2)
per year after tax. The recoverable amount has been compared for each unit with the Group’s net book
value of the unit’s assets and liabilities. The test gave no indication of a need of goodwill impairment.

Impairment testing is based on a number of assumptions, where the outcome is judged to be most
sensitive to some of those assumptions in particular:

For 2017, annual revenue growth of 4 percent (10) is assumed, and for 2018, 2 percent (10), with each
SEK 1,000 in increased revenue being assumed to result in an increase in working capital of SEK 250
(300), that is, an “incremental increase in earnings” of 25 percent (30). For the period after 2018,
perpetual growth in cash flow of 2 percent (3) annually is assumed. The same assumptions were
applied for all three geographical regions. The same discount rates were also applied, since no
long-term difference can be identified between the regions’ growth potential or risk.


-----

**Sensitivity analysis**
A sensitivity analysis has been performed, in which cash flows have been discounted at 8 percent
interest after tax and an eternal growth of only 1 percent was assumed. Even with these assumptions,
the impairment testing did not indicate any need to recognize impairment in goodwill for any of the three
regions.

A VAT receivable is incurred in the Netherlands when purchasing overdue receivables. The VAT portion
of the receivable can be recovered from the tax authorities if it is not collected from the debtor and is
therefore recognized as a separate receivable. The portion that is expected to be recovered within
twelve months is recognized as current.

In the Netherlands, bailiffs are private companies and expenses for collection cases paid to them can
sometimes be recovered from the bailiffs if their collection measures fail. When it emerges that Intrum
Justitia is entitled to request that the amount be returned from the enforcement authorities, the amount
is moved from Outlays on behalf of clients, to To recover from enforcement authorities.

**20   Shareholders’ equity**
**Share capital**
According to the Articles of Association of Intrum Justitia AB (publ), the company’s share capital will
amount to not less than SEK 1,300,000 and not more than SEK 5,200,000. All shares are fully paid in,
carry equal voting rights and share equally in the company’s assets and earnings. No shares are
reserved for transfer.

There are 73,421,328 shares in the company, and the share capital amounts to SEK 1,594,893.02.

**Share repurchase**
During the year 1,499,808 shares were repurchased (4,699,344) for SEK 400 M (968). The amount for
the repurchased shares is recognized as a reduction of retained earnings. The Board’s intention is to
reduce the share capital by canceling the shares that are repurchased. In accordance with the
resolution by the Annual General Meeting in April 2015, the 3,939,616 shares repurchased between
January 2014 and March 2015 were canceled and the number of registered shares in the company fell
from 77,360,944 to 73,421,328. The share capital was reduced by SEK 81,220, but was immediately
restored through a bonus issue and transfer from retained earnings.

The 1,073,602 shares repurchased in April-December 2015 represent the company’s treasury holding
as of the balance sheet date. Consequently, excluding treasury shares, 72,347,726 shares were
outstanding on the balance sheet date.

**Other shareholders’ equity in the Group**
**_Other paid-in capital_**
Refers to equity other than share capital contributed by the owners or arising owing to the Group’s
shared-based payment programs. Also included are share premiums paid in connection with new
issues.

**_Reserves_**
Includes the translation reserve, which contains all exchange rate differences that have, since the
transition to IFRS in 2004, arisen in the translation of financial statements from foreign operations as
well as long-term intra-Group receivables and liabilities that represent an increase or decrease in the
Group’s net investment in the foreign operations. The amount also includes exchange rate differences
arising in the Parent Company’s external loans in foreign currency, which are intended to hedge the
Group’s translation exposure attributable to net assets in foreign subsidiaries.


-----

**_Retained earnings including net earnings for the year_**
Refer to earnings in the Parent Company and subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated companies.
Provisions to the statutory reserve, excluding transferred share premium reserves, were previously
included in this item. Accumulated revaluations of the Group’s defined benefit pension provisions are
also included. Dividends paid and share repurchases are deducted from the amount.

Following the balance sheet date the Board of Directors proposed a dividend of SEK 8.25 per share
(7.00), or a total estimated payout of SEK 597 M (514), calculated on the number of shares outstanding,
excluding treasury holdings, as per December 31, 2015.

**Other shareholders’ equity in the Parent Company**
**_Statutory reserve_**
Refers to provisions to the statutory reserve and share premium reserve prior to 2006. The statutory
reserve is restricted equity and may not be reduced through distributions of earnings.

**_Share premium reserve_**
When shares are issued at a premium, the amount exceeding their quota value is transferred to the
share premium reserve. Provisions to the share premium reserve since 2006 are non-restricted equity.

**_Fair value reserve_**
Refers to unrealized exchange rate gains or losses on long-term monetary transactions with
subsidiaries as well as external loans in foreign currency, which are intended to hedge the Group’s
translation exposure attributable to net assets in foreign subsidiaries. The fair value reserve is
non-restricted equity.

**_Earnings brought forward_**
Refer to retained earnings from the previous year less the dividend paid and share repurchases.
Retained earnings are non-restricted equity.

**Capital structure**
The company’s definition of capital corresponds to shareholders’ equity including holdings without a
controlling interest, which at year-end totaled SEK 3,166 M (3,041).

The measure of the Group’s capital structure applied for control purposes is consolidated net debt
divided by earnings before interests, taxes, depreciation, amortization and Purchased Debt revaluations
(EBITDA).

Net debt is defined as the sum of interest-bearing liabilities and pension provisions less liquid funds and
interest-bearing receivables.

The Board has set financial targets for the Group whereby net debt divided by EBITDA, on a rolling
12-month basis, should be between 2.0 and 3.0.

On December 31, 2015, this key figure amounted to 1.8 (1.9), that is, lower than the targeted interval

**21   Pensions**
Employees in Intrum Justitia’s companies are covered by various pension benefits, some of which are
defined benefit plans and others defined contribution plans. The Group applies _IAS 19 Employee_
_Benefits, which contains, among other things, uniform regulations on the actuarial calculation of_
provisions for pensions in defined benefit plans.

Group employees in Norway and Switzerland are covered by pension plans funded through assets
under the management of insurance companies and are reported as defined benefit pension plans.
Employees in Germany are covered by an unfunded defined benefit pension plan that can be paid out
as a one-time sum or as monthly payments following retirement. In France and Italy, the company
makes provisions for one-time payments made to employees on retirement, and these provisions are
also reported according to the rules for defined benefit pension plans. In Belgium and Sweden, there


-----

are pension plans, funded through insurance, which theoretically should have been reported as defined
benefit plans, but which are recognized as defined contribution plans since the company lacks sufficient
data to report them as defined benefit plans. See also below regarding the ITP 2 plan.

Among other things, IAS 19 requires pension costs for service in the current period to be reported in
the operating earnings, while the calculated interest expense on the pension liability and the interest
income from assets under management are reported in net financial items. Actuarial revaluations are
recognized in other comprehensive income.

In calculating Provisions for pensions, the following assumptions are used:

**%                                                                             2015            2014**
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  ––––––––––––    ––––––––––––

Assumed rate of increase in compensation ...............................................     1.0–2.5       1.0–3.2
Assumed return on plan assets..................................................................     1.0–1.9       2.0–2.7
Assumed pension increases.......................................................................     0.0–3.0       0.0–3.0
Future adjustment to social security base..................................................   2.25–4.20       3.0–4.5

The Group also finances a number of defined contribution plans, the costs of which amounted to
SEK 89 M (89).

**Funded defined benefit pension plans**
For Group employees in Switzerland, commitments exist in the form of compulsory service pension
plans funded through insurance policies in the Swiss Life Collective BVG Foundation and in
Transparenta BVG Foundation. The funded commitments currently amount to SEK 268 M (202), and
the fair value of the assets under management is SEK 181 M (148). Consequently, the net pension
liability is SEK 87 M (54). The pension commitment is funded through insurance contracts. During the
year Intrum Justitia paid SEK 15 M (11) to the plan, while disbursements to retirees amounted to
SEK 32 M (39). In 2016 payments to the plan are estimated at SEK 14 M, with disbursements to retirees
of SEK 15 M. For these pension plans, a discount rate of 0.75 percent is applied. An increase/decrease
in the discount rate by 0.5 percentage points would entail the pension liability decreasing by
8.8 percent/increasing by 10.2 percent.

For the Group’s employees in Norway, there are commitments for a compulsory service pension, which
are secured through insurance with the insurance company Storebrand Livforsikring. The funded
commitments currently amount to SEK 70 M (68), and the fair value of the assets under management
is SEK 52 M (57). Consequently, the net pension liability is SEK 18 M (11). The pension commitment is
funded through insurance contracts. During the year Intrum Justitia paid SEK 1 M (1) to the plan, while
disbursements to retirees amounted to SEK 2 M (1). Even in 2016, payments to the plan are estimated
at SEK 1 M, with disbursements to retirees of SEK 1 M. For these pension plans, a discount rate of
1.9 percent is applied.

**ITP 2 plan**
The commitments for retirement and family pensions for the Group’s Swedish employees are secured
through insurance with Alecta according to the so-called ITP 2 plan. According to a statement from the
Swedish Financial Reporting Board, UFR 10, the ITP 2 plan is a multi-employer defined benefit plan.
For the fiscal year, Alecta’s clients have not been provided enough information to report the plan as
defined benefit. Nor is there a contractual agreement how surpluses and deficits in the plan are to be
distributed among plan participants. The ITP 2 plan secured through insurance with Alecta is therefore
reported by Intrum Justitia as if it were a defined contribution plan. At year-end Alecta’s surplus in the
form of the collective funding ratio amounted to 153 percent (143). The collective funding ratio consists
of the market value of Alecta’s assets as a percentage of the insurance obligations calculated according
to Alecta’s actuarial assumptions, which do not conform to IAS 19.

Under the provisions of the ITP 2 plan, measures must be taken if the funding ratio falls below
125 percent (for example, in connection with an increase in the price of the subscription) or exceed
155 percent (for example, in connection with a premium reduction).

Long-term provisions are expected to be settled later than in 2016.

These provisions relate to the costs of restoring the company’s former premises in the UK. Intrum

Intrum Justitia AB signed a three-year syndicated loan facility totaling SEK 7,500 M with Nordea Bank
AB and Swedbank on December 23, 2015, to replace the previous one from 2014. The loan limit of
SEK 7,500 M can be utilized for borrowing in a number of different currencies.

During 2015, Intrum Justitia AB issued no bonds under the Company’s MTN program, compared to
SEK 1,000 M in the preceding year.

On December 31, 2015, the loan framework had been utilized for loans in SEK totaling SEK 500 M (0),
in CHF totaling CHF 5 M (12), in EUR totaling EUR 115 M (75), in NOK totaling NOK 250 M (200) and
in PLN totaling PLN 240 M (330). The unutilized portion of the facilities amounted to
SEK 5,141 M (3,250).

The loan carries a variable interest rate based on the interbank rate in each currency, with a margin.
The loan facility contains a number of operations-related and financial covenants, including limits on
certain financial indicators. All such conditions were met throughout 2015 and on December 31, 2015.
In addition, the credit agreement includes covenants that may restrict, condition or prohibit the Group
from incurring additional debt, making acquisitions, disposing of assets, making capital and finance
lease expenditures, allowing assets to be encumbered, changing the scope of the Group’s business
and entering into a merger agreement.

In 2015, Intrum Justitia also issued a commercial paper that, at the end of the year, amounted to
SEK 635 M (728).

**Pledged assets**
Refers to deposits and restricted bank balances that can be claimed by clients, suppliers or authorities
in the event that Intrum Justitia were not to meet its contractual obligations.

**Payment guarantees**
The Group offers services whereby clients, against payment, obtain a guarantee from Intrum Justitia
regarding the clients’ receivables from their customers. This entails a risk being incurred that Intrum
Justitia must compensate the customer for the guaranteed amount in the event that the invoices are not
paid on time. In those cases where the guarantee comes into play, Intrum Justitia assumes the client’s
claim against its customer and takes over the continued handling of the case within the Purchased Debt
area of operations. The total guarantee at year-end amounted to SEK 230 M (1,961), of which
receivables overdue by more than 30 days amounted to SEK 99 M (63). The change compared to
previous year is attributable to changed volumes. Intrum Justitia’s risk in this business is managed
through strict credit limits and analyses of card applicants’ credit status. As of year-end Intrum Justitia
had allocated SEK 3 M (22) in the balance sheet to cover payments that may arise due to the
guarantee.

**Other**
When Intrum Justitia acquired the Dutch subsidiary Buckaroo BV in 2012, a potential additional
purchase consideration for the sellers was agreed upon, to be paid out based on the achieved earnings
in the company for the years 2012–2014. Additional purchase consideration has only partly been paid
out. One of the sellers sued Intrum Justitia and a few of its employees in 2015, demanding further
payments of additional purchase consideration. The demand is explained by an allegation that Intrum
Justitia’s behavior would have induced lower than expected earnings in Buckaroo, and thereby a lower
additional purchase consideration. Intrum Justitia contests all demands and has not posted any accrual
or provision for this dispute.

The Group is otherwise involved in legal actions in the normal course of business. In the opinion of the
Board, none of these disputes are expected to give rise to any significant cost.

-----

Salaries and other remuneration in the Group also include remuneration in forms other than cash
payments, such as a free or subsidized car, housing and meals. Parent Company figures strictly refer
to cash payments, however. For information on compensation to the Group’s senior executives, see
Note 28.

**28   Terms and conditions of employment for senior executives**
**Remuneration principles for senior executives**
The 2015 Annual General Meeting adopted the following principles of remuneration for senior
executives, the President and the members of the Group Management Team. The proposal has been
prepared by the Board and its Remuneration Committee. The guidelines contains among other:

**_Salary and remuneration philosophy_**
At Intrum Justitia, we depend on our people to deliver on our ambitious goals in challenging
environments. Our reward philosophy has as the purpose to ensure that they are rewarded for their
valuable contributions to our Company. It also drives and promotes the behaviors and performance that
best support our business strategy and ensures that we are able to attract the key talent we need to be
successful.

Remuneration in Intrum Justitia should reflect individual competence, responsibility and performance,
and it should be competitive in comparison to that of similar companies within similar industries in the
relevant geography. To ensure that we drive the right behaviors and focus our efforts in the right areas,
performance is measured against goals that are closely linked to our business strategy and our four
core values.

**_Short term incentive_**
Our short term incentive rewards the achievement of primarily financial business goals and drives short
term performance, and so it is set for one year at a time. The metrics are individually decided for each
senior executive, in order to reflect the business strategy and our key priorities. Financial metrics either
reflect business goals or enterprise value creation as described below. In addition, the short term
incentive allows for our total remuneration costs to vary based on both business and individual
performance.

The short term incentive pays out a maximum amount corresponding to 20 to 50 percent of annual base
salary.

The cost for short-term incentive awarded to the CEO and senior executives is estimated not to exceed
MSEK 12.2 excluding social charges during 2015.

**_Long-term incentive_**
Our long term incentive aligns the interests and perspectives of our senior executives with those of our
shareholders and creates a close commitment to the Company. It rewards long term value creation over
a period of 3 years, and lets our senior executives share in the success of the business. As we believe
it to be the best indicator of our Company’s long term success, we use growth in Earnings Per Share
(EPS) as the measurement of value created. Similarly to the short term incentive, it also allows for our
total remuneration costs to vary based on business performance.

The long term incentive can at maximum pay out an amount corresponding to 75 percent of annual
base salary for the CEO and 20 to 50 percent for other senior executives.

**_Shareholding guidelines_**
To further promote ownership behavior and the commitment among our senior executives, we have put
in place shareholding guidelines that directly link the individual wealth of senior executives to the
success of our business. The guideline means that each senior executive is asked to hold a percentage
of their gross base salary in Intrum Justitia shares, 100 percent for the CEO and 50 percent for other
senior executives. The shares are to be held for as long as the senior executives are employed in the
Company and members of the Group Management Team.


-----

2015 is the first year that the shareholding guidelines are in effect, and each senior executive will be
given an amount of time (to be individually agreed) to build up their holdings.

**_Miscellaneous_**
In case of termination of employment by Intrum Justitia, severance payments (if any) will not exceed
12 months’ base salary. There are deviations from this in a few existing employment agreements.

If unusual or special reasons are at hand in an individual case, the board reserves the possibility to
deviate from these principles.

**Role of the Remuneration Committee**
The Board of Directors has a Remuneration Committee whose task is to address the Group’s
remuneration issues on behalf of shareholders and the Board. The Remuneration Committee is
responsible for preparing the Group’s remuneration guidelines, which include general principles for how
salaries and other remunerations are determined, as well as addressing remuneration issues
concerning the CEO and Group Management. The Remuneration Committee comprises three Board
members. Since the 2015 Annual General Meeting, the Remuneration Committee has consisted of Lars
Lundquist (Chairman), Charlotte Strömberg and Magnus Yngen. The CEO and the company’s Chief
Human Resources Officer are co-opted to the committee’s meetings, though not when their own
remuneration is discussed.

**Terms of employment and remuneration of the CEO**
During 2015, Lars Wollung, CEO and President between January and October 2015, received
remuneration in accordance with the Group’s principles as detailed above. His fixed annual salary for
2015 amounted to SEK 5,650,000 (5,253,000). In addition, he had the opportunity to receive variable
compensation up to 200 percent of his base salary, 50 percent within the framework of the short-term
variable salary program and 150 percent within the framework of the long-term remuneration program
year 2013. In addition to his salary, the company paid pension contributions corresponding to
35 percent of his fixed annual salary. The pension policy is a defined contribution plan and the
retirement age is 65 years. He also had a company car in accordance with the Group’s car policy, as
well as subsidized meals under the same terms as other Group employees in Sweden.

Lars Wollung was required to give six months’ notice if he had chosen to leave the company and Intrum
Justitia was required to give him 12 months’ notice when terminating his employment. On termination
by the company, he was also entitled to severance pay equivalent to 12 months’ salary, which is
considered to be in accordance with the practice for CEOs employed by listed companies in
Scandinavia.

Lars Wollung left his position as President and CEO in early November 2015, in accordance with a
decision by the Board of Directors, and he thus receives salary during the period of notice as set out in
the employment agreement.

Against earnings for 2015 an accrual has been charged for costs related to future payments to Lars
Wollung of salary during the notice period and severance pay, totaling 11 MSEK, and 10 MSEK for
variable compensation. Furthermore, mainly social security expenses and pension payments for such
compensation are charged against the 2015 earnings in the amount of 9 MSEK. The accrual for variable
compensation is included in the table below as compensation vested in 2015.

**Terms of employment and remuneration for other members of Group Management**
During 2015, other members of Group Management also had benefit levels in accordance with the
Group’s principles as detailed described above. This includes their fixed annual salary and the
opportunity to receive variable remuneration of up to 100 percent of their annual salary, of which
50 percent was under the short-term remuneration program and 50 percent under the long-term
remuneration program. Pension benefits vary from country to country. In several cases, they are
included in monthly salaries. Pension policies are defined contribution plans, and the retirement age is
generally 65. Members of Group Management have company cars, in accordance with the Group’s car
policy. Smaller benefits also occur according to local practice, such as subsidized meals and travel. One
member of the Group Management enjoys free housing, since he moved to be able to take up his post.


-----

During the period November 2015–February 2016, the Group’s Chief Financial Officer, Erik Forsberg,
was the acting CEO and he received a salary supplement of SEK 300,000 in total during this period, in
addition to his regular monthly salary.

The notice of termination for members of Group Management Team varies from two to twelve months,
regardless of whether termination is initiated by the employee or the company.

**Remuneration for the year**
Other senior executives in the table are defined as members of Group Management (see pages 80–81)
other than the CEO. They amount to nine people.

Amounts given correspond to full compensation for the relevant year, including earned but not yet paid
variable remuneration for the relevant year. This entails, for example, that the variable remuneration
accrued and expensed by the company in 2014 was disbursed in 2015, while the variable remuneration
for 2015 was disbursed in 2016.

No share-based remunerations were paid in 2014 or 2015.

**Development of total remuneration over the last years**
As outlined above, we have currently assessed year-on-year EPS growth as the best indicator of the
long term value that we create for our shareholders, which is why our long term incentive program
generally rewards EPS growth as the key measurement.

Our short term incentive is measured mainly on financial goals that more closely align to our annual
business plans such as service line earnings, EBIT or EBIT after cost of capital. If we consistently
deliver on such goals, we are also creating value for our shareholders supporting the growth in EPS.

In 2014 and 2015, we have reported a strong EPS growth, and we have delivered solid and consistent
results relating to our short term financial goals. Reflecting the high value delivered for our shareholders
and following our EPS growth, the aggregate variable remuneration payouts for the CEO and
Executives have also grown during this period:

**2015** **2014** **2013** **2012**
–––––––      –––––––      –––––––      –––––––
Variable salary, kSEK ...................................   23,809       25,145       27,058      10,160

Change in EPS, year-on-year.......................     18%         31%         41%          6%

The total variable remuneration payout for 2014 and 2015 are lower than for 2013 as the number of
senior executives who were eligible for payouts in 2014 and 2015 was less, due to departures.

**Board of Directors**
In accordance with the Annual General Meeting’s resolution, total fees paid to Board members for the
year, including for committee work, amounted to SEK 3,605,000. Board fees are distributed between
Directors as determined by the AGM according to the proposal of the Nomination Committee. The
Directors have no pension benefits or severance agreements.

Lease costs for operating leases amounted to SEK 134 M (120) during the year, of which SEK 1 M (2)
in the Parent Company.

Operating leasing primarily refers to offices for the Group’s operations in its countries. No single lease
is of material significance to the Group in terms of amount.

The only financial instruments that are regularly restated at fair value are derivatives (forward exchange
contracts). They are valued based on a valuation technique that uses observable market data and thus
falls under Level 2 in the valuation hierarchy according to IFRS 13.

Financial assets include the balance sheet items: purchased debt, other long-term receivables,
accounts receivable, client funds, other current receivables, accrued income, derivatives with positive
value, cash and cash equivalents and, for the Parent Company, intra-Group receivables.

The total recognized value of consolidated financial assets amounted to SEK 8,757 M (8,091) on the
balance sheet date. Financial assets classified as loan receivables and accounts receivable amounted
to SEK 8,749 M (8,048) and financial assets recognized at fair value through profit and loss amounted
to SEK 8 M (43).

The total recognized value of the Parent Company’s financial assets amounted to SEK 6,977 M (4,846)
on the balance sheet date. Financial assets classified as loan receivables and accounts receivable
amounted to SEK 6,969 M (4,803) and financial assets recognized at fair value through profit and loss
amounted to SEK 8 M (43).

Financial liabilities include the balance sheet items: non-current and current liabilities to credit
institutions, bond loans, commercial papers, client funds payable, accounts payable, advances from
clients, other current liabilities, accrued expenses, prepaid income and, for the Parent Company,
intra-Group liabilities.

The total recognized value of consolidated financial assets amounted to SEK 8,110 M (7,592) on the
balance sheet date. Financial liabilities recognized at amortized cost amounted to SEK 8,100 M (7,585)
and financial liabilities recognized at fair value amounted to SEK 10 M (7).

The total recognized value of the Parent Company’s financial liabilities amounted to SEK 10,304 M
(9,438) on the balance sheet date. Financial liabilities recognized at amortized cost amounted to SEK
10,294 M (9,431) and financial liabilities recognized at fair value amounted to SEK 10 M (7).


-----

**_Purchased debt_**
Purchased debt is classified as loan receivables and recognized at amortized cost according to an
effective interest method. The Group determines the carrying value by calculating the present value of
estimated future cash flows at the receivables’ original effective interest rate. Revaluations are
recognized in the income statement. In the company’s opinion, the market’s yield requirements in the
form of effective interest rates on new portfolios have remained fairly constant despite turbulence in
global financial markets in recent years. With this valuation method, the carrying value is the best
estimate of the fair value of debt portfolios, in the company’s opinion. On the balance sheet date, the
recognized value of purchased debt amounted to SEK 7,027 M (6,197). An account of purchased debt
by year acquired is provided in Note 34.

**_Accounts receivable_**
Accounts receivable are recognized at amortized cost with no discount being applied since the
remaining maturity is judged to be short. Accounts receivable amounted to SEK 285 M (307) on the
balance sheet date.

**_Other receivables_**
Other receivables have short maturities. Receivables in foreign currency are translated in the accounts
at balance sheet date rates. Consequently, carrying value corresponds to fair value. Other receivables,
including accrued income, amounted to SEK 1,180 M (1,321) on the balance sheet date. The item
includes forward exchange contracts valued at SEK 8 M (43), which are classified as assets measured
at fair value through profit and loss (held for sale). The remaining SEK 1,172 M (1,278) is classified as
loan receivables.

For the Parent Company, other receivables, including receivables from Group companies, amounted to
SEK 6,939 M (4,834). The item includes forward exchange contracts valued at SEK 8 M (43), which are
classified as assets measured at fair value through profit and loss (held for sale). The remaining SEK
6,931 M (4,791) is classified as loan receivables.

**_Liquid assets_**
Liquid assets mainly consist of bank balances. Liquid assets in foreign currency are translated in the
accounts at balance sheet date rates. Consequently, carrying value corresponds to fair value. Cash and
bank balances are classified as loan receivables and amounted at year-end to SEK 265 M (266). For
the Parent Company, the corresponding amount was SEK 37 M (12) on the balance sheet date.

**_Liabilities to credit institutions_**
The Parent Company’s and the Group’s loan liabilities carry market rate interest with short fixed interest
terms. Liabilities in foreign currency are translated in the accounts at balance sheet date rates.
Consequently, carrying value corresponds to fair value. On the balance sheet date, consolidated
liabilities to credit institutions amounted to SEK 2,356 M (1,812) and for the Parent Company, they
amounted to SEK 2,356 M (1,811).

**_Bond loan_**
The Parent Company and the Group had bond loans outstanding for a value of SEK 3,124 M (3,231)
on the balance sheet date.

**_Commercial papers_**
The Parent Company and the Group had commercial papers outstanding for a value of SEK 635 M
(728) on the balance sheet date.

**_Accounts payable_**
Accounts payable have short maturities. Liabilities in foreign currency are translated in the accounts at
balance sheet date rates. Consequently, carrying value corresponds to fair value. Consolidated
accounts payable amounted to SEK 139 M (159). For the Parent Company, the equivalent amount was
SEK 5 (7).


-----

**_Other liabilities_**
The Parent Company’s and the Group’s other liabilities have short maturities. Liabilities in foreign
currency are translated in the accounts at balance sheet date rates. Consequently, carrying value
corresponds to fair value. Other liabilities, including accrued expenses amounted to SEK 1,856 M on
the balance sheet date (1,661). The item includes forward exchange contracts for SEK 10 M (7),
recognized at fair value through profit and loss (held for sale). Other liabilities, excluding these forward
exchange contracts amounted to SEK 1,846 M (1,654).

For the Parent Company, other liabilities amounted to SEK 4,185 M (3,660) on the balance sheet date
and included liabilities to Group companies and accrued expenses. Forward exchange contracts are
recognized at fair value through profit and loss (held for sale) and amounted to SEK 10 M (7). Other
liabilities, excluding these forward exchange contracts amounted to SEK 4,175 M (3,653).

**_Offset of financial instruments_**
Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value comprise currency derivatives. Financial assets
and liabilities are not offset in the balance sheet. However, there are legally binding agreements that
allow offsetting should one of the counterparties for the Group’s currency derivatives suspend their
payments. At the end of the year, Intrum Justitia had financial assets totaling SEK 6 M (2) that could be
offset against debts should the counterparties suspend their payments.

**34** **Financial risks and financial policies**
**Principles of financing and financial risk management**
The financial risks that arise in Intrum Justitia’s operations are limited. Thanks to a strong cash flow,
combined with little need for investment and operating capital, external capital needs in the Group’s
Credit Management operations are relatively low. The purchased debt operations have a greater need
for capital, particularly during a growth phase.

Intrum Justitia’s financing and financial risks are managed within the Group in accordance with the
treasury policy established by the Board of Directors. The treasury policy contains rules for managing
financial activities, delegating responsibility, measuring and identifying financial risks and limiting these
risks.

Internal and external financial operations are concentrated in Group Treasury in Stockholm, which
ensures economies of scale when pricing financial transactions. Because Group Treasury can take
advantage of temporary surpluses and deficits in the Group’s various countries of operation, the
Group’s total interest expense can be minimized.

**Market risk**
Market risk consists of risks related to changes in exchange rates and interest rate levels.

**_Exchange rate risk_**
Exchange rate risk is the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates will negatively affect the Group’s
income statement, balance sheet and/ or cash flows. The most important currencies for the Intrum
Justitia Group, other than the Swedish krona (SEK), are the euro (EUR), the Swiss franc (CHF), the
Hungarian forint (HUF), the Danish krone (DKK), the Norwegian krone (NOK) and the Polish zloty
(PLN).

The following exchange rates have been used to translate transactions in foreign currency in the
financial accounts:

Exchange rate risk can be divided into transaction exposure and translation exposure. Transaction
exposure consists of net operating and financial receipts and disbursements in different currencies.
Translation exposure consists of the effects from the translation of the financial reports of foreign
subsidiaries and associated companies to SEK.

**_Transaction exposure_**
In each country, all income and most operating expenses are denominated in local currencies, and thus
currency fluctuations have only a limited impact on the company’s operating earnings in local currency.
National operations seldom have receivables and liabilities in foreign currency. Income and expenses
in national currency are thereby hedged in a natural way, which limits transaction exposure. The
currency exposure that arises within the operating activities is limited to the extent it pertains to
international collection operations. The subsidiaries’ projected flow exposure is not hedged at present.
All major known currency flows are hedged on a continuous basis in the Group and the Parent
Company through forward exchange contracts.

**_Translation exposure_**
Intrum Justitia operates in around 20 countries. The results and financial position of subsidiaries are
reported in the relevant foreign currencies and later translated into SEK for inclusion in the consolidated
financial statements. Consequently, fluctuations in the SEK exchange rate against these currencies
affect consolidated income and earnings, as well as equity and other items in its financial statements.
The Group’s revenues are distributed by currency as follows:

**SEKm                                                                           2015            2014**

An appreciation of the Swedish krona of 10 percentage points on average in 2015 against the Euro
would thus, all else being equal, have affected revenues by SEK –284 M, against CHF by SEK –76 M,
against HUF by SEK –38 M, against DKK by SEK –24 M, against NOK by SEK –21 M and against PLN
by SEK –18 M.

In terms of net assets by currency, shareholders’ equity in the Group, including non-controlling interests,

would have affected shareholders’ equity in the Group by SEK –149 M, against CHF by SEK –12 M,


-----

against HUF by SEK –30 M, against DKK by SEK –3 M, against NOK by SEK –6 M and against PLN
by SEK –21 M.

Regarding the currency risk attributable to currency interest rate swaps, see the description below
under Interest rate risks.

**_Interest rate risks_**
Interest rate risks relate primarily to the Group’s interest-bearing net debt, which amounted to
SEK 6,026 M (5,635) on December 31, 2015. The loan rate is tied to the market rate.

Intrum Justitia has a strong cash flow which gives the Group the option of repaying loans, repurchasing
treasury shares or investing in the operations. The Group’s loans have short fixed interest terms –
currently about seven months (ten) for the entire loan portfolio.

A one-percent increase in market interest rates would have adversely affected net financial items by
approximately SEK 58 M. A five-percent increase would have adversely affected net financial items by
SEK 292 M.

In 2012 the Parent Company issued bonds for SEK 1,000 M, in 2013 for a further SEK 1,000 M, and in
2014 for a further SEK 1,000 M. No new bonds were issued in 2015. On the balance sheet date,
reported debt totaled EUR 3,124 M. To achieve correct currency matching in the balance sheet and thus
manage the currency risk between assets and liabilities, the company used currency interest rate
swaps. Consequently, the Parent Company has exchanged the liability to the bond holders in SEK with
one of the relation banks, receiving EUR at the same rate on both the start and closing dates. The
company has thus maintained the level at which it secures shareholders’ equity in EUR at the same
level as prior to the issue and has also maintained its currency exposure in the same currency.

**Liquidity risk**
Liquidity risk is the risk of a loss or higher-than-expected costs to ensure the Group’s ability to fulfill its
short and long-term payment obligations to outside parties.

The Group’s long-term financing risk is minimized through longterm financing in the form of committed
lines of credit. The Group’s objective is that at least 35 percent of total committed loans have a
remaining maturity of at least three years and that not more than 35 percent of the total have a
remaining maturity of less than 12 months. The Group has a syndicated loan facility of EUR 7,500 M
from Nordea and Swedbank. The maturity structure means that the bank loan matures by
SEK 2.5 billion each year in 2018, 2019 and 2020 respectively.

While available, the facility was utilized by the Parent Company, which withdrew amounts in various
currencies, with short maturities, usually SEK, EUR, CHF, NOK or PLN and usually with maturities of
three to six months. The loan is carried primarily in foreign currency, to hedge the Group against
translation exposure in relation to net assets outside Sweden.

The Group’s loan facility is subject to a number of operational and financial conditions. If the limits are
exceeded the loans fall due. The Group Management Team carefully monitors these key financial
indicators, so that it can quickly take measures if there is a risk that a limit may be exceeded.

In 2012 bond program for SEK 3,000 M was launched in which the Parent Company issued
SEK 1,000 M over five years with an interest margin of 3.10 percent in 2012, a further SEK 1,000 M
over five years with an interest margin of 2.22 percent in 2013, and a further SEK 1,000 M over five
years with an interest margin of 1.60 percent in 2014. No new bonds were issued in 2015.

Intrum Justitia has also issued commercial papers with a carrying amount of SEK 635 M (728) at
year-end.

The Group’s aim is that the liquidity reserve, which consists of cash, bank balances and short-term
liquid investments should amount to at least SEK 100 M more than the unutilized portion of committed
lines of credit. The Group has deposited its liquid assets with established financial institutions where the
risk of loss is considered remote. The Group’s finance function prepares regular liquidity forecasts with
the purpose of optimizing the balance between loans and liquid funds so that the net interest expense
is minimized without, for that matter, incurring difficulties in meeting external commitments.

The table below provides an analysis of the financial liabilities of the Group and the Parent Company
broken down according to the amount of time remaining until the contractual maturity date. The
amounts given in the table are the contractual, undiscounted cash flows. The amounts falling due within
12 months agree with the reported amounts since the discount effect is negligible.

**Credit risks**
Credit risk consists of the risk that Intrum Justitia’s counterparties are unable to fulfill their obligations
to the Group.

Financial assets that potentially subject the Group to credit risk include cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, purchased debt, outlays on behalf of clients, derivatives and guarantees. For
financial assets owned by Intrum Justitia, no collateral or other credit reinforcements have been
received. The maximum credit exposure for each class of financial assets therefore corresponds to the
carrying amount.

**_Liquid assets_**
The Group’s cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of bank balances and other short-term
financial assets with a remaining maturity of less than three months. The Group has deposited its liquid
assets with established financial institutions where the risk of loss is considered remote.


-----

**_Accounts receivable_**
The Group’s accounts receivable from clients and debtors in various industries, and are not
concentrated in a specific geographical region. The Group’s largest client accounts for less than two
percent of revenues. Most accounts receivable outstanding are with customers previously known to the
Group and whose creditworthiness is good. For an analysis of accounts receivable by age, see Note 16.

**_Purchased debt_**
As part of its operations, Intrum Justitia acquires portfolios of consumer receivables and tries to collect
them. Unlike its conventional collection operations where Intrum Justitia works on behalf of clients in
return for commissions and fees, in this case it assumes all the rights and risks associated with the
receivables. The portfolios are purchased at prices significantly below their nominal value, and Intrum
Justitia retains the entire amount it collects, including interest and fees.

The acquired receivables are overdue and in many cases are from debtors who are having payment
problems. It is obvious, therefore, that the entire nominal amount of the receivable will not be recovered.
On the other hand, the receivables are acquired at prices significantly below their nominal value. The
risk in this business is that Intrum Justitia, at the time of acquisition, overestimates its ability to collect
the amounts or underestimates the costs of collection. The maximum theoretical risk is of course that
the entire carrying value of SEK 7,027 M (6,197) would become worthless and have to be written off.

To minimize the risks in this business, Intrum Justitia exercises prudence in its purchase decisions. The
focus is on small and medium-sized portfolios with relatively low average amounts, to help spread risks.
The average nominal value per case is approximately SEK 9,300. Portfolios are normally acquired from
customers with whom the Group has had a long-term relationship. The acquisitions generally involve
unsecured debt, requiring relatively less capital and significantly simplifying administration compared
with collateralized receivables. Intrum Justitia places high yield requirements on the portfolios it
acquires. Before every acquisition, a careful assessment is made based on a projection of future cash
flows (collected amount) from the portfolio. In these calculations Intrum Justitia benefits from its
extensive experience in debt collection and from the Group’s scoring methods. Intrum Justitia therefore
believes that it has the expertise required to evaluate these types of receivables. To enable acquisitions
of larger portfolios at attractive risk levels, Intrum Justitia has, on occasion, partnered with other
companies such as Crédit Agricole, Goldman Sachs and East Capital to share the capital investment
and return.

The currency risk attributable to the currency revaluation of the balance sheet item Purchased Debt is
limited through currency hedging by having loans in the same currencies as the assets, and by currency
forward contracts.

A considerable proportion of purchased debt acquisitions take place through forward flow agreements –
that is, Intrum Justitia may have previously agreed with a company to acquire all of that company’s
accounts receivable at a certain percentage of their nominal value once they are past-due by a certain
number of days. In most of these agreements, however, Intrum Justitia has the opportunity to decline
to acquire the receivables if, for example, their quality decreases.

Risks are diversified by acquiring receivables from clients in different sectors and different countries.
The Group’s purchased debt portfolios include debtors in 20 countries. The Group’s total carrying
amount for purchased debt is distributed as follows:


-----

The Group’s purchased debt portfolios are distributed by sector as follows:

Of the total carrying value on the balance sheet date, 30 percent represents portfolio acquisitions in
2015, 19 percent acquisitions in 2014, 20 percent acquisitions in 2013 and 11 percent acquisitions in
2012. The remaining 20 percent relates to receivables acquired in or before 2011, which have therefore
been past due for more than four years. In the case of a large share of the oldest receivables, Intrum
Justitia has reached agreement with the debtors on payment plans.

**_Outlays on behalf of clients_**
As an element in its operations, the Group incurs outlays for court fees, legal representation,
enforcement authorities, etc., which can be charged to and collected from debtors. In many cases
Intrum Justitia has agreements with its clients whereby any expenses that cannot be collected from
debtors are instead refunded by the client. The amount that is expected to be recovered from a solvent
counterparty is recognized as an asset in the balance sheet on the line Other receivables.

**_Derivative contracts_**
The Parent Company and the Group hold forward exchange contracts to a limited extent. The credit risk
in the Group’s forward exchange contracts is because the counterparty generally is a large bank or
financial institution that is not expected to become insolvent. On the balance sheet date, assets
regarding forward exchange contracts were valued at SEK 8 M (43), and liabilities at SEK 10 M (7). See
Note 33 regarding the possibility of offsetting receivables and liabilities for derivative contracts.

The contracts have short maturities, typically one or more months. All outstanding forward exchange
contracts are restated at fair value in the accounts, with adjustments recognized in the income
statement. Changes in the value of forward exchange contracts recognized during the year in the
income statement amounted to SEK –61 M (–43). The purpose of these forward exchange contracts
has been to minimize exchange rate differences in the Parent Company attributable to receivables and
liabilities in foreign currency. These exchange rate differences amounted to SEK 59 M (46) during the
year. The net effect through profit or loss of exchange rate differences attributable to receivables and
liabilities as well as forward exchange contracts is SEK –2 M (3).

The Parent Company and the Group also hold currency interest rate swaps that were signed in
connection with the Parent Company’s issue of bonds in SEK. To achieve suitable currency matching
between assets and liabilities, liabilities in SEK were exchanged to EUR at the same rate on the starting
date and the date of maturity.


-----

**_Payment guarantees_**
The Group offers services whereby clients, against payment, obtain a guarantee from Intrum Justitia
regarding the clients’ receivables from their customers. This entails a risk being incurred that Intrum
Justitia must compensate the customer for the guaranteed amount in the event that the invoices are not
paid on time. In those cases where the guarantee comes into play, Intrum Justitia assumes the client’s
claim against its customer and takes over the continued handling of the case within the Purchased Debt
area of operations. The total guarantee at year-end amounted to SEK 230 M (1,961), of which
receivables overdue by more than 30 days amounted to SEK 99 M (63). Intrum Justitia’s risk in this
business is managed through strict credit limits and analyses of card applicants’ credit status. As of
year-end Intrum Justitia had allocated SEK 3 M (22) in the balance sheet to cover payments that may
arise due to the guarantee.

**35** **Acquisitions of operations**
In the Cash flow statement, the amount reported as Purchases of shares in subsidiaries and
associated companies is SEK –181 M (–148). The amount for 2015 consists of the acquisitions of
Credita SEK –33 M, Logicomer SEK –112 M and other acquisitions SEK –36 M as specified below. The
amount for 2014 consists of the acquisitions of Advis SEK –171 M, Profidebt SEK 26 M and other
acquisitions SEK –3 M.

**Acquisition of 100 percent of the shares in Credita**
In February, Intrum Justitia acquired a smaller credit management company in Switzerland, Credita AG,
with a good market position in the public sector and health insurance. Credita AG had 19 employees.

The purchase price amounted to SEK 51 M.

The acquired company was consolidated effective from February 2015 and has contributed to
consolidated revenues by SEK 21 M. If the acquisition would have been executed by January 1, it would
have contributed to the Group’s revenues by SEK 23 M.

The acquisition is reported as follows in the consolidated balance sheet:

**Acquisition of 100 percent of the shares in Logicomer**
In September, Intrum Justitia agreed to acquire the Portuguese company Logicomer Gestão e
Recuperação de Créditos SA, which operates primarily in credit management services, but also has a
purchased debt portfolio with a nominal value of approximately SEK 1.2 billion. The company has 40
employees and very good profitability. The acquisition Logicomer is expected to contribute positively to
Intrum Justitia’s earnings and market position in Portugal, with the company adding expertise in certain
areas of collection.


-----

The purchase price amounted to SEK 187 M.

The acquired company was consolidated effective from November 2015 and has contributed to
consolidated revenues by SEK 9 M. If the acquisition would have been executed by January 1, it would
have contributed to the Group’s revenues by SEK 48 M.

**Other acquisitions in 2015**
In June, a minority stake was acquired in the French company IJCOF SAS, which operates in credit
management for consumer receivables, whereby ownership rose from 70 percent to 100 percent. The
investment amounted to SEK 13 M, and did not give rise to any goodwill in the consolidated balance
sheet.

In October, 90 percent of the shares in a small credit management company in France, Cabinet PPN
SAS, were acquired for a purchase consideration of SEK 11 M. The acquisition did not give rise to any
goodwill in the consolidated balance sheet.

During the year, Intrum Justitia acquired shares in the joint venture Avarda AB for SEK 10 M.

**Acquisition in 2014 of 100 percent of the shares in Profidebt**
In January 2014, Intrum Justitia agreed to acquire 100 percent of the shares in Czech company
Profidebt sro for a cash purchase consideration of SEK 90 M. The company’s operations mainly
comprised purchased debt and, at the time of acquisition, it held a portfolio of receivables that Intrum
Justitia valued at SEK 276 M. The acquired company was consolidated as of February 2014. The
acquisition analysis was detailed in the 2014 annual report.

**Acquisition in 2014 of 100 percent of the shares in Advis**
In January 2014, Intrum Justitia agreed to acquire 100 percent of the shares in the Danish company
Advis A/S for a cash purchase consideration of SEK 174 M. Advis was a leading credit management
company in Denmark – a market leader in the telecom sector, also with a strong presence in the media
and energy segments. The acquired company was consolidated effective from September 2014.

**36** **Critical estimates and assumptions**
To be able to prepare the accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices,
company management and the Board of Directors must make assessments and assumptions that affect
reported income and expense items, asset and liability items, as well as other disclosures. Management
has discussed with the Audit Committee the Group’s critical accounting principles and estimates as well
as the application of these.

Estimates and assumptions are continuously assessed on the basis of historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events considered reasonable under prevailing conditions.
Actual outcomes may vary from the assessments made.

The areas in which estimates and assumptions could entail significant risk of adjustment in the
recognized amounts for assets and liabilities in future financial years are primarily the following:

**Impairment testing of goodwill**
As indicated in Note 10, an impairment test of goodwill was performed prior to the preparation of the
annual accounts. The geographical regions are judged to achieve a sufficient degree of integration that
they form combined cash generating units. Recoverable amounts for cash generating units have been
established by calculating their value in use. The assumptions and assessments made with regard to
expected cash flows and discount rates in the form of weighted average cost of capital, as well as a
sensitivity analysis are detailed in Note 10. Projections of future cash flows are based on the best
possible assessments of future income and operating expenses.

**Purchased debt**
As indicated in Note 16, the recognition of purchased debt is based on the company’s own projection
of future cash flows from acquired portfolios. Although the company has historically had good projection
accuracy with regard to cash flows, future deviations cannot be ruled out.

The Group applies internal rules and a formalized decision-making process in the adjustment of
previously established cash flow projections. These entail, among other things, that cash flow
projections are only in exceptional cases adjusted in the first year of ownership of a portfolio.
Furthermore, the decision to amend a cash flow projection is preceded by a discussion between the
local management in the country in question and the management of the service line. All changes in
cash flow projections are ultimately decided on by a central revaluation committee.

**Useful lifetimes of intangible fixed assets**
Group management establishes assessed useful lifetimes and thus consistent amortization and
depreciation for the Group’s intangible fixed assets. These estimates are based on historical knowledge
of equivalent assets’ useful lifetimes. Useful lifetimes and estimated residual values are tested on each


-----

balance sheet date and adjusted when necessary. Recognized values for each balance sheet date for
intangible fixed assets, see Note 10.

**Assessment of deferred tax assets**
Deferred tax assets for tax-loss carryforwards or other future tax deductions are recognized to the
extent it is deemed likely that the deduction can be made against future taxable surpluses.

Carrying amounts for deferred tax assets on each balance sheet date are provided in Note 8.

**Reporting of Polish investment fund**
The Group has operated in Poland since 2006 through an investment fund designed to purchase and
own portfolios of written-off receivables. Intrum Justitia is the fund’s only owner, and from the Group’s
perspective it essentially operates like a subsidiary. Against this backdrop, Intrum Justitia has resolved
to consolidate the investment fund in the consolidated financial statements as a subsidiary.

**37   Related parties**
In addition to associated companies and joint ventures, related parties include the Board of Directors
and senior executives, according to Note 28, as well as close family members to these executives and
other companies over which they can exert a significant influence.

All transactions with related parties are conducted on market terms and at arm’s length.

In 2015, Intrum Justitia purchased services for SEK 1 M (0) from Caperio AB, an IT company where
Intrum Justitia’s country manager in Sweden, Per-Henrik Persson is a Board member.

Although the Parent Company has close relationship to its subsidiaries, see Note 12, it has no
transactions with other related parties.

During the year, the Parent Company had SEK 102 M (92) of revenues from selling services to
subsidiaries in the Group, and SEK 9 M (9) of costs for acquiring services from subsidiaries in the
Group.

**Notes to the audited consolidated financial statements**

**1** **Accounting Principles**
Lock Lower Holding AS consolidated financial statements for first quarter of 2017 has been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European
Union, as well as the Norwegian Accounting Act.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost
method, except for derivative instruments that are measured according to IAS 32.

The parent company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Norwegian
Accounting Act as well as NGAAP.

This interim report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting. The
accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year for Lock Lower
Holding AS (see consolidated Financial Statements of Lock Lower Holding AS 2016).

The Parent Company’s reporting currency is euro (EUR), which is also the reporting currency for the
Group. The consolidated financial statements are presented in EUR and all values are rounded to the
nearest million (EURm) except when otherwise indicated. The consolidated and parent company
accounts pertain to 1 January to 31 March for income statements and 31 March for items on the
statements of financial position.

**2** **Operating segments**
Management has determined the operating segments based on information reviewed by management
for the purpose of allocating resources and assessing performance. Management considers the
performance from a product perspective and separately considers the Debt Purchasing and Debt
Collection segments. Both segments meet the quantitative thresholds required by IFRS 8 for reportable
segments. Management assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of
Segment Earnings which is Net revenue minus direct operating expenses.

**Revenues**
Sales between segments are carried out at arm’s length. Net revenue from external parties reported to
management is measured in a manner consistent with that in the income statement. The following table
presents a reconciliation of the reportable segments’ main captions from profit and loss to the entity’s
profit and loss before tax.

**3** **Alternative Performance Measures**
The Lindorff Group uses the alternative performance measures “Adjusted EBITDA”, “Adjusted EBITDA
excluding NRIs”, “Net Interest Bearing Debt to Proforma Adjusted EBITDA excluding NRIs (LTM)” and
“Return in Debt Purchasing (LTM)”. The Group believes that the alternative performance measures are
useful complements for users of the financial report. “Adjusted EBITDA” serves as a cash proxy and a
measure that the Group considers to be relevant for understanding the results from operating activities
adjusted for portfolio amortisation and revaluation. “Adjusted EBITDA excluding NRIs” is a similar
measure which after the exclusion of non-recurring items provides a run rate result from operating
activities. The “Net Interest Bearing Debt to Proforma Adjusted EBITDA excluding NRIs” (LTM) ratio is
a leverage ratio used for reporting in relation to the Group’s bond indentures. “Return in Debt
Purchasing (LTM)” is a ratio used for measuring the segment earnings in percentage of average book
value of purchased loans and receivables for the last twelve months. Group definitions are unchanged
from previous periods and ratios defined as below:

**7** **Events after the end of the period**
On April 12 Nordic Capital Fund VIII, currently the indirect majority shareholder in Lindorff, notified the
European Commission of the intended combination of Intrum Justitia and Lindorff in order to proceed
under the EU Merger Regulation. Target remains to close the transaction during Q2 2017, as previously
communicated.

At the end of April 2017 Lindorff increased its foothold in Italy through a small bolt-on acquisition. The
acquisition provides Lindorff with additional Debt Collection capabilities and is another step forward for
the company in establishing a solid platform for both servicing and Debt Purchasing capabilities in the
Italian market.

**_Key Audit Matters_**
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in
our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context
of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not
provide a separate opinion on these matters.

We have during our audit focused on the two Furthermore, we have compared the estimated

-    Future estimated cash flows

-    Discount rate

_Calculation of amortised cost for purchased_
_loans and receivables_
_(See also note 14)_
We have focused on the calculation of amortised
cost for purchased loans and receivables
because it is a substantial estimate in the
financial statements which involves a significant
amount of data requiring accuracy in the
calculation. The estimates are primarily related
to assessment of future cash flows expected
from the individual portfolios of purchased loans
and receivables.


We have assessed the applied discount rate by
comparing critical input to observable market data,
where applicable. We compared non-observable
input to external research and market reports, and
challenged management on the reasonability of the
applied inputs.

We also compared the book value of goodwill with
the implicit value of the goodwill based on the
merger agreement with Intrum Justitia entered into
in 2016.

The result of the testing showed that the
assumptions used by management when
calculating the recoverable amount of goodwill
were reasonable.

We assessed the estimated future cash flows
management used when calculating amortised cost
for purchased loans and receivables. We compared
the historical actual cash flows with the
assumptions used when calculating the effective
interest rate upon the purchase of the portfolios.
When identifying larger deviations we assessed the
reasonableness of the explanations from
management supporting the conclusion not to
change future estimated cash flows in accordance
with historical under or over performance. In the
instances where management changed future
estimated cash flows, we assessed the
reasonableness of management’s explanation for
the changes made. The result of the testing showed
that the assumptions used by management when
determining future estimated cash flows were
reasonable.


-----

With regards to the accuracy of the data used in the
calculation of amortised cost, we performed a
series of tests of the data against supporting
documentation; for example testing that the future
estimated cash flows for a sample of portfolios
purchased in 2016 agreed to the cash flows used
when calculating the purchase price for the
portfolios. We also performed testing to ensure that
income from portfolios were accurately recorded in
accordance with the amortised cost principle. Our
tests included for example a recalculation of
recognised interest income by multiplying book
value at the start of the period by the effective
interest rate and comparing the sum of recalculated
interest income with the booked interest income in
the general ledger.
The testing did not detect material unexplained
differences.

**_Other information_**
Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises Key Figures, the
Board of Directors’ report, statements on Corporate Governance and Corporate Social Responsibility
and Alternative performance measures (APMs), but does not include the financial statements and our
auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any
form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this
other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

**_Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director for the Financial_**
**_Statements_**
The Board of Directors and the Managing Director (management) are responsible for the preparation
and fair presentation of the financial statements of the parent company in accordance with the
Norwegian Accounting Act and accounting standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, and
for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements of the group in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by EU, and for such internal control as
management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s and the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern. The financial statements of the parent company use the going concern basis of accounting
insofar as it is not likely that the enterprise will cease operations. The financial statements of the group
use the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or
to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

**_Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements_**
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an
audit conducted in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally
accepted in Norway, including ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate,


-----

they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally
accepted in Norway, including International Standards on Auditing (ISAs), we exercise professional
judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

-    identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due
to fraud or error. We design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override
of internal control.

-    obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.

-    evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by management.

-    conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to
events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a
going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention
in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures
are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained
up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the
Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

-    evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

-    obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial
statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.
We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control
that we identify during our audit

We also provide the Board of Directors with governance with a statement that we have complied with
relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships
and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable,
related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of
most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key
audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes
public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter
should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

**Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements**

**_Opinion on the Board of Directors’ report_**
Based on our audit of the financial statements as described above, it is our opinion that the information
presented in the Board of Directors’ report and in the statements on Corporate Governance and
Corporate Social Responsibility concerning the financial statements, the going concern assumption is
consistent with the financial statements and complies with the law and regulations.


-----

**_Opinion on Registration and Documentation_**
Based on our audit of the financial statements as described above, and control procedures we have
considered necessary in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements
_(ISAE) 3000, Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information,_
it is our opinion that management has fulfilled its duty to produce a proper and clearly set out
registration and documentation of the company’s accounting information in accordance with the law and
bookkeeping standards and practices generally accepted in Norway.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements**

**1** **General information**
The parent company Lock Lower Holding AS is a registered company domiciled in Oslo, Norway with
office address at Hoffsveien 70B, 0377 Oslo, Norway. The company is 100% owned by Lock Upper
Holding AS, Hoffsveien 70B, 0377 Oslo. The ultimate parent is Cidron 2013 Ltd, 26 Esplanade, St Helier
Jersey JE2 3QA.

Lock Lower Holding AS (the company) and its subsidiaries (together the Group) have two core business
segments; Debt Purchasing and Debt Collection. The Debt Purchasing segment consists of the
acquisition, management and collection of mainly unsecured non-performing loans. The Debt Collection
segment consists of collection for various external clients and on portfolios of loans and receivables
owned by Debt Purchasing as well as Real Estate Servicing. Other services include invoice and
payment services.

In 2016 the Group had offices in 13 countries – Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands,
Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Russia and the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania). Russia was
closed down in December 2016.

The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the period ended 31 December 2016 were
authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Board of Directors on 23 February 2017 and
presented to the Annual General Meeting on the same date.

**2** **Summary of significant accounting policies**
**2.1** **Basis of preparation**
The consolidated financial statements of Lock Lower Holding AS and all its subsidiaries have been
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as approved by the EU
(IFRS).

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying
the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or
areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are
disclosed in note 3.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for financial
derivatives that have been measured at fair value through profit or loss or at fair value through other
comprehensive income.

The parent company’s functional currency is in Norwegian Krone (NOK) and the presentation currency
for the parent company and for the Group is Euro (EUR). The consolidated financial statements are
presented in EUR and all values are rounded to the nearest million (EURm) except when otherwise
indicated. The consolidated and parent company accounts pertain to 1 January to 31 December for
income statements and 31 December for items on the statements of financial position.

_2.1.1 Changes in accounting policy and disclosures_
Financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2016 are the third financial statement for Lock
Lower Holding AS Group.

For information regarding Lindorff previous years see Lindorff First Holding AB Annual report 2013.

The Group has adopted all new and revised standards and interpretations issued by IASB and IFRIC
and approved by EU if relevant to the business and come into force for the accounting year starting
1 January 2016.


-----

_2.1.2 New standards and interpretations not yet adopted_
Certain new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations that are effective for annual
periods beginning after 1 January 2017 have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial
statements. None of these are expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial
statements of the Group. Below is a short description of the new standards and interpretations:

_IFRS 9 Financial Instruments:_
IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’ will replace IAS 39, and addresses the classification, measurement and
de-recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities and introduces new rules for hedge accounting.
IASB has issued a package of improvements for the accounting of financial instruments. The package
contains a model for the classification and measurement of financial instruments, a simplified approach
to hedge accounting and a forward-looking impairment model. IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be
classified in three categories: valuation at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive
income or fair value through profit or loss. The determination is made at initial recognition.

The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing its financial instruments and the
contractual cash flow characteristics of the instrument. For financial liabilities, the standard retains most
of the IAS 39 requirements. The main change is that, in cases where the fair value option is taken for
financial liabilities, the part of a fair value change due to an entity’s own credit risk is recorded in other
comprehensive income rather than the income statement, unless this creates an accounting mismatch.
The new standard also implements a new model for impairment of financial assets. The new impairment
model is an expected credit loss (ECL) model.

There will be no impact on the Group’s accounting for financial liabilities, as the new requirements only
affect the accounting for financial liabilities that are designated at fair value through profit or loss and
the Group does not currently have any such liabilities. The de-recognition rules have been transferred
from IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and have not been changed.

The new hedge accounting rules will align the accounting for hedging instruments more closely with the
Group’s risk management practices. As a general rule, more hedge relationships might be eligible for
hedge accounting, as the standard introduces a more principles-based approach. The Group has no
material hedging instruments, and hence the effect on the combined financial statements is not
expected to be significant for the Group.

The Groups preliminary assessment is that loans and receivables purchased by the Group should, in
accordance with IFRS 9, continue to be recognized at amortised cost, as in IAS 39, and hence there
will be no change to the accounting for these assets.

The new impairment model requires the recognition of impairment provisions based on expected credit
losses (ECL) rather than only incurred credit losses as in the case under IAS 39. It applies to financial
assets classified at amortised cost and loan commitments. The implementation of IFRS 9 could lead to
increased provisions for credit loss related to the Group’s payment services, due to the change from an
incurred loss model to an expected loss model. The new model for impairment of financial assets will
in most cases result in a higher impairment recognised at an earlier stage. Payment services, which is
an Invoice and Part Payment solution to merchants, currently represents a small part (<5%) of the
Group’s operations and financial assets. Changes in provisions for credit loss related to payment
services are consequently not expected to be significant for the Group’s combined financial statements.
IFRS 9 will come into effect on 1 January 2018. IFRS 9 was approved by European Commission at
22 November 2016 and early adoption is permitted. The Group will not utilise the opportunity for early
adoption.

_IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers:_
IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’, will replace IAS 18 which covers contracts for
goods and services and IAS 11 which covers construction contracts. The new standard will be effective
for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and is based on the principle that revenue is
recognised when control of a good or service transfers to a customer – so the notion of control replaces
the existing notion of risks and rewards. IFRS 15 implements a new model to consider transaction price,
allocation and recognition. The revenue model can be illustrated as a 5-step model that has to be
evaluated, concluded and documented for each contract. It has extensive disclosure requirements. The
core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods


-----

or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be
entitled in exchange of those goods or services.

The new revenue standard is applicable to all entities and will supersede all current revenue recognition
requirements under IFRS. Contracts with customers that will be accounted for in accordance with
IFRS 9 Financial instruments shall, however, follow the requirements in IFRS 9, as they are scoped out
of IFRS 15. The Group’s revenue on purchased loans and receivables are recognised according to
IFRS 9 at amortised cost using the effective interest method, and consequently, will not be affected by
the implementation of IFRS 15. Lindorff has not finalised the investigation of the impact on the
segments Debt Collection or Other Services, but as the majority of the revenues from these segments
relates to commission and debt collection fees recognised on collection of the debt, the current
assessment is that the new standard will not have any significant impact on the Groups financial
statements. IFRS 15 is yet not approved by Norwegian Accounting Standards Board (NASB).

_IFRS 16 Leases:_
IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016 and will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after
1 January 2019. It will result in almost all leases being recognised on the balance sheet, as the
distinction between operating and finance leases is removed. Under the new standard, an asset (the
right to use the leased item) and a financial liability to pay rentals are recognised. The only exceptions
are short-term and low-value leases. The accounting for lessors will not significantly change. The
standard will affect primarily the accounting for the Group’s operating leases. As at the reporting date,
the Group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of EUR 45m, see note 28. However, the
Group has not yet determined to what extent these commitments will result in the recognition of an
asset and a liability for future payments and how this will affect the Group’s profit and classification of
cash flows. Some of the commitments may be covered by the exception for short-term and low-value
leases which are not in the scope of the standard and some commitments may relate to arrangements
that will not qualify as leases under IFRS 16. The Group will make more detailed assessments of the
impact over the next twelve months. IFRS 16 is not yet approved by European Commission.

**2.2** **Basis of consolidation**
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group and its
subsidiaries as at 31 December 2016.

Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains
control, and continue to be consolidated until the date when such control ceases. The financial
statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company, using
consistent accounting policies. All intra-group balances, transactions, unrealised gains and losses
resulting from intra-group transactions and dividends are eliminated in full.

Total comprehensive income within a subsidiary is attributed to the non-controlling interest even if it
results in a deficit balance.

_Subsidiaries_
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Lock Lower Holding AS and
entities where the Group has controlling interest (subsidiaries). Controlling interest is achieved when
the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain
benefits from its activities. The Company obtains and exercises control through direct or indirect voting
rights. Controlling interest will normally exist when the Company has voting rights of more than 50%
through ownership or agreements.

_Co-investments_
Entities where Lindorff holds majority of equity but co-investors have the controlling interest of the entity
are not consolidated.

_Other investment structures_
Investments in other entities within our industry via financial instruments are consolidated if Lindorff
through servicing agreements and investment has the power to govern the financial and operating
policies of the entity to obtain benefits from its activities. In case the consolidation requirements are not


-----

met, the investment is reported as ownership in relative part of assets and liabilities as well as net
revenue and expenses.

_Equity transactions_
If put options are issued to non-controlling shareholders, it is reported as a financial liability at the
present value of future payments. Any revaluations are recognised through equity as transactions
between shareholders.

_Consolidation principles_
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared using the same reporting year as the parent
company, but they are not always prepared in accordance with IFRS. Consequently, for consolidation
purposes, the figures for the subsidiaries have been revised to conform to the Group accounting
policies in accordance with IFRS. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year
are included in the consolidated income statement from the date of control is obtained and until the
control ceases. Intercompany transactions, balances, revenues and expenses are eliminated in
consolidation. This also applies for unrealized internal gains and losses.

The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration
transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities
incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group. The
consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent
consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities
assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the
fair value of non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If
this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference
is recognised in profit or loss.

There is a reassessment of the allocation of the acquisition price within 12 months after the acquisition
date when the initial accounting for a business combination can be determined only provisionally.

**2.3** **Segment reporting**
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating
resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the CEO. The
operating businesses are organised and managed separately according to the nature of the products
and services provided, with each segment representing a strategic business unit that offers different
products and serves different markets.

The Group is organised in two main operating segments: Debt Purchasing and Debt Collection. The
Debt Purchasing segment consists of acquisition and management of mainly unsecured
non-performing loans and receivables. The Debt Collection segment consists of collection for various
clients and on portfolios of loans and receivables owned by Debt Purchasing as well as Real Estate
Servicing.

The Group’s Other segment relates to revenues not related to the main operating segments.

The total revenue from external customers and intersegment sales are specified by country in note 5.

**2.4** **Foreign currency translation**
The consolidated financial statements are presented in EUR, which is the Group’s presentation
currency.

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the
currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”).


-----

The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from the
presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:

a)    assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented (i.e. including
comparatives) are translated at the closing rate at the date of the financial position;

b)    income and expenses for each income statement (i.e. including comparatives) are translated at
average exchange rates and

c)    all exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income

Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency rate at the date of the
transaction or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting
from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at the year-end exchange rates of
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income
statement. Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents
are presented in income statement within “finance income or costs”. Foreign exchange gains and
losses on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities such as financial liabilities at fair value through
profit or loss are recognised in profit or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets
and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising are
recognised in other comprehensive income.

**2.5** **Tangible assets**
Tangible assets are recognised at cost, excluding the costs of day-to-day servicing, less accumulated
depreciation and accumulated impairment. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of such
tangible assets when that cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met. Depreciation is calculated
on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the assets. The useful lives of tangible assets, fixtures and
furniture are three to five years.

The carrying value of tangible assets is reviewed for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

An item of tangible assets is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are
expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as
the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in
the income statement in the year the asset is derecognised.

The asset’s residual values, useful lives and methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each
financial year-end.

**2.6** **Intangible assets**
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible
assets acquired in a business combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial
recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any
accumulated impairment losses. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or
indefinite. The Group’s intangible assets are assessed to be finite except goodwill and brand.

Intangible assets with finite lives are mainly amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be
impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite
useful life are reviewed at least at each financial year-end. Changes in the expected useful life or the
expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset is accounted for by
changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and treated as changes in accounting
estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the income
statement as an expense and included in “Amortisation of intangible fixed assets”.


-----

_a)_ _Goodwill_
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration
transferred over the Group’s interest in net fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities of the acquiree and the fair value of the non-controlling interest in the acquiree.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the
acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating
units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to
which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is
monitored for internal management purposes. The operating segment level is Debt Purchasing and
Debt Collection. The goodwill is mainly allocated to the Debt Collection segment.

Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The carrying value of the goodwill is compared to the
recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal. Any
impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.

_b)_ _Brand_
Any debt collection contracts awarded for reasons other than price alone are considered to be a result
of brand name. Lindorff brand is well known and respected and ensures us to be invited to participate
in competitive tender offers we otherwise might not be eligible to.

Brand arose on acquisition of subsidiary and got measured on initial recognition at cost. Of the three
main approaches to value the brand - Income, Market and Cost, Relief and Royalty income approach
was consider to be the most appropriate method for brand valuation.

Brand is assumed to have an indefinite useful life and impairment reviews are undertaken annually or
more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment.

_c)_ _Client relationships_
Client relationships are recognised in connection with business combinations and include the rights
related to collection contracts with a third party and got measured on initial recognition at cost. Client
relationships contracts are amortised straight line over their estimated useful lives. For client relations
the estimated useful life corresponds to the contract period (maximum 10 years).

_d)_ _Internally developed software_
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programs are recognised as an expense as
incurred. Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and
unique software products controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets when the
following criteria are met:
– it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use;
– management intends to complete the software product and use it;
– there is an ability to use or sell the software product;
– it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits;
– adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell
the software product are available; and the expenditure attributable to the software product during
its development can be reliably measured.

Directly attributable costs, capitalised as part of the software product, include employee costs and an
appropriate portion of relevant overheads.

Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as
incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a
subsequent period.

Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful
lives, which does not exceed five years unless strong indication of a longer useful life is demonstrated
(for instance by an underlying contract).


-----

**2.7** **Impairment of non-financial assets**
Intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life or intangible assets not ready to use are not subject
to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s
carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s
fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are
grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows (cash-generating
units).

Prior impairments of non-financial assets other than goodwill are reviewed for possible reversal at each
end of the reporting period. An assessment is made as to whether there is any indication that previously
recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the
recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has
been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last
impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its
recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been
determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
After such a reversal the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s revised
carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.

**2.8** **Financial assets**
_2.8.1 Classification_
Financial assets in the scope of IAS 39 are classified as either financial assets at fair value through
profit and loss or loans and receivables, as appropriate. The classification depends on the purpose for
which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial
assets at initial recognition.

a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset
is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives
are also categorised as held for trading. Assets in this category are classified as current assets if
expected to be settled within 12 months, otherwise they are classified as non-current. The Group’s
financial assets and derivatives at fair value through profit and loss comprise only minor investments in
shares.

b) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are
not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than
12 months after the end of the reporting period. These are classified as non-current assets. The Group’s
loans and receivables comprise mainly portfolios of purchased non-performing loans, “trade and other
receivables” and “cash and cash equivalents” (see note 14). Client funds are recognised on a separate
line in the Statement of financial position and therefore not included in the Group’s reported liquid
assets.

_2.8.2 Recognition and measurement_
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date which is the date on
which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value
plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss. Financial
assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction
costs are expensed in the income statement.

Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to receive the cash flows have expired
or the Group has transferred the financial assets without retaining control or substantially all the risk and
rewards of ownership of the financial assets.

Loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.


-----

Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the “financial assets at fair value through
profit or loss” category are presented in the income statement within “Other (losses)/gains-net” in the
period in which they arise.

_Purchased loans and receivables_
Purchased loans and receivables are portfolios of non performing claims. A portfolio is defined to be the
lowest reliable level for pool of accounts with similar attributes. Typically, each portfolio consists of an
individual acquisition of accounts. Each portfolio is classified in the loans and receivable category and
is initially recorded at fair value including external cost of acquiring the portfolio. The portfolio is
accounted for as a single unit for the recognition of income, principal payments and adjustments from
recalculation of the estimated future cash flows.

The accounting policy is also applied when one or more portfolios are acquired in a business
combination.

Significant estimates are made by the management with respect to the collectability of future cash flows
from portfolios. The cash flow estimates are prepared by management on a rolling 15 year basis. If the
cash flow estimates are revised, the carrying amount is recalculated to reflect actual and revised
estimated cash flows by computing the present value of estimated future cash flows using the initial
effective interest rate. An adjustment in the carrying amount is recognised in net revenue. See 2.20
Revenue recognition for further information.

Management’s interpretations of historical cash flows, type of receivable, age, face value of the
individual account and experience from other portfolios form the basis for the cash flow estimates. As
these estimates are prepared on a rolling 15 year basis, an additional year is included in the 15 year
cash flow forecast each year. The effect of including an additional year is recorded as a revaluation in
the income statement. Actual results may differ from the estimates, making it reasonably possible that
a change in estimates could occur within one year and impact the carrying value of the related loans
and receivables. On a quarterly basis, management reviews the estimates of future cash flows, and
whether it is reasonably possible that its assessment of collectability may change based on actual
results and other factors that may have an impact on the estimates.

On a regular basis, the Group acquires portfolios on a forward flow basis. This means that a contract
is established for purchases of debt at an agreed price, but where the volumes of debt are not fully
known at the time of agreement. The acquisition (delivery) of forward flow debts can be done on weekly,
monthly or quarterly basis. The effective interest rate is calculated by contract and used for each batch.
If experience indicates a change in the attributes of the claims management may decide to apply a new
effective interest rate for new batches.

_Other financial assets_
Long-term loans and receivables and other receivables are those that arise when the company provides
money without the intent to trade its claim. If the anticipated maturity is longer than one year they
constitute long-term receivables, and if it is shorter they are short-term receivables. Loans and
receivables are initially recognised at fair value and measured at amortised cost.

**2.9** **Impairment of financial assets**
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a
financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets
is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a
result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a “loss event”) and
that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or a
group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.

Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors are experiencing
significant financial difficulty, default of delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that
they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization, and where observable data indicate that
there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or
economic conditions that correlate with defaults.


-----

For loans and receivables category, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial
asset’s initial effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the
loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement. If a loan has a variable interest rate, the
discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under
the contract.

If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be
related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the reversal of the
previously recognised impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement.

**2.10 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities**
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge its risks
associated with interest rate. Such derivative financial instruments are initially and subsequently
measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities
when the fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives
during the year are taken directly to the income statement.

If put options are issued to non-controlling shareholders, it is reported as a financial liability at the
present value of future payments. Any revaluations are recognised through equity as transactions
between shareholders.

**2.11 Trade and other receivables**
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers in the ordinary course of business. If collection is
expected in one year or less, they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as
non-current assets. Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured
at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any credit losses recognised.

Legal fees/bailiff costs: The Group incurs outlays for bailiff/court costs, legal representation,
enforcement authorities, etc. which can be charged to and collected from debtors. In certain cases
Lindorff has agreements with its clients where expenses that cannot be collected from the debtor are
instead refunded by the client. The amount that is expected to be recovered from the client is
recognised as an asset in Other short term receivables.

Client funds: Client funds are reported as assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position and
comprise cash received on collection of a specific debt on behalf of a client and which are to be passed
on to the clients within a specified period.

**2.12 Cash and cash equivalents**
Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and in hand and short-term
deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.

**2.13 Equity**
Share capital is determined using the nominal value of shares that have been issued. Additional paid-in
capital includes any premiums received on the initial issuing of the share capital. Any transaction costs
associated with the issuing of shares are deducted from additional paid-in capital, net of any related
income tax benefits. Retained earnings include all current and prior period results as disclosed in the
income statement.

**2.14 Trade payables**
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary
course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is
due within one year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest method.


-----

**2.15 Borrowings**
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less
directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

The upfront fees are a part of the borrowing cost and are recognised as an expense in accordance with
the effective interest method.

**2.16 Borrowing costs**
Borrowing costs other than upfront fees are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are
incurred.

**2.17 Current and deferred income tax**
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income
statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or
directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in
equity, respectively.

_(a)_ _Current tax_
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively
enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the company and its subsidiaries operate and
generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect
to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions
where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected
to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.

_(b)_ _Deferred tax_
Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet
date between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting
purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:

– where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or
liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction,
affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
– in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries,
associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary
differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in
the foreseeable future.

Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of
unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be
available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry-forward of unused tax
credits and unused tax losses can be utilized except:

– where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from
the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and,
at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
– in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries,
associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent
that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable
profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.

The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced
to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part
of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are


-----

reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable
that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to
the year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have
been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity
and the same taxation authority.

**2.18 Employee benefits**
**a)** **Pension benefits**
The Group has various post-employment schemes, including both defined benefit and defined
contribution pension plans.

**_Pension obligations_**
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a
separate entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contribution if the fund
does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the
current and prior periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan.

Typically defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit than an employee will receive on
retirement, usually depended on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.

The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present
value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit
credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the
estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are
denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity
approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation. In countries where there is no deep market
in such bonds, the market rates on governments bonds are used.

Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions
are charged or credited in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.

Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income.

For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered
pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further
payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as
employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the
extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.

**b)** **Termination benefits**
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal
retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these
benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits at the earlier of the following dates: a) when the
Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and b) when the entity recognises costs for a
restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 and involves the payment or termination benefits. In the
case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination benefits are measured based
on the number of employees expected to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than 12 months
after the end of the reporting period are discounted to their present value.

**c)** **Profit sharing and bonus plans**
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonus based on a formula that takes into
consideration the agreed terms.


-----

**2.19 Provisions**
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result
of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required
to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where the
Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract,
the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually
certain. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the income statement net of any
reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a
current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting
is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a borrowing cost.

**2.20 Revenue recognition**
Net revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received and represents interest and
amounts receivable for services supplied, stated net of discounts and value added taxes. The Group
recognizes revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured; when it is probable that
future economic benefits will flow to the entity; and when specific criteria have been met for each of the
Group’s activities, as described below.

a)    Commission and debt collection fees in Collection are recognised on collection of the debt
b)    Income from subscription services is recognised proportionally over the duration of the
agreement, usually one year
c)    Income from other services are recognised when the service is provided
d)    Revenue on portfolios of purchased loans and receivables are recognised using the effective
interest method
Purchased loans and receivables consists mainly of portfolios of delinquent consumer debts purchased
at prices significantly below the nominal face value and are recognised according to IAS 39 for loans
and receivables, i.e. at amortised cost using the effective interest method. According to the effective
interest method, the carrying value of each portfolio corresponds to the present value of gross projected
future cash flows discounted by an initial effective interest rate determined on the date the portfolio was
acquired, and the method also allocates the interest revenue over the relevant period. The initial
effective interest rate is based on the relation between acquisition cost and the projected future cash
flows on the acquisition date.

With the projection of future gross cash flows and the purchase price including transaction costs as a
basis, each portfolio is assigned an initial effective interest rate that is then used to discount cash flows
through the life of the portfolio. If appropriate, the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) is reassessed and
adjusted up to 12 months after the purchase of the portfolio of overdue receivables to reflect
refinements made to our estimates of future cash flows based on enhanced data and analysis
considered during that time period. This adjustment has historically not resulted in any material impact
on our income from purchased portfolios.

Current cash flow projections are monitored over the course of the year and updated based on, among
other things, achieved collection results, agreements reached with debtors on instalment plans and
macroeconomic information. Cash flow projections are made at portfolio level, since each portfolio of
receivables consists of homogeneous accounts. On the basis of the updated cash flow projections and
the initial effective interest rate, a new carrying value for the portfolio is calculated at the end of the
reporting period.

Changes over time in the book value can be divided into a time and interest rate component and a
component related to changes in estimates of future cash flows. Changes in cash flow forecasts are
treated symmetrically, i.e., both increases and decreases in forecast flows affect the portfolios’ book
value, and as a result, net revenue.

Income on portfolios is accrued monthly based on each portfolios effective interest rate. Monthly cash
flows greater than the cash flow forecast for the same period is recorded as revenue in the period.
Likewise, monthly cash flows that are less than the monthly cash flow forecast for the same period is
recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period. Compensation received due to price adjustments for
portfolios acquired are recorded as an adjustment to the book value.


-----

**2.21 Leases**
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor
are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income
statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

Leases where the Group assumes substantially all risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the
leased assets are classified as finance leases. The leased assets and the corresponding lease liabilities
(net of finance charges) under finance leases are recognised on the balance sheet as plant and
equipment and borrowings respectively, at the inception of the leases based on the lower of the fair
value of the leased assets and the present value of the minimum lease payments.

Each lease payment is apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding
lease liability. The finance expense is recognised in profit or loss on a basis that reflects a constant
periodic rate of interest on the finance lease liability.

**2.22 Dividend distribution**
Dividends proposed by the Board of Directors are not recorded in the financial statements until they
have been approved by the shareholders at the Shareholder’s General Meeting.

**2.23 Earnings per share**
Basic earnings per share (EPS) are computed by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary
equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the
year.

Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders
of the parent (after reversal of interest on the convertible preference shares) by the weighted average
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary
shares that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary
shares.

**2.24 Related parties**
Parties are related if one party has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise
significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Parties are also
related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence. All transactions between
the related parties are based on the principle of ‘arm’s length’ (estimated market value).

**2.25 Classification in the statement of financial position**
Current assets and short-term liabilities include items due less than one year from the balance sheet
date, and items tied to the operating cycle, if longer. The current portion of long-term debt is included
as current liabilities. Other assets are classified as non-current assets.

**2.26 Cash flow statement**
The indirect method is used for the cash flow statement. For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow
statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined in 2.12.

Cash related to acquisition of portfolios of loans and receivables is included in investing activities while
payments and amortisation on these portfolios are included in operating activities.

**3** **Critical accounting estimates**
Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances.

The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting
estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.


-----

**Estimates and assumptions**
_Revenue recognition Purchased loans and receivables_
The Group uses the effective interest method to account for portfolios and loans. The use of the
effective interest method requires the Group to estimate future cash flows from loans and receivables
at each balance sheet date. The underlying estimates that form the basis for revenue recognition
depends on variables such as the ability to contact the debtor and reach an agreement, timing of cash
flows, general economic environment and statutory regulations. If the estimations are revised, the
Group adjusts the carrying amount of the portfolios and loans to reflect actual and revised estimated
cash flows in accordance with IAS 39 paragraph AG8. Events or changes in assumptions and
managements judgment will affect the recognition of revenue in the period.

_Book value of Purchased loans and receivables_
Loans and receivables (portfolios) consist mainly of acquired non-performing unsecured loans and
non-derivative financial assets without fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market. Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Events or
changes in assumptions and managements judgment will affect the cash flow for the portfolios and
therefore also the net present value of future cash flows and the book value of the portfolios.
See note 14.

_Impairment of goodwill_
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired when circumstances indicate that there may be a
potential impairment. Estimating recoverable amounts of assets and companies are partly based on
management’s evaluation, including estimates of future performance, revenue generating capacity of
the assets, and assumptions of the future market conditions. Changes in circumstances and in
management’s estimation of future events may give rise to impairment losses.

Impairment of goodwill is evaluated on an annual basis and determined by assessing the recoverable
amount of the cash-generating unit (group of cash-generating units), to which the goodwill relates.
Estimating the recoverable amount requires the Group to make assumptions regarding the expected
future cash flow and the discount rate used to calculate the net present value of those cash flows.
See note 12.

_Useful lifetime of brand name_
Brand is originated from the acquisition of Lindorff in 2014 and was measured on initial recognition at
cost. Of the three main approaches to value the brand - Income, Market and Cost, Relief and Royalty –
Income approach was considered to be the most appropriate method for brand valuation.

Brand is assumed to have an indefinite useful life and impairment reviews are undertaken by Group
Management annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential
impairment. See note 11.

_Deferred Income Tax Assets_
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable
profit will be available against which the losses can be utilized. Significant management judgment is
required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely
timing and level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.

The Group is subject to income taxes in some jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in
determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. There are transactions and calculations for which
the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit
issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these
matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current
and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.

**4** **Financial risk management**

**4.1** **Financial risk factors**

_Risk management in Lindorff_
The risk management process in Lindorff Group is based on the bottom up principles; this implies that
risk shall be handled where it arises. The underlying premise of the risk management process is that
Lindorff Group exists to provide value for its stakeholders. Head of Group Treasury has responsibility
for identifying, measuring and controlling financial risk within the Group. Furthermore the Decision
Meeting (DM) process has specific requirements for the risk management in the process, such as for
portfolio investments, etc. The DM-structure is hierarchical in three levels, named 1 to 3. On the highest
level, level 1 (DM1), there is only one occurrence, led by the CEO of the Group. On the second level
there is one DM for each Group function and Group product. On the third level there is one DM
per country. Every DM3 is within the hierarchy of the actual DM2. Significant risk from Group Treasurer
and the DM processes is a part of the overall annually risk assessment.

It is annually performed a documented risk assessment as part of the integrated budget planning
process. In addition to the annually risk assessment as part of the integrated budget planning process
there is also performed risk assessments in the various business process when significant changes
occurs, both related to the business, the organization and more. The Board of Directors in Lindorff
Group annually receives a report on the key risks in Lindorff Group. The risk units report periodically
their unit’s high risks and status on their mitigation plan to the CEO. The risk reporting within the risk
unit and from the risk unit and to the next management/decision level shall be aligned with their existing
management reporting process (such as the DM process, local business reviews, etc.).

Lindorff Group is exposed to financing risk, market risk, currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and
liquidity risk. The risk management guidelines set out in the Group Treasury Policy approved by the
Board of Directors aim to reduce the effect of volatility in financial markets and the potential adverse
effects that can have on the Group’s financial performance.

**_a)_** **_Market risk_**
The services and products offered in the respective local geographical markets are subject to strict local
laws and regulations including requirements for debt collection licenses.

_i)_ _Market and regulatory environment_
The main market risk is related to general macroeconomic conditions and local rules and statutory
regulations in each of the geographical markets the Group is present in and which affect the debtors’
ability to pay and the vendors’ ability and willingness to sell portfolios of loans and receivables and
potential commission from third party collection.

_ii)_ _Foreign exchange risk_
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various
currency exposures, primarily with respect to NOK (Norwegian krone), SEK (Swedish krone) and PLN
(Polish zloty) compared to the Group’s internal and external reporting currency EUR. Foreign exchange
risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments
in foreign operations.

The Group’s strategy is to manage and limit currency risk. The following exchange rates have been
used to translate NOK, SEK, PLN and DKK in the financial accounts:

**NOK** **2016** **2015**
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  ––––––    ––––––
Average..........................................................................................................................   9.29    8.94

**DKK** **2016** **2015**
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  ––––––    ––––––
Average..........................................................................................................................   7.45    7.46
Closing ...........................................................................................................................   7.43    7.46

Foreign exchange exposures can be classified into the following groups:

**Transaction exposure**
Transaction exposures are concentrated to as few Group’s entities as possible in order to create
“natural hedges” where positive exposures are off-set by negative, i.e. incoming foreign currency cash
flows are off-set by outgoing cash flows.

In the operating entities, revenues and operating expenses are mainly denominated in local currencies,
and thus currency fluctuations have only a limited impact on operating earnings. National operations
seldom have receivables and liabilities in foreign currency.

Transaction exposure is hedged when there is a high degree of certainty in terms of the size and timing
of the currency flow.

**Translation exposure**
In 2016 the Group operated in 13 countries. The results and financial position of subsidiaries are
reported in the relevant foreign currencies and later translated into EUR for inclusion in the consolidated
financial statements. Approximately 38% (2015: 42%) of the Group’s revenue is in foreign currency.
Consequently, fluctuations in exchange rates against EUR affect the Group’s revenue and earnings, as
well as equity and other items in the financial statements.

**Economic value exposure**
The relative economic value based on Net sales, Cost of Sales, Operating expenses, EBIT, is exposed
to foreign exchange fluctuations.

The largest relative economic value deriving from non-EUR currencies, are protected by means of
external financing denominated in the corresponding currencies at the same relative currency mix.
Interest payments and debt repayments on bank debt and bonds serve as a natural hedge of future
operating cash flows in the relevant currencies.

The Group’s revenue is distributed by currency as follows:

**1 Jan-31 Dec** **1 Jan-31 Dec**
**EURm** **2016** **2015**
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– –––––––––––– ––––––––––––
EUR .................................................................................................................        404       308
DKK..................................................................................................................         22        23
NOK .................................................................................................................        152       138
SEK..................................................................................................................         59        57
Other currencies ..............................................................................................          9         7
–––––––––––– ––––––––––––
**Total.................................................................................................................        647       534**
–––––––––––– –––––––––––––––––––––––– ––––––––––––
If currencies had weakened/strengthened by 10% in average against the presentation currency EUR
with all other variable held constant, net revenues would have decreased/increased by approximately
EUR 24m (2015: 21m).

**Revenue and debt currency split**

**_b)_** **_Interest rate risk_**
Interest rate risk refers to the risk that the value of cash flow related to financial instruments, interest
bearing assets and liabilities varies due to fluctuations in market interest rates. Currently, Lindorff Group
is in a net debt position and consequently exposed to rising interest rates.

Hedging may be arranged by raising fixed rate debt and by fixing interest rates with derivatives. The
composition of the duration on debt and related derivatives should be a balance between floating
interest rates in order to reduce interest expense over time and fixed interest rates to increase the
stability of interest expense, with the objective of maintaining an optimal weighted average maturity.

As of 31 December 2016 the share of fixed rate debt was 40%. The floating rate debt is tied to the
market rate with quarterly or annually interest fixing. A one percent increase in market interest rates
would have adversely affected net financial items by approximately EUR 14m. A five percent increase
in market interest rates would have adversely affected net financial items by approximately EUR 72m

**_c)_** **_Credit risk_**
Credit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risk is the risk that Lindorff`s counterparties are unable
to fulfil their obligations to the Group. To reduce the risk of having counterparts who are unable to fulfil
their obligations, the Lindorff Group only use counterparts with high credit worthiness for hedging and
cash placement purposes. Counterparts shall be pre-approved by the Board of Directors. An upper limit
is also defined with respect to the size of hedging and cash placement amounts with each counterpart.

Each local entity is responsible for managing and analysing the credit risk for each of their new clients
before standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. Credit risk arises from assets
such as cash and cash equivalents, guarantees and derivative financial instruments and deposits with
banks and financial institutions, as well as outstanding receivables; Purchased loans and receivables
and outlays on behalf of clients. For financial assets owned by Lindorff, no collateral (very limited) or
other credit reinforcements have been received.

The maximum credit exposure for each class of financial assets therefore corresponds to the carrying
amount.

There is also a limited risk of loss linked to the Group’s Third Party Debt Collection, however the risk is
primarily carried by the client.

_Portfolios of purchased loans and receivables_
To minimize the risks related to purchase of non- performing claims, caution is exercised in purchase
decisions. Purchases are usually made from clients with whom the Group has maintained long-term
relationships and therefore has a thorough understanding of the receivables in question. Purchased
loans and receivables are usually purchased at prices significantly below the nominal value of the
receivables, and are not collateralised. Lindorff retains the entire amount collected, including interest
and fees.

Lindorff has high yield requirements on purchased loans and receivables. Before every acquisition, a
careful assessment is made based on a projection of future cash flows (estimated gross collection less
expected costs of collection) from the portfolio. In its calculations, Lindorff is aided by its long
experience in collection management and its valuation models.

Scoring entails the consumer’s payment capacity being assessed with the aid of statistical analysis.
Lindorff therefore believes that it has the expertise required to evaluate these types of receivables.


-----

Purchased portfolios are under constant surveillance by local Debt Purchasing departments, and there
are performed quarterly reviews of the portfolios on Group level based on reports on each portfolio.

Information on acquired loan portfolios is presented in Note 14. Considering that essentially all of
Lindorff’s portfolios are non-performing, age analyses of non-performing loans are, from a risk
perspective, considered to be of limited relevance and are consequently not disclosed. Estimated
Remaining Collection (ERC) is considered as a more important parameter for the Group’s credit risk
management. ERC on Lindorff owned portfolios was EUR 2,641m (2015: 2,442m) as at 31 December
2016.

2016 2015

To facilitate the purchase of larger portfolios at attractive risk levels, Lindorff works in co-operation with
other companies, primarily in Spain and Lithuania. In July 2016 Lindorff established a co-investment
structure in Ireland for purchase of portfolios. In October 2016 Lindorff entered into a strategic
partnership with CarVal Investors and AlbaCore Capital. The partners have committed to deploy up to
EUR 350m in unsecured non-performing loans in Europe. Risks are further diversified by acquiring
receivables from clients in different sectors and different countries.

A share of the investments in purchased loans and receivables has been made as forward flow
agreements (see note 28), meaning that the Group has committed to buy non-performing debt portfolios
for delivery in future periods. The duration of the contracts is usually not more than 12 months and for
the majority of contracts Lindorff has the possibility to decline to acquire the portfolios if the credit quality
of the claims are significant weaker than assumed in the agreement.

The Group’s purchased loans and receivables in 2016 included debtors in 13 countries and the carrying
value is distributed as follows:

Purchased loans and receivables are overdue at acquisition date and therefore usually purchased at
prices significantly below the nominal value. The average claim size at the end of 2016 was
approximately EUR 3,657 (2015: 3,086). Even though it is obvious that the full face value will not be
recovered, the Group has the right to collect the full face value including principal, interest and fees on
its own behalf.

The carrying value of EUR 1,176m as at 31 December 2016, representing approximately 6.1% of face
value, is the maximum theoretical risk if the whole portfolio become worthless/non collectable.

The Group has established long term relationship with large financial institutions in Europe. As a result
the distribution of carrying value of the portfolios of purchased loans and receivables by sector shows
that 87% are claims acquired from Banks and other financial institutions at the end of 2016 (2015: 88%).

The Group has had only minor impairment losses and positive revaluations during the last year.

See note 14 regarding fair value of the portfolios of acquired loans and receivables.


-----

In order to continue minimising the credit risk exposure, Lindorff continues to invest in staff with a broad
experience in credit management, and focus on increased analytical approach to portfolio
assessments. Monitoring processes are implemented to follow up actual collection compared to
forecasts. In addition, the Group’s investment in effective IT systems and a more uniform cross-border
business model will result in better control of the Group’s business, which in turn will also help reduce
the risk of credit loss.

_Trade receivables and other short-term receivables_
Trade receivables and other short-term receivables are exposed to credit risk of counterparties unable
to fulfil their obligations to the Group. Credit risk related to trade receivables and accrued income is
managed in the countries according to the Group’s strategy of risk evaluation of new clients before
standard payment, delivery terms and conditions are offered. We have long term relationship with many
clients and use our operational expertise to monitor and follow up on own receivables in the same way
as for clients.

Payment Services offer payment solution to commercial internet merchants and the Group is exposed
to credit risk of the customers not able to fulfil their obligations to pay. After an initial credit check, the
customer can choose to pay invoice within due date, or convert to payment plans for up to two years.
The credit risk is mainly related to the conversion rate to payment plans. The service is still in ramp up
phase, historical data for conversion rate is not available.

Payment receivables are monitored and collected according to the most efficient collection strategy.

**d)** **Liquidity risk**
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group does not have the ability to fulfil its payment obligations.
The Group’s long-term financing risk is minimized through long term financing in the form of committed
lines of credit. As of 31 December the Group held unused facilities totalling EUR 276m.

To guarantee short-term solvency, Lindorff Group should have liquid assets at disposal, a liquidity
reserve, covering minimum 1.5 months of disbursements. The liquidity reserve is defined as bank
balances or invested funds that can be released within two banking days without any additional or minor
cost, plus any unutilized credit facilities, committed for minimum 12 months, less any outstanding
uncommitted debt.

Cash forecasting is performed by the operating entities of the Group and aggregated by Group
Treasury. Group Treasury monitors rolling forecasts to ensure that the Group has sufficient cash to meet
operational and financial expenditures, while also monitoring that borrowing limits and covenants in the
Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and Bond documentation are adhered to.

In order to increase flexibility and improve the cash efficiency, an overlay cash pooling structure is put
in place within the Group. The cash pool structure secures that the operating entities have sufficient
liquidity to cover working capital needs, while also securing that excess liquidity is transferred to the
Group. Excess liquidity is used to repay drawings under the revolving credit facilities, and/or
(if applicable) is invested at low risk in accordance with investment rules set forth in the Group Treasury
Policy.

The table below shows the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities and net settled derivative financial
liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining periods at the balance sheet date to
the contractual maturity date. Derivative financial liabilities are included in the analysis if their
contractual maturities are essential for an understanding of the timing of the cash flows.

**4.2** **Capital management**
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a
going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. In order
to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to
shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.

The credit ratio is calculated as Net Interest Bearing Debt divided by LTM Adjusted EBITDA adjusted
for Non-Recurring Items and pro forma effect (if applicable) of carve-outs and M&A’s. Net Interest
Bearing Debt is calculated as outstanding bond debt and drawings on the SS Revolving Credit Facility
less cash and cash equivalents. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA adjusted for amortisation
and revaluation of portfolios of purchased loans and receivables.

The credit ratio as at 31 December 2016 was 5.0x (2015: 5.7x).

The Group has been assigned a credit rating of B+ by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services and B2 by
Moody’s Investor Services.

**5** **Segment information**
Management has determined the operating segments based on information reviewed by management for
the purpose of allocating resources and assessing performance. Management considers the performance
from a product perspective and separately considers the Debt Purchasing and Debt Collection. The Debt
Purchasing segment consists of acquisition and management of mainly unsecured non-performing loans
and receivables. The Debt Collection segment consists of collection for various clients and on portfolios
of loans and receivables owned by Debt Purchasing as well as Real Estate Servicing.

Both segments meet the quantitative thresholds required by IFRS 8 for reportable segments.
Management assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of Contribution
Margin 1 which is gross revenues minus direct operating expenses.


-----

**Revenue**
Sales between segments are carried out at arm’s length. The revenue from external parties reported to
management is measured in a manner consistent with that in the income statement .The following table
presents a reconciliation of the reportable segments’ main captions from profit and loss to the entity’s
profit and loss before tax:

Effective tax rate...........................................................................................     263%         28%

The income tax expense was EUR 30m (2015: negative EUR 6m) including net tax expense of
EUR 17m relating to the disputed tax claims described below. The high effective tax rate, adjusted for
the issues describe below, is mainly due to net financing costs including unrealised currency losses in
Sweden for which the Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset.

Lindorff Group has certain ongoing tax cases related to deductibility of interest of group internal loans
in Finland and Norway. Tax exposure of these cases including potential penalties is estimated at
EUR 44m, whereof EUR 12m remains unpaid as at 31 December 2016. Lindorff contests whole or part
of the claims in both countries. Lindorff has deemed it probable that these litigation processes may have
a negative outcome and a tax liability representing the best estimate of the potential negative outcome
less taxes paid has been provided for in the consolidated statement of financial position.


-----

Furthermore at acquisition of Lindorff in 2014 an indemnification right for the buyer (Lock AS), related
to the tax exposure in the Group, was included in the Share Purchase Agreement (SPA). It was agreed
that the majority sellers will indemnify the acquirer for 75% of any negative outcome in the specific tax
disputes described above, capped at a maximum amount of EUR 29m. Lindorff has in accordance with
the terms of the SPA notified the sellers that it will utilize the indemnification right in case of a negative
outcome.

In accordance with IFRS 3 any indemnification right recorded should be measured on the same basis
as the liability. Based on the terms in the SPA described above the indemnification asset recorded was
estimated at EUR 28m, resulting in a net tax expense in the consolidated income statement of
EUR 17m related to these cases. The Group has reassigned the right to receive the cash under the
indemnity agreement to Lock TopCo AS’ parent company Cidron 1748 S.à r.l. and the consideration for
this reassignment was recorded as a receivable on the shareholder of the Group. In the consolidated
statement of financial position the previous indemnification asset is therefore now classified as a
receivable of EUR 28m towards its shareholder Lock Upper Holding AS. The receivable is no longer
linked to the tax indemnity and any positive outcome of these cases in the court system will stay within
the Group.

The group has operations in a number of countries with different tax rates:

**Expectations regarding effective tax rate**
The Group is subject to varying income tax rates depending on local tax regulations in the relevant
country; hence Lindorff’s operations are subject to effective tax rates ranging from 15% to significantly
above the nominal tax rates. Several countries have implemented interest limitations rules which may
increase the effective tax rate going forward. This may be offset somewhat with lower nominal tax rates.
In some periods, tax losses (and interest) carried forward that are not recognised in the statement of
financial position will cause variations in the effective tax rate. In periods, when such assets are not
recognised, the effective tax rate will be higher than the long-term expectation, whereas it may be lower
in period when tax losses not recognised as assets have been utilised.

Deferred income tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that the realisation
of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are offset within the same tax jurisdiction.

The Group has substantial tax losses brought forward in the end of 2016. These have to a large extent
been generated by interest on shareholder loans in to the Lindorff Group prior to the acquisition in
October 2014.

**10** **Fixtures and furniture**
Carrying value of fixtures and furniture was EUR 14m as at 31 December 2016 (2015: 14m).
Investments in fixtures and fittings were EUR 4m and additional EUR 1m were taken over through
acquisition of Aktua and Cross Factor (2015: 2m); the depreciation was EUR 4m (2015: 3m).

The assets are depreciated over the estimated useful lives which are usually considered to be
3-5 years.

Capitalised expenditure for IT development is mainly generated internally using our own employees
and/or contracted consultants.

Brand and goodwill (see note 12) are acquired in connection with business acquisitions. Client relations
include the rights related to collection contracts with a third party, and are amortised straight line over
their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful life corresponds to the contract period (maximum
10 years). Increase on client relationships in the reporting period of EUR 72m is due to investments of
EUR 8m (2015: 23 m), addition of client relationship in Aktua EUR 127m and period depreciation and
impairment of EUR 62m, whereof EUR 30m relates to impairment of a Debt Collection client servicing
contract in Spain. The reason for the write-down was that volumes had been lower than anticipated.
Collection performance had however been in line with the business case. The contract lifetime is
10 years and the lower volume may be compensated at a later stage.

Brand value related to acquisition of Lindorff Group in 2014 amounting to EUR 83m is recognised as
an intangible asset. Brand is considered having an indefinite useful life time and is not amortised. The
value is tested for impairment on a yearly basis together with goodwill.

Amortisation of intangible assets having a definite useful life time is included in “depreciation and
amortisation” costs for the year in income statement.

Lindorff has two major business areas: (i) Debt Collection, consisting of debt-related administrative
services and (ii) Debt Purchasing. Book value of goodwill at 31 December 2016 as at EUR 1,584m is
allocated to Debt Collection segment.

Goodwill related to Lindorff acquisition in October 2014 was identified at EUR 1,416m.


-----

_Valuation of Debt Collection_
Forecasted revenues comprise estimated revenues from 3PC (Third Party Collection) and IDC (Internal
Debt Collection) based on historical growth with declined growth towards the end of period. Forecasted
operating expenses relate to staff cost in Debt Collection operations. Based on estimated depreciation
and amortisation, tax rate of 25%, WACC of 6.38% and terminal growth of 1%, the business enterprise
value of Debt Collection segment is estimated at EUR 2,510m.

_Brand name_
Lindorff brand is well known and respected and ensures us to be invited to participate in competitive
tender offers we otherwise might not be eligible to. Value of brand name is estimated by a royalty based
model, assuming a royalty rate of 1.5% net of maintenance and administration cost. Based on a
discount rate of 7% the brand name value is estimated at EUR 83m with an indefinite useful lifetime.
Value is tested annually for impairment together with goodwill.

_Database_
Statistic databases allow Lindorff to do qualified debt purchasing decisions as well as improve
profitability in Debt Collection. The value of database related to Debt Purchase is included in the fair
value of portfolios. Value of database related to Debt Collection is highly connected to the competence
of our employees and is hard to separate from the value of workforce. The value of database is
estimated to be non-material and is not recognised as a separate intangible asset.

_Workforce_
Under current IFRS 3, workforce cannot be recognised as an asset separable from goodwill. As
Lindorff’s business model depends on attract, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled employees,
the workforce is considered of material value. Based on assumptions of recruiting cost, training cost,
efficiency cost of hiring new people compared to experienced staff members, Lindorff estimates the
value of the workforce in each business combination transaction and reported and annually tested for
impairment as part of goodwill.

_Goodwill allocated at acquisition of Casus Group_
Acquisition price of Casus Finanse in Poland August 2015 was EUR 35m. Based on the purchase price
and fair value valuation of identified assets and liabilities, goodwill was estimated at EUR 29m. Like
Lindorff, Casus group has two major business areas: i) Debt Collection, consisting of debt-related
administrative services and (ii) Debt Purchasing.

The purchase price allocation procedure reconciles the transaction values with projected future cash
flow from the segments. The identified intangible assets in Poland are related to Debt Collection
segment, in all material aspects.

_Goodwill allocated at acquisition of Aktua Group_
Acquisition price of Aktua Group in Spain in June 2016 was EUR 134m. Purchase price allocated to
assets and liabilities at fair value led to goodwill at EUR 127m. Aktua’s services comprise Third Party
Collection and Real Estate Servicing, both within Debt Collection segment. Goodwill is accordingly
allocated to Debt Collection segment.

_Goodwill allocated at acquisition of HIT/DMV_
Acquisition price of debt collection companies DMV Debitorenmanagement-und
Verwaltungsgesellschaft mbH and HIT Hanseatische Inkasso-Treuhand GmbH in Germany in
November 2016 was EUR 12m. Purchase price allocated to assets and liabilities at fair value led to
goodwill of EUR 9m, allocated to Debt Collection segment.

See note 29 Business combinations for further information.

_Impairment testing of goodwill and brand name as at 31 December 2016_
Goodwill is tested for impairment on yearly basis by comparing recoverable amount with carrying value.
Recoverable amount has been determined by value in use based on management estimates of future
cash flow for the period 2017 – 2020 (2015: the period 2016 – 2019) approved by the Board, average


-----

growth of 8% (2015: 7%) in the measurement period, terminal growth rate of 1% (2015: 3%), tax rate
of 25% (2015: 25%) and WACC of 6.38% (2015: 6.53%). Management’s approach to determining the
value assigned to each key assumption is based on management’s past experience. The value of Debt
Collection segment is EUR 2,510m (2015: EUR 1,953m). Carrying value of Debt Collection segment is
net of operational segment assets, recognised at EUR 1,908m (2015: EUR 1,677m) including value of
brand. No impairment was identified.

Determination of WACC for goodwill impairment testing:

_Risk free rate_
Goodwill is denominated mainly in EUR, but also partly in NOK and a minor part in PLN. The risk free
rate used in the calculation of the WACC is based on the EUR risk free interest rate, which on
31 December was priced at 0.68%. However, the Group has a significant part of the cash flows in other
different currencies, the largest being NOK and SEK. The respective 10 year government bond for
these currencies range from 0.68% for EUR, 1.66% for NOK and 0.55% for SEK. Given the fluctuations
in the yield for these bonds we deem it reasonable to use the EUR risk free rate as basis for the risk
free rate for the Group. Calculating a currency specific WACC for each currency, the risk free rate
element would have increased the WACC slightly compared to the WACC estimated for the Group.

_Risk premium_
Based on available market information related to CMS business, the long-term risk premium is about
6.4%.

_Equity Beta_
The equity beta is based on 5 years of weekly observations for market peers. The calculations are
based on data from Bloomberg. We have then used this as a basis for our Beta relevered.

The Group’s exposure to various risks associated with the financial instruments is discussed in note 4.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporting period is the carrying amount of each
class of financial asset mentioned above.

**13 (b)** **Credit quality of financial assets**
The credit quality of financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired can be assessed by
reference to external credit ratings (if available) or to historical information about counterparty default
rates.

**_Purchased loans and receivables — See note 4 and 14._**

_Trade receivables_
The Group’s trade receivables are related to clients in various industries and regions. The Group’s
largest client accounts for less than 7% of revenues in 2016. Most accounts receivable outstanding are
with customers known to the Group and whose creditworthiness is good and Lindorff has historically
had very limited losses on such receivables.

_Other short-term receivables_
Other short-term receivables consist mainly of accrued income not invoiced, payment services
receivables and fee outlay, where customer is bearing the risk. It also includes short-term restricted
deposit and other receivables, where credit risk is considered to be low.

**14** **Purchased loans and receivables**
Purchased loans and receivables are classified as loans and receivables and are recognised at
amortised cost according to the effective interest method.

The Group determines the carrying value by calculating the present value of estimated future cash flows
at the receivables’ initial effective interest rate. Adjustments are recognised in the income statement. In
the company’s opinion, the market’s yield requirements in the form of effective interest rates on new
portfolios have remained fairly constant despite turbulence in global financial markets in recent years.
The valuation method used results in the best estimate of the fair value of debt portfolios.

The carrying value of Purchased loans and receivables recognised at amortised cost does not perfectly
match the fair value determined by discounting the net cash flow i.e. the gross cash receipts reduced
by the cost to collect discounted with a market based discount rate at every end of the reporting period.
The method and result of the fair value estimation as at 31 December is illustrated below and shows a
non-significant deviation between the two valuation methods. The method falls within level 3 of the fair
value hierarchy.

**_Fair value estimation of portfolios of purchased debt and receivables_**
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (e.g. loans and
receivables) is determined by using valuation techniques such as net present value of estimated cash
flows. For loans and receivables, the discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital, which
is the weighted value of the Group’s cost of debt and the cost of equity. The cost of equity is estimated
by applying the capital asset pricing model.

The preparation of cash flow estimates requires significant estimates to be made by management
regarding future cash flows from portfolios. The estimated future portfolio cash flows are reviewed by
management each quarter. The fair value is estimated to be approximately EUR 1,193m (2015:
1,126m) and is based on net future estimated cash flows after tax, discounted with the estimated
WACC. The corresponding carrying amount is EUR 1,176m (2015: 1,070m), which is based on IAS 39
using the estimated gross future cash flows, where the discount factor is the individual IRR for the each
portfolio. The future cash flow forecasts used to estimate the fair market value are the same as the cash
flow forecast used in the accounting for loans and receivables at 31 December 2016.

The fair value estimation is based on estimated annual net cash flows from portfolios. The estimated
annual net cash flows from portfolios is the assumed annual future collection on portfolios per country,
less assumed annual collection costs per portfolio before tax. Collection costs consist of operational
costs in the portfolio segment, i.e. commission to Debt Collection, payroll expenses, premises,
communication costs and other costs directly attributable to the Debt Purchasing segment. The
collection costs as a percentage of the portfolio collection differ from portfolio to portfolio, ranging from
5.0% to over 50.0%.

In addition, the country specific marginal tax rate is applied. This individual collection cost and tax rate
is applied to each portfolio’s estimated future cash flow, adding up to an estimated total net cash flow
for the Group.

The weighted average cost of capital after tax for the portfolio segment is estimated to 10.5% (2015:
12%) as at 31 December 2016 (details of the calculation is shown below). Based on this rate, the
discounted value of the estimated net cash flows indicates that the fair value of portfolios is
approximately EUR 1,193m (2015: 1,126m).

To evaluate this calculation, a sensitivity analysis of the cash flow estimates is presented in the table
below in order to see the effect of deviations to the cash flow estimates and variations in the cost of
capital.

The cost of capital after tax for the Portfolio segment is calculated using the capital asset pricing model
(CAPM) in combination with the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Based on the variables from
the table below, the estimated cost of capital after tax is approximately 10.5%.

_Risk free rate_
The risk free rate used in the calculation of the WACC is based on the EUR risk free interest rate, which
on 31 December was priced at 0.68%. However, the Group has a significant part of the cash flows in
other different currencies, the largest being NOK and SEK. The respective 10 year government bond
for these currencies range from 0.68% for EUR, 1.66% for NOK and 0.55% for SEK. Given the
fluctuations in the yield for these bonds we deem it reasonable to use the EUR risk free rate as basis
for the risk free rate for the Group. Calculating a currency specific WACC for each currency, the risk
free rate element would have increased the WACC slightly compared to the WACC estimated for the
Group.

_Risk premium_
Based on empirical research done the long-term risk premium is about 6.0%. It is reasonable to assume
that the risk of investing in non-performing loan portfolios is higher than observed average market risk
premium. Therefore a small cap risk premium of 9.74% is added to the calculation – resulting in a total
risk premium of 15.74%. These risk premiums are based on the research found by Ilbbotson Risk
Premiums Over time Report

_Equity Beta_
The equity beta is based on 5 years of weekly observations for market peers. The calculations are
based on data from Bloomberg. We have then used this as a basis for our Beta relevered.

_Future cash flow estimates_
The future cash flow estimates are based on the current 15 year IFRS forecast for the current asset
base with no value after this 15 year period. Therefore there are no adding cash flows from future
investments included in the fair value estimation.

**Bonds and liabilities to credit institutions**
Lindorff Group is funded through a Super Senior RCF of EUR 345m, Senior Secured Notes of
EUR 1,467m equivalent (issued in EUR and NOK) and Senior Notes of EUR 444m equivalent (issued
in EUR and SEK). In October 2016 Lindorff secured additional funding through a EUR 200m
non-syndicated loan facility and a EUR 55m equivalent bilateral credit facility, entered into by Lock
Lower Holding AS and Lindorff Capital AS, respectively. The Group also secured a receivable financing
solution in July 2016 of up to EUR 50m.

The average interest rate on the notes is 6.87% with an average duration of 4.5 years. The
multicurrency RCF is priced at a margin of 3.5% with a commitment fee equivalent to 35% of the
applicable margin on any undrawn amount. At the end of Q4 2016, the RCF draw amounted to
EUR 44m (excluding a draw for unfunded guarantees of EUR 11m). The non-syndicated loan facility
bears interest at an initial rate of EURIBOR plus 5.50%, subject to margin increases over time.
Obligations under the facility rank equal in right of payment with the Senior Notes and is secured by a
pledge over the shares of Lock Lower Holding AS, and second priority pledges over the shares in Lock
AS and in certain intercompany receivables of Lock Lower Holding AS. The EUR 55m eq. bilateral credit
facility bears interest at NIBOR plus a margin of 4.50%. The facility is unsecured. The receivable
financing solution carries a margin of 2.90% over the interbank rate and EUR 35m was drawn at the
end of the quarter.

In addition to the above mentioned borrowings, Aktua has senior facilities totalling EUR 98m,
Mezzanine facilities totalling EUR 50m, and a PIK loan of EUR 30m. The bonds issued by Lindorff S.A.
in Poland (previously Casus Finanse S.A.) were repaid in full in December 2016.

The covenants set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Agreement and the Senior Notes Agreement are
typical for 144A / Reg S high yield issue of this type, including but not limited to the following: Change
of Control, Debt Incurrence, Permitted Liens, Limitation on Sales of Assets & Subsidiary Stock,
Limitation on Affiliate Transactions, Limitation on Restricted Payments, Anti-layering, Reports, Merger
and Consolidation, Line of Business and Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment
Grade Status.

The SSRCF Agreement, the non-syndicated loan agreement and the bilateral facility agreement
contains certain of the incurrence covenants that are set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Agreement
and the Senior Notes Agreement. In addition, the SSRCF Agreement contains a Drawn Super Senior
Leverage Ratio financial covenant which will be tested for each annual accounting period and quarterly
on a rolling twelve month basis; the financial covenant is set to 2:1 and is calculated as Drawn Super
Senior Indebtedness to Adjusted EBITDA. The Aktua facilities also contain two financial covenants that
are measured on a quarterly basis; a cash flow coverage ratio of minimum 1.15x (Cash Flow / Debt
Service) and a Leverage Ratio of maximum 4.50x (Net Debt / EBITDA).

**Security package**
Companies of the Group representing more than 80% of consolidated EBITDA and assets for the year
ended December 31, 2016 have provided security for the SSRCF and the Bond package through
pledges of shares, bank accounts, receivables and a guarantee for the commitments under the SSRCF
and the Bond Package. Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the liens securing the Senior Secured
Notes will be senior liens over the Senior Secured Notes Collateral that rank equally with the liens that
secure: (i) on a super-priority basis (A) obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and
(B) obligations under certain super-priority hedging arrangements; and (ii) on an equal and ratable
basis, (A) certain other future debt permitted to be incurred under the Senior Secured Indenture,
including certain acquisition indebtedness and (B) obligations under certain hedging arrangements. The
Senior Notes will be secured by the Shared Collateral on a second-ranking basis and by the Senior
Notes Only Collateral on a first-ranking basis.

**Planned refinancing**
The merger between Intrum Justitia and Lindorff announced on November 14, 2016 is subject to the
approval of regulatory authorities in relevant jurisdictions as well as by the EU competition authorities.
The transaction is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2017, depending on the time
required to obtain the regulatory approvals. If the transaction is completed as planned, substantially all


-----

of Lindorff’s indebtedness, including the senior secured and senior notes and the RCF, will be
refinanced.

not significant. The fair value is based on unobservable inputs not corroborated by market data and is
within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Provisions at year-end 2016 amounted to EUR 10m (2015: 1m). EUR 9m relates to earn out (based on
2017 results) provision related to acquisition of Aktua.

Other long-term liabilities amounted to EUR 10m (2015: 0m), of which EUR 9m relates to a liability
towards associated company.

The full fair value of the derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity
is more than 12 months, and as a current asset or liability, if the maturity is less than 12 months.

**26** **Post-employment benefits**
The Group has pension liabilities for certain employees from defined benefit plans in Norway. The major
plans are covered by assets in funds administrated by insurance companies. The plans are final salary
pension plans, which provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable
for a specific number of years. The level of benefits provided depends on members’ length of service
and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement. The plans in Lindorff have been closed to
new employees since 2006. Pensions for new employees are instead based on defined contribution
plans.

The defined benefit plan in Norway was terminated with an effective date 31 December 2016. The only
remaining members are the ones that were on sick leave on the cancellation date.

The pension costs and pension liabilities for the defined benefit plans are presented below.

The plan assets consist primarily of investments in listed bonds. Due to the low net exposure there
would not be a significant impact on the financial position of the company due to reasonable changes
in the actuarial assumptions.

The main actuarial assumptions are as follows:

**Pension insurance with Alecta, Sweden**
Retirement pension and family pension obligations for salaried employees in Sweden are secured
through pension insurance with Alecta. For the 2016 fiscal year, the company did not have access to
such information that would enable the company to record this plan as a defined benefit plan.
Consequently, the ITP pension plan secured through insurance with Alecta is recorded as a defined
contribution plan. The Group’s level of participation in the plan is insignificant.

**Germany**
In addition there is a defined benefit plan for 8 employees in Germany. The net value of the plan is
negative and EUR 616k (2015: 35k) is recognised as a defined benefit liability.


-----

**27** **Pledged assets, contingent assets and liabilities**
The external funding of the Group is secured through Lock AS and Lock Lower Holding AS.

Companies of the Group representing more than 80% of EBITDA and assets as of 31 December 2016
have provided security for the RCF and the Bond package through pledge of shares, bank accounts,
receivables and a guarantee for the commitments under the RCF and the Bond package.

When conducting their business, the Group companies are from time to time obliged to provide bank
guarantees to various government bodies or business parties. Such guarantees are backed by a
guarantee facility, which is part of the Group’s funding through Lock AS. The guarantee facility amounts
to EUR 25m, where EUR 11m was utilized as of 31 December 2016.

The book value of the share pledge amounts to:

**EURm** **31 Dec 2016** **31 Dec 2015**

Cash and cash equivalents .......................................................................         16           40

As of 31 December 2016 there were no contingent assets.

**Contingent liabilities:**
During the normal business operations, the Group faces from time to time claims in civil lawsuits and
disputes, most of which involve relatively limited amounts. Provision for contingent liabilities as at
31 December 2016 is EUR 4m.

**28** **Commitments**

**(a)** **Capital commitments**
Capital expenditure contracted for at the end of the reporting period but not yet incurred is as follows:

**EURm** **31 Dec 2016** **31 Dec 2015**
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– ––––––––––   ––––––––––

The Group has committed to buy non-performing debt portfolios for delivery in future periods; these
commitments are from “forward flow” contracts and – for Poland - an investment fund in which we have
obligated ourselves to become owner of total fund over time. Estimated Capital Expenditure is based
on previous acquisitions under the same contracts and client’s expectations.

**(b)** **Operating lease commitments—Group company as lessee**
The Group leases various offices under non-cancellable operating lease agreements. The lease terms
are between 5 and 10 years, and the majority of lease agreements are renewable at the end of the
lease period at market rate.

The Group also leases various cars and machinery under cancellable operating lease agreements. The
Group is required to give a six-month notice for the termination of these agreements. The lease
expenditure charged to the income statement during the year is disclosed under other operating costs.

The future aggregated minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as
follows:

**_HIT & DMV_**
On 30 November 2016, Lindorff acquired DMV Debitorenmanagement-und Verwaltungsgesellschaft
mbH (DMV) and HIT Hanseatische Inkasso-Treuhand GmbH (HIT) in Germany. With these acquisitions
Lindorff increased its Debt Collection capacity in the German market. HIT was established in 1983 and
has over 50 employees based in Hamburg. DMV is offering services to HIT and has 12 FTEs.

The acquisition price for DMV and HIT was EUR 12m. Purchase price was allocated to assets and
liabilities at fair value and led to goodwill of EUR 9m.

There is always some uncertainty associated with future cash flow and collection cost estimates as
basis for fair value estimation as at acquisition date. The purchase price allocation is to be considered
as a preliminary assessment and may be reallocated within 12 months after the acquisition.

**_Aktua_**
On 1 June 2016, Lindorff acquired 94% of the Spanish collection group Aktua Soluciones Financieras
Holdings. In July the ownership of Aktua decreased to 85% as minority interest shareholder Banco
Santander acquired an additional 9% stake from Lindorff. Aktua is a leading multi-client servicer
focused on secured debt and real estate assets in Spain offering end-to-end services across the entire
NPL and RES value chain, including loan servicing, real estate services as well as investment advisory
of financial institutions and international investors. The group was founded in 2008 and has a staff of
more than 400 employees and a network of 22 offices and field collection teams across the country.


-----

The company holds long term contracts with leading financial institutions in Spain, and gives Lindorff a
strong platform in the RES market and brings new capabilities to pursue further growth in the secured
non-performing loans area in Spain and subsequently in other markets.

The acquisition price for Aktua group was EUR 134m including deferred and contingent consideration.
Purchase price allocated to assets and liabilities at fair value led to goodwill at EUR 127m.

There is always some uncertainty associated with future cash flow and cost estimates as basis for fair
value estimation as at acquisition date. The purchase price allocation is to be considered as a
preliminary assessment and may be reallocated within 12 months after the acquisition.

Information related to revenue and profit or loss for the combined entity according to IFRS 3 B.64 for
2016 as if all business combinations had occurred at 1 January 2016 is impractical to report. Part of the
business combinations was an asset acquisition with no previous separate financial reporting available.

For the period 1 June – 31 December 2016 key financials for Aktua group consolidated within Lindorff
Group were: Net revenue EUR 69m, EBITDA EUR 37m and EBIT EUR 27m.

**_Acquisition of Casus Finanse S.A. in Poland_**
On 18 August 2015, Lindorff acquired Casus Finanse (changed name to Lindorff S.A group in March
2016), one of the largest Credit Management Services (CMS) players in Poland. With this acquisition
Lindorff expands its geographical footprint in Europe.

The purchase price for Casus Finanse was EUR 35m.

The allocation of the purchase price to assets and liabilities at fair value led to recognition of goodwill
at EUR 29m.

Casus Finanse was established in 1997 and has a long term experience in serving the Polish CMS
market. Like Lindorff, Casus group has two major business areas: Debt Collection, consisting of debtrelated administrative services and Debt Purchasing.

Lindorff expects synergy effects from Casus’ knowledge of the market combined with Lindorff’s
business model for collection performances. The workforce of approximately 500 FTEs is considered
of material value. Based on assumptions of recruiting cost, training cost, efficiency cost of hiring new
people compared to experienced staff members, Lindorff estimates the value of the workforce to be
significant.

Valuation of purchased loans and receivables based on information available at purchase date was
EUR 23m. Prediction of future cash flows in new entities is connected with significant uncertainty,
especially when entering new markets.

as at 31 December 2015. A provision of EUR 1.3m is recorded as at 31 December 2016.

**Alternative performance**
**measures (APMs)**


**Definitions**

APMs are used by Lindorff for annual and interim financial
reporting as we consider them to be important supplemental
measures of our performance and believe that the alternative
performance measures are useful for users of the financial
report as a complement to assess the possibility of a dividend, to
implement strategic investment, and to assess the Group’s
ability to meet financial commitments. These measures are
adjusted IFRS measures defined, calculated and used in a
consistent and transparent manner over the years and across
the company as relevant. We believe that these metrics are
helpful in understanding our performance from period to period
and facilitate comparison with our peers. The non-IFRS financial
measures should not be viewed as substitutes for revenue, other
income, results from operating activities (EBIT), profit/(loss) for
the period, cash flows from operating activities at period end or
other income statement or cash flow items computed in
accordance with IFRS.


**Adjusted EBITDA** EBITDA adjusted for amortisation and revaluation of portfolios of
purchased loans and receivables. We use Adjusted EBITDA as
a measure of our operating cash flow generation and the liquidity
of our business.

**Adjusted EBITDA (excl. NRIs)** EBITDA adjusted for amortisation and revaluation of portfolios of
purchased loans and receivables excluding non-recurring items.
This is a measure that the Group considers to be relevant for
investors who want to understand the results from operating
activities adjusted for amortisation and revaluation respective
the generation of earnings adjusted for before non-recurring
items.

**Average number of FTE’s** Average number of employees during the year converted to fulltime posts. The calculation is based on the total average number
of employees per month divided by the number of months in the
period.

**Direct opex** Operational expenses related to collection activities, excluding
SG&A and IT cost.

**ERC** Estimated Remaining Collections next 180 months on
purchased loans and receivables in Debt Purchasing. ERC is
calculated as of a point in time, assuming no additional
purchases are made thereafter. These expectations are based
on historical and current portfolio collection performance data,
and trends and assumptions about future debt collection rates.


**Gross collections on**
**purchased loans and**
**receivables**


Gross collection on purchased loans and receivables means the
total principal, interest, collection fees and legal fees received on
portfolios that we own.


**Intersegment Revenue** Commission to the Debt Collection segment from the Debt
Purchasing segment.

**Investments in Debt Purchasing** Acquisitions of non-performing loans and receivables (may differ
from acquisition of loans and receivables in the cash flow
statement due to actual payment of the acquisition may be due
in another period).

**NIBD** Interest bearing debt less cash. See reconciliation in note 4.2.


-----

**NIBD/Proforma Adjusted**
**EBITDA (LTM)**


Net interest bearing debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA LTM
(Leverage ratio is adjusted for proforma effect of acquisitions in
the given period. Not including investments in Debt Purchasing).
This ratio is a debt ratio that shows how many years it would take
for Lindorff to pay back its debt if net debt and EBITDA are held
constant. See reconciliation of NIBD/Proforma Adjusted EBITDA
(LTM) in note 4.2.


**Portfolio revaluation** Change in carrying value of purchased loans and receivables
due to changed collection forecasts.

**Restricted Group** Lock Lower Holding AS and all its subsidiaries subject to the
restrictive covenants of the Senior Secured Notes, Senior Notes
and RCF indenture.

**Return in Debt Purchasing** Last Twelve Months (LTM) segment earning in % of average
book value of purchased loans and receivables for the last
twelve months.

**Segment Earnings** Segment earnings are calculated on a segment basis, and
means the total operating revenue of the segment less the direct
operating expenses attributable to the respective segment.

**Segment Earnings Debt Collection Includes earnings from collection on own portfolios and third**
party debt.

### Independent auditor’s report

**Report on the Financial Statements**
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Lock Lower Holding AS, which comprise the
financial statements of the parent company and the financial statements of the group. The financial
statements of the parent company comprise the balance sheet as at 31 December 2015, and the
income statement, statement of changes in equity and cash flow statement, for the year then ended,
and a summary of significant policies and other explanatory information. The financial statements of the
group comprise the balance sheet at 31 December 2015, income statement, statement of
comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flow for the year then ended, and a summary of
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

**_The Board of Directors and the Managing Director’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements_**
The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the preparation and fair
presentation of the financial statements of the parent company in accordance with the Norwegian
Accounting Act and accounting standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, and for the
preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements of the group in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by EU and for such internal control as the
Board of Directors and the Managing Director determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

**_Auditor’s Responsibility_**
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices
generally accepted in Norway, including International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require
that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s
preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting
policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We belive that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit opinion.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements**

**1    General information**
The parent company Lock Lower Holding AS is a registered company domiciled in Oslo, Norway with
office address at Hoffsveien 70B, 0377 Oslo, Norway. The company is 100% owned by Lock Upper
Holding AS, Hoffsveien 70B, 0377 Oslo. The ultimate parent is Cidron 2013 Ltd, 26 Esplanade, St Helier
Jersey JE2 3QA.

Lock Lower Holding AS (the company) and its subsidiaries (together the Group) have two core business
segments; Debt Purchasing and Debt Collection. The Debt Purchasing segment consists of the
acquisition, management and collection of unsecured non-performing loans. The Third Party Debt
Collection segment consists of contingency collection for various clients. Other services include invoice
and payment services.

The Group has offices in 13 countries—Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway,
Poland, Spain, Sweden, Russia and the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania).

The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the period ended 31 December 2015 were
authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Board of Directors on 28 April 2016 and
presented to the Annual General Meeting on the same date.

**2    Summary of significant accounting policies**
**2.1  Basis of preparation**
The consolidated financial statements of Lock Lower Holding AS and all its subsidiaries have been
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as approved by the EU
and interpretations set by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the annual
accounts act.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying
the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or
areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are
disclosed in note 3.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for financial
derivatives that have been measured at fair value through profit or loss.

The parent company’s functional currency is in Norwegian Krone (NOK) and the presentation currency
for the parent company and for the Group is Euro (EUR). The consolidated financial statements are
presented in EUR and all values are rounded to the nearest m (EURm) except when otherwise
indicated. The consolidated and parent company accounts pertain to 1 January to 31 December for
income statements and 31 December for items on the statements of financial position.

_2.1.1 Changes in accounting policy and disclosures_
Financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2015 are the second financial statement for
Lock Lower Holding AS Group. For information regarding Lindorff previous years see Lindorff First
Holding AB Annual report 2013.

The Group has adopted all new and revised standards and interpretations issued by IASB and IFRIC
and approved by EU if relevant to the business and come into force for the accounting year starting 1
January 2015.

_2.1.1 New standards and interpretations not yet adopted_
Certain new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations that are effective for annual
periods beginning after 1 January 2015 have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial
statements. None of these are expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial
statements of the group. Below is a short description of the new standards and interpretations:


-----

IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the classification, measurement and de-recognition of
financial assets and financial liabilities and introduces new rules for hedge accounting. In July 2014, the
IASB made further changes to the classification and measurement rules and also introduced a new
impairment model. The new standard replaces the parts of IAS 39 that relate to the classification and
measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified into
two measurement categories: those measured as at fair value and those measured at amortised cost.
The determination is made at initial recognition.

The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing its financial instruments and the
contractual cash flow characteristics of the instrument. For financial liabilities, the standard retains most
of the IAS 39 requirements. The main change is that, in cases where the fair value option is taken for
financial liabilities, the part of a fair value change due to an entity’s own credit risk is recorded in other
comprehensive income rather than the income statement, unless this creates an accounting mismatch.
The new impairment model is an expected credit loss (ECL) model. The group is yet to assess IFRS 9’s
full impact.

IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, will replace IAS 18 which covers contracts for
goods and services and IAS 11 which covers construction contracts. The new standard is based on the
principle that revenue is recognised when control of a good or service transfers to a customer—so the
notion of control replaces the existing notion of risks and rewards. At this stage, the group is not able
to estimate the full impact of the new rules on the group’s financial statements. The group will make
more detailed assessments of the impact over the next twelve months.

**2.2   Basis of consolidation**
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group and its
subsidiaries as at 31 December 2015.

Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains
control, and continue to be consolidated until the date when such control ceases. The financial
statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company, using
consistent accounting policies. All intra-group balances, transactions, unrealised gains and losses
resulting from intra-group transactions and dividends are eliminated in full.

Total comprehensive income within a subsidiary is attributed to the non-controlling interest even if it
results in a deficit balance.

_Subsidiaries_
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Lock Lower Holding AS and
entities where the Group has controlling interest (subsidiaries). Controlling interest is achieved when
the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain
benefits from its activities. The Company obtains and exercises control through direct or indirect voting
rights. Controlling interest will normally exist when the Company has voting rights of more than 50%
through ownership or agreements.

The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent
company, using consistent accounting policies. These financial statements are for consolidation
purposes restated to IFRS. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are
included in the consolidated income statement from the date of control is obtained and until the control
ceases. Intercompany transactions, balances, revenues and expenses are eliminated in consolidation.
This also applies for unrealized internal gains and losses.

The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration
transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities
incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group. The
consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent
consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities
assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.


-----

Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the
fair value of non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If
this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference
is recognised in profit or loss.

There is a reassessment of the allocation of the acquisition price within 12 months after the acquisition
date when the initial accounting for a business combination can be determined only provisionally.

**2.3  Segment reporting**
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating
resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the CEO. The
operating businesses are organised and managed separately according to the nature of the products
and services provided, with each segment representing a strategic business unit that offers different
products and serves different markets.

The Group is organised in two main operating segments: Debt Purchasing and Debt Collection. The
Debt Purchasing segment consists of acquisition and management of mainly unsecured
non-performing loans and receivables. The Debt Collection segment consists of collection for various
clients and on portfolios of loans and receivables owned by Debt Purchasing.

The Other Group’s segment relates to revenues not related to the operating segments, as well as the
remaining head office expenses and amortisation of intangible assets.

The total revenue from external customers and intersegment sales are specified by country in note 5.

**2.4  Foreign currency translation**
The consolidated financial statements are presented in EUR, which is the Group’s presentation
currency.

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the
currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”).

The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from the
presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:

a) assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented (i.e. including
comparatives) are translated at the closing rate at the date of the financial position;

b) income and expenses for each income statement (i.e. including comparatives) are translated at
average exchange rates and

c) all exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income

Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency rate at the date of the
transaction or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting
from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at the year-end exchange rates of
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income
statement. Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents
are presented in income statement within “finance income or costs”. Foreign exchange gains and
losses on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities such as financial liabilities at fair value through
profit or loss are recognised in profit or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets
and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising are
recognised in other comprehensive income.


-----

**2.5  Tangible assets**
Tangible assets are recognised at cost, excluding the costs of day-to-day servicing, less accumulated
depreciation and accumulated impairment. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of such
tangible assets when that cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met. Depreciation is calculated
on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the assets. The useful lives of tangible assets, machinery
and fixtures are three to five years.

The carrying value of tangible assets is reviewed for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

An item of tangible assets is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are
expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as
the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in
the income statement in the year the asset is derecognised.

The asset’s residual values, useful lives and methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each
financial year-end.

**2.6  Intangible assets**
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible
assets acquired in a business combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial
recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any
accumulated impairment losses. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or
indefinite. The Group’s intangible assets are assessed to be finite except goodwill and brand.

Intangible assets with finite lives are mainly amortised on a straight-line basis over the useful economic
life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be
impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite
useful life are reviewed at least at each financial year-end. Changes in the expected useful life or the
expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset is accounted for by
changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and treated as changes in accounting
estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the income
statement as an expense and included in “Amortisation of intangible fixed assets”.

_a)   Goodwill_
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration
transferred over the Group’s interest in net fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities of the acquiree and the fair value of the non-controlling interest in the acquiree.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the
acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating
units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to
which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is
monitored for internal management purposes. The operating segment level is Debt Purchasing and
Debt Collection. However, when acquiring a company a PPA is prepared and the fair value of assets
and liabilities are allocated to the different assets. Loans and receivables are recognised at fair value
at the acquisition date. The goodwill is mainly allocated to the Debt Collection segment.

Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The carrying value of the goodwill is compared to the
recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal. Any
impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.

_b)   Brand_
Any debt collection contracts awarded for reasons other than price alone is considered to be a result of
brand name. Lindorff brand is well known and respected and ensures us to be invited to participate in
competitive tender offers we otherwise might not be eligible to.


-----

Brand arose on acquisition of subsidiary and got measured on initial recognition at cost. Of the three
main approaches to value the brand—Income, Market and Cost, Relief and Royalty income approach
was consider to be the most appropriate method for brand valuation.

Brand is assumed to have an indefinite useful life and impairment reviews are undertaken annually or
more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment.

_c)   Client relationships_
Client relationships include the rights related to collection contracts with a third party and got measured
on initial recognition at cost. Client relationships contracts are amortised straight line over their useful
economic lives.

_d)   Internally developed software_
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programs are recognised as an expense as
incurred. Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and
unique software products controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets when the
following criteria are met:

– it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use;

– management intends to complete the software product and use it;

– there is an ability to use or sell the software product;

– it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits;

– adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell
the software product are available; and the expenditure attributable to the software product during
its development can be reliably measured.

Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include employee costs
and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads.

Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as
incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a
subsequent period.

Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful
lives, which does not exceed five years unless strong indication of a longer useful life is demonstrated
(for instance by an underlying contract).

**2.7  Impairment of non-financial assets**
Intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life or intangible assets not ready to use are not subject
to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s
carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s
fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are
grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows (cash-generating
units).

Prior impairments of non-financial assets other than goodwill are reviewed for possible reversal at each
end of the reporting period. An assessment is made as to whether there is any indication that previously
recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the
recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has
been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last
impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its
recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been
determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
After such a reversal the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s revised
carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.


-----

**2.8  Financial assets**

_2.8.1 Classification_
Financial assets in the scope of IAS 39 are classified as either financial assets at fair value through
profit and loss or loans and receivables, as appropriate. The classification depends on the purpose for
which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial
assets at initial recognition.

a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset
is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives
are also categorised as held for trading. Assets in this category are classified as current assets if
expected to be settled within 12 months, otherwise they are classified as non-current. The Group’s
financial assets at fair value through profit and loss comprise only minor investments in shares.

b) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are
not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than
12 months after the end of the reporting period. These are classified as non-current assets. The Group’s
loans and receivables comprise mainly portfolios of purchased non-performing loans, “trade and other
receivables” and “cash and cash equivalents” (see note 14). Client funds are recognised on a separate
line in the Statement of financial position and therefore not included in the Group’s reported liquid
assets.

_2.8.2 Recognition and measurement_
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date which is the date on
which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value
plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss. Financial
assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction
costs are expensed in the income statement.

Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have
expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of
ownership.

Loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the “financial assets at fair value through
profit or loss” category are presented in the income statement within “Other (losses)/gains-net” in the
period in which they arise.

_Purchased loans and receivables_
Purchased loans and receivables are portfolios of non performing claims. A portfolio is defined to be the
lowest reliable level for pool of accounts with similar attributes. Typically, each portfolio consists of an
individual acquisition of accounts. Each portfolio is classified in the loans and receivable category and
is initially recorded at fair value including external cost of acquiring the portfolio. The portfolio is
accounted for as a single unit for the recognition of income, principal payments and adjustments from
recalculation of the estimated future cash flows.

The accounting policy is also applied when one or more portfolios are acquired in a business
combination.

Significant estimates are made by the management with respect to the collectability of future cash flows
from portfolios. The cash flow estimates are prepared by management on a rolling 15 year basis. If the
cash flow estimates are revised, the carrying amount is recalculated to reflect actual and
revised estimated cash flows by computing the present value of estimated future cash flows using the
initial effective interest rate. An adjustment in the carrying amount is recognised in net revenue.
See 2.20 Revenue recognition for further information.


-----

Management’s interpretations of historical cash flows, type of receivable, age, face value of the
individual account and experience from other portfolios form the basis for the cash flow estimates. As
these estimates are prepared on a rolling 15 year basis, an additional year is included in the 15 year
cash flow forecast each year. The effect of including an additional year is recorded as a revaluation in
the income statement. Actual results may differ from the estimates, making it reasonably possible that
a change in estimates could occur within one year and impact the carrying value of the related loans
and receivables. On a quarterly basis, management reviews the estimates of future cash flows, and
whether it is reasonably possible that its assessment of collectability may change based on actual
results and other factors that may have an impact on the estimates.

On a regular basis, Group acquires portfolios on a forward flow basis. This means that a contract is
established for purchases of debts at an agreed price, but where the volumes of debts are not fully
known at the time of agreement. The acquisition (delivery) of forward flow debts can be done on weekly,
monthly or quarterly basis. The effective interest rate is calculated by contract and used for each batch.
If experience indicates a change in the attributes of the claims management may decide to apply a new
effective interest rate for new batches.

_Other financial assets_
Long-term loans and receivables and other receivables are those that arise when the company provides
money without the intent to trade its claim. If the anticipated maturity is longer than one year they
constitute long-term receivables, and if it is shorter they are short-term receivables. Loans and
receivables are assessed at their discounted current value if their expected maturity exceeds 12
months. If their maturities are shorter, they are assessed at cost.

**2.9  Impairment of financial assets**
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a
financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets
is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a
result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a “loss event”) and
that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or a
group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.

Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing
significant financial difficulty, default of delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that
they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization, and where observable data indicate that
there is a measurable decreases in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or
economic conditions that correlate with defaults.

For loans and receivables category, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial
asset’s initial effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the
loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement. If a loan has a variable interest rate, the
discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under
the contract.

If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be
related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the reversal of the
previously recognised impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement.

**2.10 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities**
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge its risks
associated with interest rate. Such derivative financial instruments are initially and subsequently
measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities
when the fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives
during the year are taken directly to the income statement.


-----

**2.11 Trade and other receivables**
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers in the ordinary course of business. If collection is
expected in one year or less, they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as noncurrent assets. Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any credit losses recognised.

Legal fees/bailiff costs: The Group incurs outlays for bailiff/court costs, legal representation,
enforcement authorities, etc. which can be charged to and collected from debtors. In certain cases
Lindorff has agreements with its clients where expenses that cannot be collected from the debtor are
instead refunded by the client. The amount that is expected to be recovered from the client is
recognised as an asset in Other short term receivables.

Client funds: Client funds are reported as assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position and
comprise cash received on collection of a specific debt on behalf of a client and which are to be passed
on to the clients within a specified period.

**2.12 Cash and cash equivalents**
Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and in hand and short-term
deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.

**2.13 Equity**
Share capital is determined using the nominal value of shares that have been issued. Additional paidin capital includes any premiums received on the initial issuing of the share capital. Any transaction
costs associated with the issuing of shares are deducted from additional paid-in capital, net of any
related income tax benefits. Retained earnings include all current and prior period results as disclosed
in the income statement.

**2.14 Trade payables**
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary
course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is
due within one year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest method.

**2.15 Borrowings**
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less
directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

The upfront fees are a part of the borrowing cost and are recognised as an expense in accordance with
the effective interest method.

**2.16 Borrowing costs**
Borrowing costs other than upfront fees are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are
incurred.

**2.17 Current and deferred income tax**
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income
statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or
directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in
equity, respectively.


-----

_(a)_ _Current tax_
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively
enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the company and its subsidiaries operate and
generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect
to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions
where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected
to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.

_(b)_ _Deferred tax_
Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet
date between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting
purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:

– where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or
liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction,
affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and

– in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries,
associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary
differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in
the foreseeable future.

Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of
unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be
available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry-forward of unused tax
credits and unused tax losses can be utilized except:

– where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from
the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and,
at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and

– in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries,
associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent
that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable
profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.

The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced
to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part
of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are
reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable
that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to
the year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have
been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity
and the same taxation authority.

**2.18 Employee benefits**
**a)   Pension benefits**
The Group has various post-employment schemes, including both defined benefit and defined
contribution pension plans.


-----

**_Pension obligations_**
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a
separate entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contribution if the fund
does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the
current and prior periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan.

Typically defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit than an employee will receive on
retirement, usually depended on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.

The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present
value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit
credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the
estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are
denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity
approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation. In countries where there is no deep market
in such bonds, the market rates on governments bonds are used.

Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions
are charged or credited in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.

Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income.

For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered
pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further
payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as
employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the
extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.

**b)   Termination benefits**
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal
retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these
benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits at the earlier of the following dates: a) when the
Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and b) when the entity recognises costs for a
restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 and involves the payment or termination benefits. In the
case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination benefits are measured based
on the number of employees expected to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than 12 months
after the end of the reporting period are discounted to their present value.

**c)   Profit sharing and bonus plans**
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonus based on a formula that takes into
consideration the agreed terms.

**2.19 Provisions**
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result
of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required
to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where the
Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract,
the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually
certain. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the income statement net of any
reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a
current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting
is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a borrowing cost.

**2.20 Revenue recognition**
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received and represents interest and
amounts receivable for services supplied, stated net of discounts and value added taxes. The Group
recognizes revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured; when it is probable that


-----

future economic benefits will flow to the entity; and when specific criteria have been met for each of the
Group’s activities, as described below.

a) Commission and debt collection fees in Collection are recognised on collection of the debt

b) Income from subscription services is recognised proportionally over the duration of the
agreement, usually one year

c) Income from other services are recognised when the service is provided

d) Revenue on portfolios of purchased loans and receivables are recognised using the effective
interest method

Purchased loans and receivables consists mainly of portfolios of delinquent consumer debts purchased
at prices significantly below the nominal face value and are recognised according to IAS 39 for loans
and receivables, i.e. at amortised cost using the effective interest method. According to the effective
interest method, the carrying value of each portfolio corresponds to the present value of gross projected
future cash flows discounted by an initial effective interest rate determined on the date the portfolio was
acquired, and the method also allocates the interest revenue over the relevant period. The initial
effective interest rate is based on the relation between acquisition cost and the projected future cash
flows on the acquisition date.

With the projection of future gross cash flows and the purchase price including transaction costs as a
basis, each portfolio is assigned an initial effective interest rate that is then used to discount cash flows
through the life of the portfolio. If appropriate, the EIR is reassessed and adjusted up to 12 months after
the purchase of the portfolio of overdue receivables to reflect refinements made to our estimates of
future cash flows based on enhanced data and analysis considered during that time period. This
adjustment has historically not resulted in any material impact on our income from purchased portfolios.

Current cash flow projections are monitored over the course of the year and updated based on, among
other things, achieved collection results, agreements reached with debtors on instalment plans and
macroeconomic information. Cash flow projections are made at portfolio level, since each portfolio of
receivables consists of homogeneous accounts. On the basis of the updated cash flow projections and
the initial effective interest rate, a new carrying value for the portfolio is calculated at the end of the
reporting period.

Changes over time in the book value can be divided into a time and interest rate component and a
component related to changes in estimates of future cash flows. Changes in cash flow forecasts are
treated symmetrically, i.e., both increases and decreases in forecast flows affect the portfolios’ book
value and, as a result net revenue.

Income on portfolios is accrued monthly based on each portfolios effective interest rate. Monthly cash
flows greater than the cash flow forecast for the same period is recorded as revenue in the period.
Likewise, monthly cash flows that are less than the monthly cash flow forecast for the same period is
recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period. Compensation received due to price adjustments for
portfolios acquired are recorded as an adjustment to the book value.

**2.21 Leases**
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor
are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income
statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

Leases where the Group assumes substantially all risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the
leased assets are classified as finance leases. The leased assets and the corresponding lease liabilities
(net of finance charges) under finance leases are recognised on the balance sheet as plant and
equipment and borrowings respectively, at the inception of the leases based on the lower of the fair
value of the leased assets and the present value of the minimum lease payments.

Each lease payment is apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding
lease liability. The finance expense is recognised in profit or loss on a basis that reflects a constant
periodic rate of interest on the finance lease liability.


-----

**2.22 Dividend distribution**
Dividends proposed by the Board of Directors are not recorded in the financial statements until they
have been approved by the shareholders at the Shareholder’s General Meeting.

**2.23 Related parties**
Parties are related if one party has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise
significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Parties are also
related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence. All transactions between
the related parties are based on the principle of ‘arm’s length’ (estimated market value).

**2.24 Classification in the statement of financial position**
Current assets and short-term liabilities include items due less than one year from the balance sheet
date, and items tied to the operating cycle, if longer. The current portion of long-term debt is included
as current liabilities. Other assets are classified as non-current assets.

**2.25 Cash flow statement**
The indirect method is used for the cash flow statement. For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow
statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined in 2.12.

Cash related to acquisition of portfolios of loans and receivables is included in investing activities while
payments and amortisation on these portfolios are included in operating activities.

**3** **Critical accounting estimates**
Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances.

The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting
estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.

**Estimates and assumptions**

_Revenue recognition Purchased loans and receivables_
The Group uses the effective interest rate method to account for portfolios and loans. The use of the
effective interest rate method requires the Group to estimate future cash flows from loans and
receivables at each balance sheet date. The underlying estimates that form the basis for revenue
recognition depends on variables such as the ability to contact the debtor and reach an agreement,
timing of cash flows, general economic environment and statutory regulations. If the estimations are
revised, the Group adjusts the carrying amount of the portfolios and loans to reflect actual and revised
estimated cash flows in accordance with IAS 39 paragraph AG8. Events or changes in assumptions and
managements judgment will affect the recognition of revenue in the period.

_Book value of Purchased loans and receivables_
Loans and receivables (portfolios) consist mainly of acquired non-performing unsecured loans and
non-derivative financial assets without fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market. Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Events or
changes in assumptions and managements judgment will affect the cash flow for the portfolios and
therefore also the net present value of future cash flows and the book value of the portfolios. See
note 14.

_Impairment of goodwill_
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired when circumstances indicate that there may be a
potential impairment. Estimating recoverable amounts of assets and companies are partly based on
management’s evaluation, including estimates of future performance, revenue generating capacity of


-----

the assets, and assumptions of the future market conditions. Changes in circumstances and in
management’s estimation of future events may give rise to impairment losses.

Impairment of goodwill is evaluated on an annual basis and determined by assessing the recoverable
amount of the cash-generating unit (group of cash-generating units), to which the goodwill relates.
Estimating the recoverable amount requires the Group to make assumptions regarding the expected
future cash flow and the discount rate used to calculate the net present value of those cash flows. See
note 12.

_Deferred Income Tax Assets_
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable
profit will be available against which the losses can be utilized. Significant management judgment is
required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely
timing and level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.

The Group is subject to income taxes in some jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in
determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. There are transactions and calculations for which
the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit
issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these
matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current
and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.

**4    Financial risk management**
**4.1  Financial risk factors**
Lindorff Group is exposed to financing risk, market risk, currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and
liquidity risk. The risk management guidelines set out in the Group Treasury Policy aim to reduce the
effect of volatility in financial markets and the potential adverse effects that can have on the Group’s
financial performance.

_a)_ _Market risk_
The services and products offered in the respective local geographical markets are subject to strict local
laws and regulations including requirements for debt collection licenses.

i) Market and regulatory environment
The main market risk is related to general macroeconomic conditions and local rules and statutory
regulations in each of the geographical markets the Group is present in and which affect the debtors’
ability to pay and the vendors’ ability and willingness to sell portfolios of loans and receivables and
potential commission from third party collection.

ii) Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various
currency exposures, primarily with respect to NOK (Norwegian krone), SEK (Swedish krone) and PLN
(Polish zloty) compared to the Group’s internal and external reporting currency EUR. Foreign exchange
risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments
in foreign operations.

The Group’s strategy is to manage and limit currency risk. The following exchange rates have been
used to translate SEK, NOK and PLN in the financial accounts:

**NOK                                                                            2015            2014**
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– –––––––      –––––––
Average............................................................................................................     8.94         8.35

**SEK                                                                            2015            2014**

Average............................................................................................................     4.18
Closing .............................................................................................................     4.25


-----

Foreign exchange exposures can be classified into the following groups:

**Transaction exposure**
Transaction exposures are concentrated to as few Group’s entities as possible in order to create
“natural hedges” where positive exposures are off-set by negative, i.e. incoming foreign currency cash
flows are off-set by outgoing cash flows.

In the operating entities, revenues and operating expenses are mainly denominated in local currencies,
and thus currency fluctuations have only a limited impact on operating earnings. National operations
seldom have receivables and liabilities in foreign currency.

Transaction exposure is hedged when there is a high degree of certainty in terms of the size and timing
of the currency flow.

**Translation exposure**
The Group operates in 13 countries. The results and financial position of subsidiaries are reported in
the relevant foreign currencies and later translated into EUR for inclusion in the consolidated financial
statements. Approximately 42% (2014: 43%) of the Group’s revenue is in foreign currency.
Consequently, fluctuations in exchange rates against EUR affect the Group’s revenues and earnings,
as well as equity and other items in the financial statements.

**Economic value exposure**
The relative economic value based on Net sales, Cost of Sales, Operating expenses, EBIT, is exposed
to foreign exchange fluctuations.

The largest relative economic value deriving from non-EUR currencies, are protected by means of
external financing denominated in the corresponding currencies at the same relative currency mix.
Interest payments and debt repayments on bank debt and bonds serve as a natural hedge of future
operating cash flows in the relevant currencies.

The Group’s revenues are distributed by currency as follows:

**1 Jan-31 Dec     22 May-31 Dec**
**EURm                                                                         2015            2014**
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  –––––––––   ––––––––––
EUR............................................................................................................        308           74
DKK............................................................................................................         23            6
NOK............................................................................................................        138           36
SEK ............................................................................................................         57           13
Other currencies.........................................................................................          7            1
–––––––––   ––––––––––
**Total** ...........................................................................................................        534          130
–––––––––   ––––––––––                                                            –––––––––   ––––––––––

If currencies had weakened/strengthened by 10% in average against the presentation currency EUR
with all other variable held constant, net revenues would have decreased/increased by approximately
EUR 21m (2014: 6m).

**b)** **Interest rate risk**
Interest rate risk relate primarily to the Group’s interest-bearing net debt. As at 31 December 2015 the
external interest bearing debt amounted to EUR 2,116m, consisting of drawings on the Super Senior
Revolving Credit Facility (SS RCF), senior secured fixed rate notes, senior secured floating rate notes,
senior fixed rate notes and senior floating rate notes.

Hedging is arranged partly by raising fixed rate debt and by fixing interest rates with interest rate swaps.
As of 31 December 2015 the share of fixed rate bonds was 51%, and the share of fixed rate bonds
including swaps was 58%.

The floating rate bonds are tied to the market rate with quarterly interest fixing. A one-percent increase
in market interest rates would have adversely affected net financial items by approximately EUR 8m.
A five-percent increase would have adversely affected net financial items by approximately EUR 40m.


-----

**c)** **Credit risk**
Credit risk is the risk that Lindorff’s counterparties are unable to fulfil their obligations to the Group. Each
local entity is responsible for managing and analysing the credit risk for each of their new clients before
standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. Credit risk arises from assets such as
cash and cash equivalents, guarantees and derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks
and financial institutions, as well as outstanding receivables; Purchased loans and receivables and
outlays on behalf of clients. For financial assets owned by Lindorff, no collateral (very limited) or other
credit reinforcements have been received.

The maximum credit exposure for each class of financial assets therefore corresponds to the carrying
amount.

There is also a limited risk of loss linked to the Group’s Third Party Debt Collection, however the risk is
primarily carried by the client.

_Portfolios of purchased loans and receivables_
To minimize the risks related to purchase of non-performing claims, caution is exercised in purchase
decisions. Purchases are usually made from clients with whom the Group has maintained long-term
relationships and therefore has a thorough understanding of the receivables in question. Purchased
loans and receivables are usually purchased at prices significantly below the nominal value of the
receivables, and are not collateralised. Lindorff retains the entire amount collected, including interest
and fees.

Lindorff has high yield requirements on purchased loans and receivables. Before every acquisition, a
careful assessment is made based on a projection of future cash flows (estimated gross collection less
expected costs of collection) from the portfolio. In its calculations, Lindorff is aided by its long
experience in collection management and its valuation models.

Scoring entails the consumer’s payment capacity being assessed with the aid of statistical analysis.
Lindorff therefore believes that it has the expertise required to evaluate these types of receivables.

To facilitate the purchase of larger portfolios at attractive risk levels, Lindorff works in cooperation with
other companies, primarily in Spain and Lithuania. Risks are further diversified by acquiring receivables
from clients in different sectors and different countries.

A share of the investments in purchased loans and receivables has been made as forward flow
agreements (see note 29), meaning that the Group has committed to buy non-performing debt portfolios
for delivery in future periods. The duration of the contracts are usually not more than 12 months and for
the majority of contracts Lindorff has the possibility to decline to acquire the portfolios if the credit quality
of the claims are significant weaker than assumed in the agreement.

The Group’s purchased loans and receivables include debtors in 13 countries and the carrying value is
distributed as follows:

**Purchased loans and receivables Carrying value per country**

- Eastern and Central Europe include Finland, Russia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania

Purchased loans and receivables are overdue at acquisition date and therefore usually purchased at
prices significantly below the nominal value. The average claim size at the end of 2015 was
approximately EUR 3,086 (2014: 3,085). Even though it is obvious that the full face value will not be
recovered, the Group has the right to collect the full face value including principal, interest and fees on
its own behalf.

The carrying value of EUR 1,070m as at 31 December 2015, representing approximately 5.7% of face
value, is the maximum theoretical risk if the whole portfolio become worthless/non collectable.

The Group has established long term relationship with large financial institutions in Europe. As a result
the distribution of carrying value of the portfolios of purchased loans and receivables by sector shows
that 88% are claims acquired from Banks and other financial institutions at the end of 2015 (2014: 89%).

The Group has had only minor impairment losses and positive revaluations during the last year.

See note 14 regarding fair value of the portfolios of acquired loans and receivables.

In order to continue minimising the credit risk exposure, Lindorff continues to invest in staff with a broad
experience in credit management, and focus on increased analytical approach to portfolio
assessments. Monitoring processes are implemented to follow up actual collection compared to
forecasts. In addition, the Group’s investment in effective IT systems and a more uniform cross-border
business model will result in better control of the Group’s business, which in turn will also help reduce
the risk of credit loss.

**d)** **Liquidity risk**
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group does not have the ability to fulfil its short and long-term payment
obligations to outside parties. The Group’s long-term financing risk is minimized through long term
financing in the form of committed lines of credit. As of 31 December the Group held unused facilities
totalling EUR 92.5m (net of EUR 25m allocated to guarantees).

To guarantee short-term solvency, Lindorff Group should have liquid assets at disposal, a Liquidity
Reserve, covering minimum 1.5 months of disbursements. The liquidity reserve is defined as bank
balances or invested funds that can be released within two banking days without any additional or minor
cost, plus any unutilized credit facilities, committed for minimum 12 months, less any outstanding
uncommitted debt.

Cash forecasting is performed by the operating entities of the Group and aggregated by Group
Treasury. Group Treasury monitors rolling forecasts to ensure that the Group has sufficient cash to meet
operational and financial expenditures, while also monitoring that borrowing limits and covenants in the
Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and Bond documentation are adhered to.

In order to increase flexibility and improve the cash efficiency, an overlay cash pooling structure is put
in place within the Group. The cash pool structure secures that the operating entities have sufficient
liquidity to cover working capital needs, while also securing that excess liquidity is transferred to the
Group. Excess liquidity is used to repay drawings under the revolving credit facilities, and/or if
applicable invested at low risk in accordance with investment rules set forth in the Group Treasury
Policy.

The table below shows the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities and net settled derivative financial
liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining periods at the balance sheet date to
the contractual maturity date. Derivative financial liabilities are included in the analysis if their
contractual maturities are essential for an understanding of the timing of the cash flows. The amounts
disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.

**4.2** **Capital management**
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a
going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. In order
to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to
shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.

The credit ratio is calculated as Net Interest Bearing Debt divided by LTM Adjusted EBITDA adjusted
for Non-Recurring Items and pro forma effect (if applicable) of carve-outs and M&A’s. Net Interest
Bearing Debt is calculated as outstanding bond debt and drawings on the SS Revolving Credit Facility
less cash and cash equivalents. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA adjusted for amortisation
and revaluation of portfolios of purchased loans and receivables.

The credit ratio as at 31 December 2015 was 5.7x.

The Group has been assigned a credit rating of B+ by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services and B2 by
Moody’s Investor Services.

**5** **Segment information**
Management has determined the operating segments based on information reviewed by management
for the purpose of allocating resources and assessing performance. Management considers the
performance from a product perspective and separately considers the Debt Purchasing and Debt
Collection.

Both segments meet the quantitative thresholds required by IFRS 8 for reportable segments.
Management assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of Contribution
Margin 1 which is gross revenues minus direct operating expenses.

**Revenue**
Sales between segments are carried out at arm’s length. The revenue from external parties reported to
management is measured in a manner consistent with that in the income statement. The following table
presents a reconciliation of the reportable segments’ main captions from profit and loss to the entity’s
profit and loss before tax:

**Expectations regarding effective tax rate**
The Group is subject to varying income tax rates depending on local tax regulations in the relevant
country; hence Lindorff’s operations are subject to effective tax rates ranging from 15% to significantly
above the nominal tax rates. Several countries have implemented interest limitations rules which may
increase the effective tax rate going forward. This may be offset somewhat with lower nominal tax rates.
In some periods, tax losses (and interest) carried forward that are not recognised in the statement of
financial position will cause variations in the effective tax rate. In periods, when such assets are not
recognised, the effective tax rate will be higher than the long-term expectation, whereas it may be lower
in period when tax losses not recognised as assets have been utilised.

_b)    Deferred tax_
The deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the period are as follows:

Deferred income tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that the realisation
of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are offset within the same tax jurisdiction.

The Group has substantial tax losses brought forward in the end of 2015. These have to a large extent
been generated by interest on shareholder loans in to the Lindorff Group prior to the acquisition in
October 2014.

Lindorff Group has certain tax issues related to deductibility of interest of group internal loans in Finland
and Norway. Tax exposure of these cases is estimated at EUR 42m including EUR 6m of potential
penalties, whereof EUR 27m has been paid on request to respective tax authorities in Norway and
Finland in 2015 and additional EUR 5m as advance current tax in Finland.

Lindorff contests the claims and has filed complaints to the Tax Authorities in both countries. No
provisions have been recorded as Lindorff believes that our arguments are strong and hence our
standing in the disputes is solid.

**10   Fixtures and furniture**
Carrying value of fixtures and furniture were EUR 14m as at 31 December 2015 (2014: 12m).
Investment in fixtures and fittings were EUR 5m and additional EUR 2m were taken over through
acquisition of Casus Finanse (2014: 13m); the depreciation was EUR 3m (2014: 1 m).

The assets are depreciated over the economic useful lives which are usually considered to be
3-5 years.

**11   Intangible assets**
Intangible assets in the table below consist of internally developed software, client relationships and

Brand, client relations and goodwill (see note 12) are acquired in connection with business acquisitions.
Client relations include the rights related to collection contracts with a third party, and are amortised
straight line over their useful economic lives. Investment in client relationships in the reporting period
amounted to EUR 23m (2014: 165 m).

Brand value related to acquisition of Lindorff Group in 2014 amounting to EUR 83m is recognised as
an intangible asset. Brand is considered having an indefinite useful life time and is not amortised. The
value is tested for impairment on a yearly basis together with goodwill.

Amortisation of intangible assets having a definite useful life time is included in “depreciation and
amortisation” costs for the year in income statement.

Lindorff has two major business areas: (i) Debt Collection, consisting of debt-related administrative
services and (ii) Debt Purchasing. Book value of goodwill as at 31 December 2015 as at EUR 1,384m
is allocated to Debt Collection segment.

Goodwill related to Lindorff acquisition in October 2014 was identified at EUR 1,416m.

Acquisition price of Casus Finanse in Poland August 2015 was EUR 35m. Like Lindorff, Casus group
has two major business areas: i) Debt Collection, consisting of debt-related administrative services and
(ii) Debt Purchasing.

The purchase price allocation procedure reconciles the transaction values with projected future cash
flow from the segments. The identified intangible assets in Poland are related to Debt Collection
segment, in all material aspects.

_Valuation of Debt Collection_
Forecasted revenues comprise estimated revenues from 3PC (3rd party collection) and IDC (internal
debt collection) based on historical growth with declined growth towards the end of period. Forecasted
operating expenses relate to staff cost in debt collection operations. Based on estimated depreciation
and amortisation, tax rate of 25%, WACC of 6.5% and terminal growth of 3%, the business enterprise
value of Debt Collection segment is estimated at EUR 1,953m.

_Brand name_
Lindorff brand is well known and respected and ensures us to be invited to participate in competitive
tender offers we otherwise might not be eligible to. Value of brand name is estimated by a royalty based
model, assuming a royalty rate of 1.5% net of maintenance and administration cost. Based on a
discount rate of 7% the brand name value is estimated at EUR 83m with an indefinite useful lifetime.
Value is tested annually for impairment together with goodwill.

_Database_
Statistic databases allow Lindorff to do qualified debt purchasing decisions as well as improve
profitability in Debt Collection. The value of database related to Debt Purchase is included in the fair
value of portfolios. Value of database related to Debt Collection is highly connected to the competence
of our employees and is hard to separate from the value of workforce. The value of database is
estimated to be non-material and is not recognised as a separate intangible asset.

_Workforce_
Under current IFRS3, workforce cannot be recognised as an asset separable from goodwill. As
Lindorff’s business model depends on attract, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled employees,


-----

the workforce is considered of material value. Based on assumptions of recruiting cost, training cost,
efficiency cost of hiring new people compared to experienced staff members, Lindorff estimates the
value of the workforce in each business combination transaction and reported and tested annually
tested for impairment as part of goodwill.

_Goodwill allocated at acquisition of Casus Group_
Based on the purchase price and fair value valuation of identified assets and liabilities, the preliminary
goodwill is estimated at EUR 29m. Prediction of future cash flows in new entities is connected with
significant uncertainty, especially when entering new markets. The valuation based on PPA (Purchase
price allocation) is to be considered as a preliminary assessment and may be reallocated within 12
months after acquisition.

_Impairment testing of goodwill_
Goodwill is tested for impairment on yearly basis by comparing recoverable amount with carrying value.
Recoverable amount has been determined by value in use based on management estimates of future
cash flow for the period 2016 – 2019 approved by the Board, average growth of 7% in the measurement
period, terminal growth rate of 3%, tax rate of 25% and WACC of 6.5%. The value of Debt Collection
segment is EUR 1.953m. Carrying value of Debt Collection segment is net operational segment assets,
recognised at EUR 1.677m. No impairment is identified.

Determination of WACC for goodwill impairment testing:

_Risk free rate_
Goodwill is denominated mainly in EUR, but also partly in NOK and a minor part in PLN. The risk free
rate used in the calculation of the WACC is based on the Norwegian 10 year government bond interest
rate, which on 31st December was priced at 1.37%. The respective 10 year government bond for the
other currencies range from 0.63% for EUR and 3.1% for PLN. Given the fluctuations in the yield for
these bonds we deem it reasonable to use the NOK risk free rate as basis for the risk free rate for the
Group. Calculating a currency specific WACC for each currency, the risk free rate element would have
decreased the WACC slightly compared to the WACC used.

_Risk premium_
Based on available market information related to CMS business, the long-term risk premium is about
6.4%,

_Equity Beta_
The equity beta is based on 5 years of weekly observations for market peers. The calculations are
based on data from Bloomberg. We have then used this as a basis for our Beta re-levered.

_Trade receivables_
The Group’s trade receivables are related to clients in various industries and regions. The Group’s
largest client accounts for less than 8% of revenues in 2015. Most accounts receivable outstanding are
with customers known to the Group and whose creditworthiness is good and Lindorff has historically
had very limited losses on such receivables.

_Other short-term receivables_
Other short-term receivables consist mainly of accrued income not invoiced, payment service
receivables and fee outlay, where customer is bearing the risk. It also includes short-term restricted
deposit and other receivables, where credit risk is considered to be low.

**14   Purchased loans and receivables**
Purchased loans and receivables are classified as loans and receivables and recognised at amortised
cost according to the effective interest method.

The Group determines the carrying value by calculating the present value of estimated future cash flows
at the receivables’ initial effective interest rate. Adjustments are recognised in the income statement. In
the company’s opinion, the market’s yield requirements in the form of effective interest rates on new
portfolios have remained fairly constant despite turbulence in global financial markets in recent years.
The valuation method used results in the best estimate of the fair value of debt portfolios.

The carrying value of purchased loans and receivables:

The carrying value of Purchased loans and receivables recognised at amortised cost does not perfectly
match the fair value determined by discounting the net cash flow i.e. the gross cash receipts reduced
by the cost to collect discounted with a market based discount rate at every end of the reporting period.
The method and result of the fair value estimation as at 31 December is illustrated below and shows a
non-significant deviation between the two valuation methods. The method falls within level 3 of the fair
value hierarchy.


-----

**Fair value estimation of portfolios of purchased debt and receivables**
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (e.g. loans and
receivables) is determined by using valuation techniques such as net present value of estimated cash
flows. For loans and receivables, the discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital, which
is weighted value of the Group’s cost of debt and the cost of equity. The cost of equity is estimated by
applying the capital asset pricing model.

The preparation of cash flow estimates requires significant estimates to be made by management
regarding future cash flows from portfolios. The estimated future portfolio cash flows are reviewed by
management each quarter. The fair value is estimated to be approximately EUR 1,126m (2014: 843m)
and is based on net future estimated cash flows after tax, discounted with the estimated WACC. The
corresponding carrying amount is EUR 1,070 (2014: 809m), which is based on IAS 39 using the
estimated gross future cash flows, where the discount factor is the individual IRR for the each portfolio.
The future cash flow forecasts used to estimate the fair market value are the same as the cash flow
forecast used in the accounting for loans and receivables at 31 December 2015.

The fair value estimation is based on estimated annual net cash flows from portfolios. The estimated
annual net cash flows from portfolios is the assumed annual future collection on portfolios per country,
less assumed annual collection costs per portfolio before tax. Collection costs consist of operational
costs in the portfolio segment, i.e. commission to Debt Collection, payroll expenses, premises,
communication costs, depreciation and other costs directly attributable to the Debt Purchasing
segment. The collection costs as a percentage of the portfolio collection differ from portfolio to portfolio,
ranging from 5.0% to over 50.0%.

In addition, the country specific marginal tax rate is applied. This individual collection cost and tax rate
is applied to each portfolio’s estimated future cash flow, adding up to an estimated total net cash flow
for the Group.

The weighted average cost of capital after tax for the portfolio segment is estimated to 12% (2014: 12%)
as at 31 December 2015 (details of the calculation is shown below). Based on this rate, the discounted
value of the estimated net cash flows indicates that the fair value of portfolios is approximately EUR
1,126m (2014: 843m).

To evaluate this calculation, a sensitivity analysis of the cash flow estimates is presented in the table
below in order to see the effect of deviations to the cash flow estimates and variations in the cost of
capital.

The cost of capital after tax for the Portfolio segment is calculated using the capital asset pricing model
(CAPM) in combination with the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Based on the variables from
the table below, the estimated cost of capital after tax is approximately 12%.

_Risk free rate_
The risk free rate used in the calculation of the WACC is based on the EUR risk free interest rate, which
on 31st December was priced at 0.63%. However, the Group has a significant part of the cash flows in
other different currencies, the largest being NOK and SEK. The respective 10 year government bond
for these currencies range from 0.63% for EUR, 1.48% for NOK and 0.96% for SEK. Given the


-----

fluctuations in the yield for these bonds we deem it reasonable to use the EUR risk free rate as basis
for the risk free rate for the Group. Calculating a currency specific WACC for each currency, the risk
free rate element would have increased the WACC slightly compared to the WACC estimated for the
Group.

_Risk premium_
Based on empirical research done the long-term risk premium is about 6.7%. It is reasonable to assume
that the risk of investing in non-performing loan portfolios is higher than observed average market risk
premium. Therefore a small cap premium risk premium of 9.74% is added to the calculation—resulting
in a total risk premium of 16.44%. These risk premiums are based on the research found by Ilbbotson
Risk Premiums Over time Report.

_Equity Beta_
The equity beta is based on 5 years of weekly observations for market peers. The calculations are
based on data from Bloomberg. We have then used this as a basis for our Beta re-levered.

_Future cash flow estimates_
The future cash flow estimates are based on the current 15 year IFRS forecast for the current asset
base with no value after this 15 year period. Therefore there are no adding cash flows from future
investments included in the fair value estimation.

**Bonds and liabilities to credit institutions**
The Group is funded through a Super Senior RCF (SSRCF) of EUR 324m, Senior Secured Notes of
EUR 1,457m equivalent (issued in EUR and NOK) and Senior Notes of EUR 451m equivalent (issued
in EUR and SEK).

The average interest on the notes is approximately 7% with an average duration of 5.6 years. The
SSRCF is priced at a current margin of 3.50%. At year-end 2015 the RCF draw amounted to EUR 207m
(excluding a draw for unfunded guarantees of EUR 20m).

The covenants set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Agreement and the Senior Notes Agreement are
typical for 144A/Reg S high yield issue of this type, including but not limited to the following: Change of
Control, Debt Incurrence, Permitted Liens, Limitation on Sales of Assets & Subsidiary Stock, Limitation
on Affiliate Transactions, Limitation on Restricted Payments, Anti-layering, Reports, Merger and
Consolidation, Line of Business and Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade
Status.

The SSRCF Agreement contains certain of the incurrence covenants that are set forth in the Senior
Secured Notes Agreement. In addition, the SSRCF Agreement contains a Drawn Super Senior
Leverage Ratio financial covenant which will be tested for each annual accounting period and quarterly
on a rolling twelve month basis; The Financial Covenant is set at 2:1 (Drawn Super Senior
Indebtedness to Adjusted EBITDA).


-----

**Security package**
Companies of the Group representing more than 80% of consolidated EBITDA and more than 90% of
consolidated assets for the year ended December 31, 2015 have provided security for the SSRCF and
the Bond package through pledges of shares, bank accounts, receivables and a guarantee for the
commitments under the SSRCF and the Bond Package. Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the
liens securing the Senior Secured Notes will be senior liens over the Senior Secured Notes Collateral
that rank equally with the liens that secure: (i) on a super-priority basis (A) obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and (B) obligations under certain super-priority hedging
arrangements; and (ii) on an equal and ratable basis, (A) certain other future debt permitted to be
incurred under the Senior Secured Indenture, including certain acquisition indebtedness and
(B) obligations under certain hedging arrangements. The Senior Notes will be secured by the Shared
Collateral on a second-ranking basis and by the Senior Notes Only Collateral on a first-ranking basis.

EURIBOR 3 months and STIBOR 3 months.

**26** **Post-employment benefits**
The Group has pension liabilities for certain employees from defined benefit plans in Norway. The major
plans are covered by assets in funds administrated by insurance companies. The plans are final salary
pension plans, which provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable
for a specific number of years. The level of benefits provided depends on members’ length of service
and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement. The plans in Lindorff have been closed to
new employees since 2006. Pensions for new employees are instead based on defined contribution
plans.

The plan assets consist primarily of investments in listed bonds. Due to the low net exposure there
would not be a significant impact on the financial position of the company due to reasonable changes
in the actuarial assumptions.

The main actuarial assumptions are as follows:

**31 Dec 2015** **31 Dec 2014**
–––––––––––– ––––––––––––

**Pension insurance with Alecta, Sweden**
Retirement pension and family pension obligations for salaried employees in Sweden are secured
through pension insurance with Alecta. This constitutes a multi-employer plan. For the 2015 fiscal year,
the company did not have access to such information that would enable the company to record this plan
as a defined benefit plan. Consequently, the ITP pension plan secured through insurance with Alecta is
recorded as a defined contribution plan. The contribution to the plan is determined based on the age,
salary and previously earned pension benefits of the plan participants. The expected contributions for


-----

pension insurance taken out with Alecta for the next annual reporting period are expected to be in line
with current year which was EUR 0.4m. The Group’s level of participation in the plan is insignificant.

The collective consolidation ratio reflects the market value of Alecta’s assets as a percentage of
insurance obligations, calculated in accordance with Alecta’s actuarial assumptions, which do not
correspond with IAS 19. The collective solvency is normally allowed to vary between 125 and
155 percent. If the level of collective solvency is less than 125 percent or exceeds 155 percent,
measures are to be taken in order to create conditions for restoring the level of collective solvency to
the normal interval. Alecta’s surplus can be distributed to the policyholders and/or the insured if the
collective consolidation ratio exceeds 155 percent. However, Alecta aim to avoid surplus by using
reduced contributions. At December 31, 2015, Alecta’s surplus corresponded to a collective
consolidation ratio of 153 percent.

**Germany**
In addition there is a defined benefit plan for one employee in Germany. The net value of the plan is
negative and EUR 35k (2014: 25k) is recognised as a defined benefit liability.

**27** **Provisions for other liabilities and charges**
The Group had provisions for other liabilities of EUR 1m (2014: 2m).

**28** **Pledged assets, contingent assets and liabilities**
The external funding of the Group is secured through Lock AS and Lock Lower Holding AS.

Companies of the Group representing more than 80% of EBITDA as of 31 December 2015 have
provided security for the RCF and the Bond package through pledge of shares, bank accounts,
receivables and a guarantee for the commitments under the RCF and the Bond package.

When conducting their business, the Group companies are from time to time obliged to provide bank
guarantees to various government bodies or business parties. Such guarantees are backed by a
guarantee facility, which is part of the Group’s funding through Lock AS. The guarantee facility amounts
to EUR 25m, where upon EUR 21m is currently utilised.

The book value of the share pledge amounts to:

Lindorff Group has certain tax issues related to deductibility of interest of group internal loans in Finland
and Norway. Tax exposure of these cases is estimated at EUR 42m including EUR 6m of potential
penalties, whereof EUR 27m has been paid on request to respective tax authorities in Norway and
Finland in 2015 and additional EUR 5m as advance current tax in Finland. Lindorff contests the claims
and has filed complaints to the Tax Authorities in both countries. No provisions have been recorded as
Lindorff believes that our arguments are strong and hence our standing in the disputes is solid.

During the normal business operations, the Group faces from time to time claims in civil lawsuits and
disputes, most of which involve relatively limited amounts. None of these disputes is considered likely
to have any significant effect on the Group or its financial position.

**29** **Commitments**
_(a)   Capital commitments_
Capital expenditure contracted for at the end of the reporting period but not yet incurred is as follows:

**Total.................................................................................................................         88        96**
–––––––––––– –––––––––––––––––––––––– ––––––––––––

The Group has committed to buy non-performing Debt Portfolios for delivery in future periods; these
commitments are from “forward flow” contracts and—for Poland—an investment fund in which we have
obligated ourselves to become owner of total fund over time. Estimated Capital Expenditure is based
on previous acquisitions under the same contracts and client’s expectations.

_(b)   Operating lease commitments—Group company as lessee_
The Group leases various offices under non-cancellable operating lease agreements. The lease terms
are between 5 and 10 years, and the majority of lease agreements are renewable at the end of the
lease period at market rate.

The Group also leases various cars and machinery under cancellable operating lease agreements. The
Group is required to give a six-month notice for the termination of these agreements. The lease
expenditure charged to the income statement during the year is disclosed under other operating costs.

The future aggregated minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows:

**30** **Business combinations**
**Acquisition of Casus Finanse S.A. in Poland**
On 18 August 2015, Lindorff acquired Casus Finanse (changed name to Lindorff S.A group in March
2016), one of the largest Credit Management Services (CMS) players in Poland. With this acquisition
Lindorff expands its geographical footprint in Europe.

The purchase price for Casus Finanse was EUR 35m.

The allocation of the purchase price to assets and liabilities at fair value led to recognition of goodwill
at EUR 29m.

Casus Finanse was established in 1997 and has a long term experience in serving the Polish CMS
market. Like Lindorff, Casus group has two major business areas: Debt Collection, consisting of debtrelated administrative services and Debt Purchasing.

Lindorff expects synergies effects of Casus knowledge of the market combined with Lindorff’s business
model for collection performances. The workforce of approximately 500 FTEs is considered of material
value. Based on assumptions of recruiting cost, training cost, efficiency cost of hiring new people
compared to experienced staff members, Lindorff estimates the value of the workforce to be significant.


-----

Valuation of purchased loans and receivables based on information available at purchase date, was
EUR 23m. Prediction of future cash flows in new entities is connected with significant uncertainty,
especially when entering new markets. The valuation based on the PPA (Purchase price allocation) is to
be considered as a preliminary assessment and may be reallocated within 12 months after acquisition.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements**

**1** **General information**
The parent company Lindorff International AB is a registered company domiciled in Stockholm with
office address at Kungsgatan 57A, P.O. Box 47292, SE-100 74 Stockholm, Sweden.

Lindorff group have two core business segments; Debt Purchasing and Debt Collection. The Debt
Purchasing segment consists of the acquisition, management and collection of unsecured
non-performing loans. The Third Party Debt Collection segment consists of contingency collection for
various clients. Other services include invoice and loan administration.

The group has offices in 12 countries—Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway,
Spain, Sweden, Russia and the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania).

The consolidated financial statements of the group for the period ended 31 December 2014 were
authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Board of Directors on 25 June 2015.

**2** **Summary of significant accounting policies**
**2.1** **Basis of preparation**
The consolidated financial statements of Lindorff International AB and all its subsidiaries have been
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as approved by the EU
and interpretations set by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying
the group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas
where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed
in note 3.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for financial
derivatives that have been measured at fair value through profit or loss.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in EUR and all values are rounded to the nearest
million (EURm) except when otherwise indicated. The consolidated accounts pertain to 1 January to
31 December for income statements and 31 December for items on the statements of financial position.

_2.1.1 Changes in accounting policy and disclosures_
The group has adopted all new and revised standards and interpretations issued by IASB and IFRIC
and approved by EU if relevant to the business and come into force for the accounting year starting
1 January 2014.

The following standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual
periods beginning after 1 January 2015, but have been applied in preparing this consolidated financial
statement:

IFRS 9, “Financial instruments”, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial
assets and financial liabilities. The complete version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014. It replaces the
guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9
retains, but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement
categories for financial assets: amortised cost, fair value through OCI and fair value through P&L. The
basis of classification depends on the entity’s business model and the contractual cash flow
characteristics of the financial asset. Investment in equity instruments are required to be measured at
fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes in fair value
in OCI no recycling. There is now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss
impairment model used in IAS 39. For financial liabilities there were no changes to classification and
measurement except for recognition of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income, for
liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. The standard is effective for accounting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early adoption permitted.


-----

The group has decided against early application of the following new or amended accounting
recommendations or interpretations that enter into force in or after 2015 as none of these is expected
to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the group. Below is a short
description of the new standards and interpretations:

IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014. It deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for
reporting useful information used to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and
uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity’s contracts with customers. The revenue
is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to direct the
use and obtain the benefits from the good and service. The standard replaces IAS 18 Revenue”. The
Standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 and earlier application is
permitted. The group is assessing the impact of IFRS 15.

**2.2** **Basis of consolidation**
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the group and its
subsidiaries as at 31 December 2014.

Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the group obtains
control, and continue to be consolidated until the date when such control ceases. The financial
statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company, using
consistent accounting policies. All intra-group balances, transactions, unrealised gains and losses
resulting from intra-group transactions and dividends are eliminated in full.

Total comprehensive income within a subsidiary is attributed to the non-controlling interest even if it
results in a deficit balance.

_Subsidiaries_
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Lindorff International AB and
entities where the group has controlling interest (subsidiaries). Controlling interest is achieved when the
Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain
benefits from its activities. The Company obtains and exercises control through direct or indirect voting
rights. Controlling interest will normally exist when the Company has voting rights of more than 50%
through ownership or agreements.

The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent
company, using consistent accounting policies. These financial statements are for consolidation
purposes restated to IFRS. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are
included in the consolidated income statement from the date of control is obtained and until the control
ceases. Intercompany transactions, balances, revenues and expenses are eliminated in consolidation.
This also applies for unrealized internal gains and losses.

The group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration
transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities
incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the group. The
consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent
consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities
assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the
fair value of non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If
this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference
is recognised in profit or loss.

There is a reassessment of the allocation of the acquisition price within 12 months after the acquisition
date when the initial accounting for a business combination can be determined only provisionally.


-----

**2.3** **Segment reporting**
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating
resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the CEO. The
operating businesses are organised and managed separately according to the nature of the products
and services provided, with each segment representing a strategic business unit that offers different
products and serves different markets.

The group is organised in two main operating segments: Debt Purchasing and Debt Collection. The
Debt Purchasing segment consists of acquisition and management of mainly unsecured
non-performing loans and receivables. The Debt Collection segment consists of collection for various
clients and on portfolios of loans and receivables owned by Debt Purchasing.

The Other group segment relates to the remaining head office expenses and amortisation of intangible
assets, as well as revenues not related to the operating segments.

The geographical areas specified represent 10% or more of the total revenue from external customers
and intersegment sales.

**2.4** **Foreign currency translation**
The consolidated financial statements are presented in EUR, which is the group’s presentation
currency.

Items included in the financial statements of each of the group’s entities are measured using the
currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”).

The results and financial position of all group entities that have a functional currency different from the
presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:

a) assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented (i.e. including
comparatives) are translated at the closing rate at the date of the financial position;

b) income and expenses for each income statement (i.e. including comparatives) are translated at
average exchange rates and

c) all exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income

Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency rate at the date of the
transaction or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting
from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at the year-end exchange rates of
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income
statement. Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents
are presented in income statement within “finance income or costs”. Foreign exchange gains and
losses on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities such as financial liabilities at fair value through
profit or loss are recognised in profit or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets
and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising are
recognised in other comprehensive income.

**2.5** **Tangible assets**
Tangible assets are recognised at cost, excluding the costs of day-to-day servicing, less accumulated
depreciation and accumulated impairment. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of such
tangible assets when that cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met. Depreciation is calculated
on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the assets. The useful lives of tangible assets, machinery
and fixtures are three to five years.

The carrying value of tangible assets is reviewed for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.


-----

An item of tangible assets is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are
expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as
the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in
the income statement in the year the asset is derecognised.

The asset’s residual values, useful lives and methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each
financial year-end.

**2.6** **Intangible assets**
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible
assets acquired in a business combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial
recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any
accumulated impairment losses. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or
indefinite. The group’s intangible assets are assessed to be finite except goodwill. Intangible assets with
finite lives are mainly amortised on a straight-line basis over the useful economic life and assessed for
impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation
period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least
at each financial year-end. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption
of future economic benefits embodied in the asset is accounted for by changing the amortisation period
or method, as appropriate, and treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense
on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the income statement as an expense and included
in “Amortisation of intangible fixed assets”.

_(a)_ _Goodwill_
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration
transferred over the group’s interest in net fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities of the acquiree and the fair value of the non-controlling interest in the acquiree.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the
acquisition date, allocated to each of the group’s cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating
units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to
which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the group at which the goodwill is
monitored for internal management purposes. The operating segment level is Debt Purchasing and
Debt Collection. However, when acquiring a company a PPA is prepared and the fair value of assets
and liabilities are allocated to the different assets. Loans and receivables are recognised at fair value
at the acquisition date. The goodwill allocated in full to the Debt Collection segment.

Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The carrying value of the goodwill is compared to the
recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal. Any
impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.

_(b)_ _Client relationships_
Client relationships include the rights related to collection contracts with a third party and got measured
on initial recognition at cost. Client relationships contract are amortised straight line over their useful
economic lives.

_(c)_ _Internally developed software_
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programs are recognised as an expense as
incurred. Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and
unique software products controlled by the group are recognised as intangible assets when the
following criteria are met:

– it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use;

– management intends to complete the software product and use it;

– there is an ability to use or sell the software product;


-----

– it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits;

– adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell
the software product are available; and the expenditure attributable to the software product during
its development can be reliably measured.

Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include employee costs
and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads.

Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as
incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a
subsequent period.

Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful
lives, which does not exceed five years unless strong indication of a longer useful life is demonstrated
(for instance by an underlying contract).

**2.7** **Impairment of non-financial assets**
Intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life or intangible assets not ready to use are not subject
to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s
carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s
fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are
grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows (cash-generating
units).

Prior impairments of non-financial assets other than goodwill are reviewed for possible reversal at each
reporting date. An assessment is made as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised
impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the
recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has
been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last
impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its
recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been
determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
After such a reversal the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s revised
carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.

**2.8** **Financial assets**
**2.8.1 Classification**
Financial assets in the scope of IAS 39 are classified as either as financial assets at fair value or at
amortised cost. Where assets are measured at fair value, gains and losses are either recognised
entirely in profit or loss (fair value through profit or loss, FVTPL), or recognised in other comprehensive
income (fair value through other comprehensive income, FVTOCI). The classification of a financial
asset is made by management at the time it is initially recognised, namely when the entity becomes a
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. If certain conditions are met, the classification of
an asset may subsequently need to be reclassified.

A financial asset shall be measured at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met:

(a) the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in
order to collect contractual cash flows and

(b) the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.


-----

A financial asset shall be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if both of the
following conditions are met:

(a) the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting
contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and

(b) the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

For debt instruments the FVTOCI classification is mandatory, unless the fair value option is elected.
While for equity investments, the FVTOCI classification is an election.

A financial asset shall be measured at fair value through profit or loss unless it is measured at amortised
cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income.

**2.8.2 Recognition and measurement**
At initial recognition, an entity shall measure a financial asset at its fair value plus or minus, in case of
a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to
the acquisition or issue of the financial asset.

Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have
expired or have been transferred and the group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of
ownership.

Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the “financial assets at fair value through
profit or loss” category are presented in the income statement within “Other (losses)/gains-net” in the
period in which they arise.

_Purchased loans and receivables_
Purchased loans and receivables are portfolios of non performing claims. A portfolio is defined to be the
lowest reliable level for pool of accounts with similar attributes. Typically, each portfolio consists of an
individual acquisition of accounts. Each portfolio is classified in the loans and receivable category and
is initially recorded at fair value including external cost of acquiring the portfolio. The portfolio is
accounted for as a single unit for the recognition of income, principal payments and adjustments from
recalculation of the estimated future cash flows.

The accounting policy is also applied when one or more portfolios are acquired in a business
combination.

Significant estimates are made by the management with respect to the collectability of future cash flows
from portfolios. The cash flow estimates are prepared by management on a rolling 15 year basis. If the
cash flow estimates are revised, the carrying amount is recalculated to reflect actual and revised
estimated cash flows by computing the present value of estimated future cash flows using the initial
effective interest rate. An adjustment in the carrying amount is recognised in net revenue. See
2.21 Revenue recognition for further information.

Management’s interpretations of historical cash flows, type of receivable, age, face value of the
individual account and experience from other portfolios form the basis for the cash flow estimates. As
these estimates are prepared on a rolling 15 year basis, an additional year is included in the 15 year
cash flow forecast each year. The effect of including an additional year is recorded as a revaluation in
the income statement. Actual results may differ from the estimates, making it reasonably possible that
a change in estimates could occur within one year and impact the carrying value of the related loans
and receivables. On a quarterly basis, management reviews the estimates of future cash flows, and
whether it is reasonably possible that its assessment of collectability may change based on actual
results and other factors that may have an impact on the estimates.

From time to time, the group acquires portfolios on a forward flow basis. This means that a contract is
established for purchases of debts at an agreed price, but where the volumes of debts are not fully
known at the time of agreement. The acquisition (delivery) of forward flow debts can be done on weekly,


-----

monthly or quarterly basis. The effective interest rate is calculated by contract and used for each batch.
If experience indicates a change in the attributes of the claims management may decide to apply a new
effective interest rate for new batches.

_Other financial assets_
Long-term loans and receivables and other receivables are those that arise when the company provides
money without the intent to trade its claim. If the anticipated maturity is longer than one year they
constitute long-term receivables, and if it is shorter they are short-term receivables. Loans and
receivables assessed at their discounted current value if their expected maturity exceeds 12 months. If
their maturities are shorter, they are assessed at cost.

**2.9** **Impairment of financial assets**
Under the impairment approach in IFS 39 it is no longer necessary for a credit event to have occurred
before credit losses are recognised. Instead, an entity always accounts for expected credit losses, and
changes in those expected credit losses. The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each
reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition and, consequently, more timely
information is provided about expected credit losses.

Purchased loans and receivables are treated differently because the asset is credit-impaired at initial
recognition. For these assets, group would recognize changes in lifetime expected losses since initial
recognition as a loss allowance with any changes recognized in profit or loss. Under the requirement,
any favourable changes for such assets are an impairment gain even if the resulting expected cash
flows of a financial asset exceed the estimated cash flows on initial recognition.

Evidence of changes in lifetime expected losses may include indications that the debtors or a group of
debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default of delinquency in interest or principal
payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization, and where
observable data indicate that there is a measurable decreases in the estimated future cash flows, such
as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults.

For loans and receivables category, the amount of the credit loss is measured as the difference
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted
at the financial asset’s initial effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the
amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement. If a loan has a variable interest
rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate
determined under the contract.

**2.10 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities**
Lock Lower Holding group uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge
its risks associated with interest rate. Such derivative financial instruments are initially and
subsequently measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive
and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value
on derivatives during the year are taken directly to the income statement.

**2.11 Trade and other receivables**
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers in the ordinary course of business. If collection is
expected in one year or less, they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as
non-current assets. Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured
at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any credit losses recognised.

Legal fees/bailiff costs: The group incurs outlays for bailiff/court costs, legal representation,
enforcement authorities, etc. which can be charged to and collected from debtors. In certain cases
Lindorff has agreements with its clients where expenses that cannot be collected from the debtor are
instead refunded by the client. The amount that is expected to be recovered from the client is
recognised as an asset in Other short term receivables.

Client funds: Client funds are reported as assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position and
comprise cash received on collection of a specific debt on behalf of a client and which are to be passed
on to the clients within a specified period.


-----

**2.12 Cash and cash equivalents**
Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and in hand and short-term
deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.

**2.13 Equity**
Share capital is determined using the nominal value of shares that have been issued. Additional paidin capital includes any premiums received on the initial issuing of the share capital. Any transaction
costs associated with the issuing of shares are deducted from additional paid-in capital, net of any
related income tax benefits. Retained earnings include all current and prior period results as disclosed
in the income statement.

**2.14 Trade payables**
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary
course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is
due within one year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest method.

**2.15 Borrowings**
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less
directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

The upfront fees are a part of the borrowing cost and are recognised as an expense in accordance with
the effective interest method.

**2.16 Borrowing costs**
Borrowing costs other than upfront fees are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are
incurred.

**2.17 Current and deferred income tax**
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income
statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or
directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in
equity, respectively.

_(a)_ _Current tax_
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively
enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the company and its subsidiaries operate and
generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect
to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions
where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected
to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.

_(b)_ _Deferred tax_
Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet
date between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting
purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:

– where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or
liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction,
affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and


-----

– in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries,
associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary
differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in
the foreseeable future.

Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of
unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be
available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry-forward of unused tax
credits and unused tax losses can be utilized except:

– where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from
the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and,
at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and

– in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries,
associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent
that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable
profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.

The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced
to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part
of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are
reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable
that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to
the year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have
been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity
and the same taxation authority.

**2.18 Employee benefits**
**a)** **Pension benefits**
The group has various post-employment schemes, including both defined benefit and defined
contribution pension plans.

**_Pension obligations_**
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the group pays fixed contributions into a
separate entity. The group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contribution if the fund
does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the
current and prior periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan.

Typically defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit than an employee will receive on
retirement, usually depended on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.

The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present
value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit
credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the
estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are
denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity
approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation. In countries where there is no deep market
in such bonds, the market rates on governments bonds are used.

Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions
are charged or credited in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.

Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income.


-----

For defined contribution plans, the group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered
pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The group has no further
payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as
employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the
extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.

**b)** **Termination benefits**
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the group before the normal
retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these
benefits. The group recognises termination benefits at the earlier of the following dates: a) when the
group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and b) when the entity recognises costs for a
restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 and involves the payment or termination benefits. In the
case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination benefits are measured based
on the number of employees expected to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than 12 months
after the end of the reporting period are discounted to their present value.

**c)** **Profit sharing and bonus plans**
The group recognizes a liability and an expense for bonus based on a formula that takes into
consideration the agreed terms.

**2.19 Provisions**
Provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of
a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required
to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where the
group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract,
the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually
certain. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the income statement net of any
reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a
current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting
is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a borrowing cost.

**2.20 Revenue recognition**
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received and represents interest and
amounts receivable for services supplied, stated net of discounts and value added taxes. The group
recognizes revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured; when it is probably that
future economic benefits will flow to the entity; and when specific criteria have been met for each of the
group’s activities, as described below.

a) Commission and debt collection fees in Collection are recognised on collection of the debt

b) Income from subscription services is recognised proportionally over the duration of the
agreement, usually one year

c) Income from other services are recognised when the service is provided

d) Revenue on portfolios of purchased loans and receivables are recognised using the effective
interest method

Purchased loans and receivables consists mainly of portfolios of delinquent consumer debts purchased
at prices significantly below the nominal face value and are recognised according to IFRS 9 for loans
and receivables, i.e. at amortised cost using the effective interest method. According to the effective
interest method, the carrying value of each portfolio corresponds to the present value of gross projected
future cash flows discounted by an initial effective interest rate determined on the date the portfolio was
acquired, and the method also allocates the interest revenue over the relevant period. The initial
effective interest rate is based on the relation between acquisition cost and the projected future cash
flows on the acquisition date.


-----

With the projection of future gross cash flows and the purchase price including transaction costs as a
basis, each portfolio is assigned an initial effective interest rate that is then used to discount cash flows
through the life of the portfolio. If appropriate, the EIR is reassessed and adjusted up to 12 months after
the purchase of the portfolio of overdue receivables to reflect refinements made to our estimates of
future cash flows based on enhanced data and analysis considered during that time period. This
adjustment has historically not resulted in any material impact on our income from purchased portfolios.

Current cash flow projections are monitored over the course of the year and updated based on, among
other things, achieved collection results, agreements reached with debtors on instalment plans and
macroeconomic information. Cash flow projections are made at portfolio level, since each portfolio of
receivables consists of homogeneous accounts. On the basis of the updated cash flow projections and
the initial effective interest rate, a new carrying value for the portfolio is calculated at the reporting date.

Changes over time in the book value can be divided into a time and interest rate component and a
component related to changes in estimates of future cash flows. Changes in cash flow forecasts are
treated symmetrically, i.e., both increases and decreases in forecast flows affect the portfolios’ book
value and, as a result net revenue.

Income on portfolios is accrued monthly based on each portfolios effective interest rate. Monthly cash
flows greater than the cash flow forecast for the same period is recorded as revenue in the period.
Likewise, monthly cash flows that are less than the monthly cash flow forecast for the same period is
recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period. Compensation received due to price adjustments for
portfolios acquired are recorded as an adjustment to the book value.

**2.21 Leases**
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor
are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income
statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

As of 31 December 2014 group has not recognised any finance leases.

**2.22 Dividend distribution**
Dividends proposed by the Board of Directors are not recorded in the financial statements until they
have been approved by the shareholders at the Shareholder’s General Meeting.

**2.23 Related parties**
Parties are related if one party has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise
significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Parties are also
related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence. All transactions between
the related parties are based on the principle of ‘arm’s length’ (estimated market value).

**2.24 Classification in the statement of financial position**
Current assets and short-term liabilities include items due less than one year from the balance sheet
date, and items tied to the operating cycle, if longer. The current portion of long-term debt is included
as current liabilities. Other assets are classified as non-current assets.

**2.25 Cash flow statement**
The indirect method is used for the cash flow statement. For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow
statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined in 2.12.

Cash related to acquisition of portfolios of loans and receivables is included in investing activities while
payments and amortisation on these portfolios are included in operating activities.

**3** **Critical accounting estimates**
Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances.


-----

The group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates
will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within
the next financial year are discussed below.

**Estimates and assumptions**

_Revenue recognition Purchased loans and receivables_
The group uses the effective interest rate method to account for portfolios and loans. The use of the
effective interest rate method requires the group to estimate future cash flows from loans and
receivables at each balance sheet date. The underlying estimates that form the basis for revenue
recognition depends on variables such as the ability to contact the debtor and reach an agreement,
timing of cash flows, general economic environment and statutory regulations. If the estimations are
revised, the group adjusts the carrying amount of the portfolios and loans to reflect actual and revised
estimated cash flows in accordance with IFRS 9 paragraph AG8. Events or changes in assumptions
and managements judgment will affect the recognition of revenue in the period.

_Book value of Purchased loans and receivables_
Loans and receivables (portfolios) consist mainly of acquired non-performing unsecured loans and nonderivative financial assets without fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market. Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Events or
changes in assumptions and managements judgment will affect the cash flow for the portfolios and
therefore also the net present value of future cash flows and the book value of the portfolios.

_Impairment of goodwill_
The group determines whether goodwill is impaired when circumstances indicate that there may be a
potential impairment. Estimating recoverable amounts of assets and companies are partly based on
management’s evaluation, including estimates of future performance, revenue generating capacity of
the assets, and assumptions of the future market conditions. Changes in circumstances and in
management’s estimation of future events may give rise to impairment losses.

Impairment of goodwill is evaluated on an annual basis and determined by assessing the recoverable
amount of the cash-generating unit (group of cash-generating units), to which the goodwill relates.
Estimating the recoverable amount requires the group to make assumptions regarding the expected
future cash flow and the discount rate used to calculate the net present value of those cash flows.

_Deferred Income Tax Assets_
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable
profit will be available against which the losses can be utilized. Significant management judgment is
required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely
timing and level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.

The group is subject to income taxes in some jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in
determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. There are transactions and calculations for which
the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit
issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these
matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current
and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.

**4    Financial risk management**
**4.1   Financial risk factors**
Group financial risk is limited, with strong cash flow from the Debt Purchasing business combined with
limited investments needed in the Third Party Collection business. Lindorff’s funding and financial risk
are managed within the group in accordance with the Treasury policy. The Treasury policy contains
rules for managing financial activities, measuring and identifying financial risk and limiting these risks.
Internal and external financial operations are concentrated in Group Treasury, which ensures
economies of scale when pricing financial transactions.


-----

The group’s activities are exposed to financial risk, market risk, currency risk, interest rate risk, credit
risk, liquidity risk and cash flow risk. The risk management guidelines set out in the Treasury policy aim
to reduce the effect of volatility in financial markets and the potential adverse effects that can have on
the group’s financial performance.

_a)    Market risk_
The services and products offered in the respective local geographical markets are subject to strict local
laws and regulations including requirements for debt collection licenses.

i)    Market and regulatory environment
The main market risk is related to general macroeconomic conditions and local rules and statutory
regulations in each of the geographical markets the group is present in and which affect the debtors’
ability to pay and the vendors’ ability and willingness to sell portfolios of loans and receivables and
potential commission from third party collection.

ii)    Foreign exchange risk
The group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various
currency exposures, primarily with respect to NOK (Norwegian krone) and SEK (Swedish krone)
compared to the group’s internal and external reporting currency EUR. Foreign exchange risk arises
from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign
operations.

The group’s strategy is to manage and limit currency risk. The following exchange rates have been used
to translate SEK and NOK in the financial accounts:

**NOK** **2014** **2013**
**–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––   –––––––––––     –––––––––––**
Average ......................................................................................................        8.35         7.80
Closing........................................................................................................        9.05         8.45

**SEK** **2014** **2013**
**–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––   –––––––––––     –––––––––––**
Average ......................................................................................................        9.10         8.65
Closing........................................................................................................        9.52         8.94

Exchange rate risk can be divided into transaction exposure and translation exposure.

The group has investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency
translation risk. Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the group’s foreign operations is
managed primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies.

**Transaction exposure**
In each country, revenues and operating expenses are mainly denominated in local currencies, and
thus currency fluctuations have only a limited impact on the company’s operating earnings in local
currency. National operations seldom have receivables and liabilities in foreign currency. Revenues and
expenses in national currency are thus hedged in a natural way, which limits transaction exposure.
The currency exposure that arises within the operating activities is limited to the extent it pertains to
international collection operations. The subsidiaries’ projected cash flow exposure is not hedged at
present.

At group level financing both the third party collection business and the capital business are funded in
the relevant currencies reflecting the underlying expected cash flow.

**Translation exposure**
The group operates in 12 countries. The results and financial position of subsidiaries are reported in the
relevant foreign currencies and later translated into EUR for inclusion in the consolidated financial
statements. Approximately 43% of the group’s revenue is in foreign currency. Consequently,
fluctuations in exchange rates against EUR affect the group’s revenues and earnings, as well as equity
and other items in its financial statements.


-----

The group’s revenues are distributed by currency as follows:

**EURm** **2014** **2013**
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––   –––––––––––     –––––––––––
EUR............................................................................................................        248          221
DKK ............................................................................................................         21           16
NOK............................................................................................................        142          150
SEK ............................................................................................................         59           56
Other currencies.........................................................................................          4            5

If currencies had weakened/strengthened by 10% in average against the presentation currency EUR
with all other variable held constant, net revenues would have decreased/increased by approximately
EUR 6m.

_b)    Interest rate risk_
Interest rate risks for Lindorff group relate primarily to the Lock Lower Holding group’s interest-bearing
net debt. The external debt amounted to EUR 1,759m at 31 December 2014. The funding consists of
bonds and a revolving credit facility. The bonds are a mix of fixed rate and floating rate bonds, share of
fixed rate bonds are 56%.

The floating rate bonds are tied to the market rate, with quarterly interest fixing. The Lock Lower Holding
group manages its interest rate risk by using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps. Such interest rate
swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates. Under the
interest rate swaps, the group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals (quarterly),
the difference between fixed contracts rates and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference
to the agreed notional amounts. The hedge ratio (fixed rate bonds + swaps) was 71% at 31 December
2014. A one-percent increase in market interest rates would have adversely affected net financial items
by approximately EUR 5m. A five-percent increase would have adversely affected net financial items by
approximately EUR 25m.

_c)    Credit risk_
Credit risk is the risk that Lindorff`s counterparties are unable to fulfil their obligations to the group.
Each local entity is responsible for managing and analysing the credit risk for each of their new clients
before standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. Credit risk arises from assets
such as cash and cash equivalents, guarantees and derivative financial instruments and deposits with
banks and financial institutions, as well as outstanding receivables; Purchased loans and receivables
and outlays on behalf of clients. For financial assets owned by Lindorff, no collateral (very limited) or
other credit reinforcements have been received.

The maximum credit exposure for each class of financial assets therefore corresponds to the carrying
amount.

There is also a limited risk of loss linked to the group’s Third Party Debt Collection, however the risk is
primarily carried by the client.

_Portfolios of purchased loans and receivables_
To minimize the risks related to purchase of non- performing claims, caution is exercised in purchase
decisions. Purchases are usually made from clients with whom the group has maintained long-term
relationships and therefore has a thorough understanding of the receivables in question. Purchased
loans and receivables are usually purchased at prices significantly below the nominal value of the
receivables, and are not collateralised. Lindorff retains the entire amount collected, including interest
and fees.

Lindorff has high yield requirements on purchased loans and receivables. Before every acquisition, a
careful assessment is made based on a projection of future cash flows (estimated gross collection less
expected costs of collection) from the portfolio. In its calculations, Lindorff is aided by its long
experience in collection management and its valuation models.


-----

Scoring entails the consumer’s payment capacity being assessed with the aid of statistical analysis.
Lindorff therefore believes that it has the expertise required to evaluate these types of receivables.

To facilitate the purchase of larger portfolios at attractive risk levels, Lindorff works in cooperation with
other companies, primarily in Spain. Risks are further diversified by acquiring receivables from clients
in different sectors and different countries

A share of the investments in purchased loans and receivables has been made as forward flow
agreements (see note 29), meaning that the group has committed to buy non-performing debt portfolios
for delivery in future periods. The duration of the contracts are usually not more than 12 months and for
the majority of contracts Lindorff has the possibility to decline to acquire the portfolios if the credit quality
of the claims are significant weaker than assumed in the agreement.

The group’s purchased loans and receivables include debtors in 12 countries and the carrying value is
distributed as follows:

Purchased loans and receivables are overdue at acquisition date and therefore usually purchased at
prices significantly below the nominal value. The average claim size at the end of 2014 was
approximately EUR 3,085. Even though it is obvious that the full face value will not be recovered, the
group has the right to collect the full face value including principal, interest and fees on its own behalf.

The carrying value of EUR 809m as at 31 December 2014, representing approximately 5% of face
value, is the maximum theoretical risk if the whole portfolio become worthless/non collectable.

The group has established long term relationship with large financial institutions in Europe. As a result
the distribution of carrying value of the portfolios of purchased loans and receivables by sector shows
that 89% are claims acquired from Banks and other financial institutions at the end of 2014.

The group has had only minor impairment losses and positive revaluations during the last year.

See note 14 re fair value of the portfolios of acquired loans and receivables.

In order to continue minimising the credit risk exposure, Lindorff continues to invest in staff with a broad
experience in credit management, and focus on increased analytical approach to portfolio
assessments. Monitoring processes are implemented to follow up actual collection compared to
forecasts. In addition, the group’s investment in effective IT systems and a more uniform cross-border
business model will result in better control of the group’s business, which in turn will also help reduce
the risk of credit loss.

_d)    Liquidity risk_
Liquidity risk is the risk that the group does not have the ability to fulfil its short and long-term payment
obligations to outside parties. The group’s long-term financing risk is minimized through long term
financing in the form of committed lines of credit. The group’s loan facilities ensure funding to meet
future payment obligations. As of 31 December the group held unused facilities totalling EUR 177m
(net of guarantees EUR 156m).

Cash flow forecasting is performed in the operating entities of the group and aggregated by Group
Treasury. Group Treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the group’s liquidity requirements to ensure it has
sufficient cash to meet operations needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn
committed borrowing facilities (note 23) at all times so that the group does not breach borrowing limits
or covenants (where applicable) on any of its borrowing facilities. Such forecasting takes into
consideration the group’s debt financial plans, covenant compliance, compliance with internal balance
sheet ratio targets and, if applicable external regulatory or legal requirement.

Surplus cash held by the operating entities over and above balance required for working capital
management is transferred to the Group Treasury (cash-pool). Group Treasury invests surplus cash in
interest bearing current accounts.

The table below shows the group’s non-derivative financial liabilities and net settled derivative financial
liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining periods at the balance sheet date to
the contractual maturity date. Derivative financial liabilities are included in the analysis if their
contractual maturities are essential for an understanding of the timing of the cash flows. The amounts
disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.

**4.2   Capital management**
The group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the group’s ability to continue as a
going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. In order
to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to
shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.

The gearing ratio is calculated as net interest bearing debt divided by adjusted EBITDA. Net interest
bearing debt is calculated as bonds and revolving credit less cash and cash equivalents. Adjusted
EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA adjusted for amortisation and revaluation of portfolios of purchased
loans and receivables.

Group’s external rating from Standard & Poor’s Rating Services is BB and from Moody’s Investor
Service is B2.

**5    Segment information**
Management has determined the operating segments based on information reviewed by management
for the purpose of allocating resources and assessing performance. Management considers the
performance from a product perspective and separately considers the Debt Purchasing and
Debt Collection.

Both segments meet the quantitative thresholds required by IFRS 8 for reportable segments.
Management assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of Contribution
Margin 1 which is gross revenues minus direct operating expenses.

**Revenue**
Sales between segments are carried out at arm’s length. The revenue from external parties reported to
management is measured in a manner consistent with that in the income statement. The following table
presents a reconciliation of the reportable segments’ main captions from profit and loss to the entity’s
profit and loss before tax:

**Expectations regarding effective tax rate**
The group is subject to varying income tax rates depending on local tax regulations in the relevant
country; hence Lindorff’s operations are subject to effective tax rates ranging from 15% to significantly
above the nominal tax rates. Several countries have implemented interest limitations rules which may
increase the effective tax rate going forward. This may be offset by lower nominal tax rates. In the longer
term, the effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 25%.

In some periods, tax losses (and interest) carried forward that are not recognised in the statement of
financial position will cause variations in the effective tax rate. In periods, when such assets are not
recognised, the effective tax rate will be higher than the long-term expectation, whereas it may be lower
in period when tax losses not recognised as assets have been utilised.

The group has substantial tax losses brought forward in the end of 2014. These have to a large extent
been generated by interest on shareholder loans in to the Lindorff Group prior to the acquisition in

Lindorff contests the claims and has filed complaints to the Tax Authorities in both countries. No
provisions have been recorded as Lindorff believes that our arguments are strong and hence our
standing in the disputes is solid.

**10   Fixtures and furniture**
Carrying value of fixtures and furniture were EUR 12m as at 31 December 2014 (6m). Acquisitions were
EUR 13m (3m) and depreciation EUR 1m (3m).

The assets are depreciated over the economic useful lives which are usually considered to be
3-5 years.

Client relations and goodwill (see note 12) are acquired in connection with business acquisitions. Client
relations include the rights related to collection contracts with a third party, and are amortised straight
line over their useful economic lives. Investment in client relationships in the reporting period amounted
to EUR 159m mainly related to an acquisition in Spain (Banco Sabadell carve-out), see note 30.

Amortisation is included in “depreciation and amortisation” costs for the year in income statement.

Goodwill is allocated to two operating segments: Debt Purchasing and Debt Collection which coincides
on which level Goodwill is monitored by management on group level. When acquiring a company a PPA
is prepared and the fair value of assets and liabilities is allocated to the different assets. Loans and
receivables are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date and the goodwill of EUR 758m has been
allocated in full to the Debt Collection segment.

Goodwill is tested for impairment on a yearly basis by comparing recoverable amount with carrying
value.

The transaction price when Lock AS acquired Lindorff group in October 2014 shows that there is no
need for write-down of the goodwill due to impairment. The decrease in carrying value is due to
translation effects only.

_Trade receivables_
The group’s trade receivables are related to clients in various industries and regions. The group’s
largest client accounts for less than 5% of revenues in 2014. Most accounts receivable outstanding are
with customers known to the group and whose creditworthiness is good and Lindorff has historically had
very limited losses on such receivables.

_Other short-term receivables_
Other short-term receivables consist mainly of accrued income not invoiced, web invoice receivables
and fee outlay, where customer is bearing the risk. It also includes other receivables, where credit risk
is considered to be low.

**14   Purchased loans and receivables**
Purchased loans and receivables are classified as loans and receivables and recognised at amortised
cost according to the effective interest method.

The group determines the carrying value by calculating the present value of estimated future cash flows
at the receivables’ initial effective interest rate. Adjustments are recognised in the income statement. In
the company’s opinion, the market’s yield requirements in the form of effective interest rates on new
portfolios have remained fairly constant despite turbulence in global financial markets in recent years.
The valuation method used results in the best estimate of the fair value of debt portfolios.

The carrying value of purchased loans and receivables:

The carrying value of Purchased loans and receivables recognised at amortised cost does not perfectly
match the fair value determined by discounting the net cash flow i.e. the gross cash receipts reduced
by the cost to collect discounted with a market based discount rate at every reporting date. The method
and result of the fair value estimation as at 31 December is illustrated below and shows a
non-significant deviation between the two valuation methods. The method falls within level 3 of the fair
value hierarchy.

**Fair value estimation of portfolios of purchased debt and receivables**
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (e.g. loans and
receivables) is determined by using valuation techniques such as net present value of estimated cash
flows. For loans and receivables, the discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital, which
is weighted value of the Group’s cost of debt and the cost of equity. The cost of equity is estimated by
applying the capital asset pricing model.

The preparation of cash flow estimates requires significant estimates to be made by management
regarding future cash flows from portfolios. The estimated future portfolio cash flows are reviewed by
management each quarter. The fair value is estimated to be approximately EUR 843m and is based on
net future estimated cash flows after tax, discounted with the estimated WACC for the Group. The
corresponding carrying amount is EUR 809m which is based on IAS 39 using the estimated gross future
cash flows, where the discount factor is the individual IRR for the each portfolio. The future cash flow
forecasts used to estimate the fair market value are the same as the cash flow forecast used in the
accounting for loans and receivables at 31 December 2014.

The fair value estimation is based on estimated annual net cash flows from portfolios. The estimated
annual net cash flows from portfolios is the assumed annual future collection on portfolios per country,
less assumed annual collection costs per portfolio before tax. Collection costs consist of operational
costs in the portfolio segment, i.e. commission to Debt Collection, payroll expenses, premises,
communication costs, depreciation and other costs directly attributable to the Debt Purchasing
segment. The collection costs as a percentage of the portfolio collection differ from portfolio to portfolio,
ranging from 5.0% to over 50.0%.

In addition, the country specific marginal tax rate is applied. This individual collection cost and tax rate
is applied to each portfolio’s estimated future cash flow, adding up to an estimated total net cash flow
for the Group.

The weighted average cost of capital after tax for the portfolio segment is estimated to 12% as at
31 December 2014 (details of the calculation is shown below). Based on this rate, the discounted value
of the estimated net cash flows indicates that the fair value of portfolios is approximately EUR 843m.

To evaluate this calculation, a sensitivity analysis of the cash flow estimates is presented in the table
below in order to see the effect of deviations to the cash flow estimates and variations in the cost of
capital.

The cost of capital after tax for the Portfolio segment is calculated using the capital asset pricing model
(CAPM) in combination with the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Based on the variables from
the table below, the estimated cost of capital after tax is approximately 12%.

_Risk free rate_
The risk free rate used in the calculation of the WACC is based on the 10 year Norwegian government
bond, which on 31st December was priced at 1.61%. However, the Group has a significant part of the
cash flows in other different currencies, the largest being EUR and SEK. The respective 10 year
government bond for these currencies range from 0.54% for EUR, 1.61% for NOK and 0.98% for SEK.
Given the fluctuations in the yield for these bonds we deem it reasonable and conservative to use the
Norwegian 10 year government bond as basis for the risk free rate for the Group. Calculating a currency
specific WACC for each currency, the risk free rate element would have reduced the WACC slightly
compared to the WACC estimated for the Group.

_Risk premium_
Based on empirical research done the long-term risk premium is about 6.7%. It is reasonable to assume
that the risk of investing in nonperforming loan portfolios is higher than observed average market risk
premium. Therefore a small cap premium risk premium of 9.74% is added to the calculation – resulting
in a total risk premium of 16.44%. These risk premiums are based on the research found by Ibbotson
Risk Premiums Over time Report

_Equity Beta_
The equity beta is based on 5 years of weekly observations for market peers. The calculations are
based on data from Bloomberg. We have then used this as a basis for our Beta re-levered.

_Future cash flow estimates_
The future cash flow estimates are based on the current 15 year IFRS forecast for the current asset
base with no value after this 15 year period. Therefore there are no adding cash flows from future
investments included in the fair value estimation.

In connection with Nordic Capital Fund VIII’s acquisition of Lindorff, which was completed on
6 October 2014, Lindorff International AB group’s bank funding package of EUR 840m was terminated
and replaced by funding from Lock AS which together with Lock Lower Holding AS established a new
funding package consisting of Super Senior RCF of EUR 255m, Senior Secured Bonds of
EUR 1,002.5m equivalent (issued in EUR and NOK) and Senior Notes of EUR 450m equivalent (issued
in EUR and SEK). EUR 1,119m of the funding package was on lent to Lindorff International AB. The
interest charged by Lock AS on the loans to Lindorff group reflects the external cost.

On 4 November an additional bond issue of EUR 250m was finalized. The issue was split between a
senior secured floating tranche of EUR 100m (EURIBOR + 5.5%) maturing in 2020, and a senior
secured fixed tranche of EUR 150m (7%) maturing in 2021. The proceeds of the issue were on lent to
Lindorff International AB and mainly used to settle the Spanish acquisition of EUR 159m and repay the
RCF draw.

The average interest rate on the notes is 7.4% with an average duration of 7 years. The SSRCF is
priced at a current margin of 3.50% with a commitment fee equivalent to 35% of the applicable margin
on any undrawn amount. The margin has a step down based on net leverage ratio. At year end the RCF
draw amounted to EUR 78m (excluding a draw for unfunded guarantees of 21m).

Covenants for bond package are typical for a 144A/Reg S high yield issue of this type, including but not
limited to, the following: Change of Control, Debt Incurrence, Permitted Liens, Limitation on Sales of
Assets & Subsidiary Stock, Limitation on Affiliate

Transactions, Limitation on Restricted Payments, Anti-layering, Reports, Merger and Consolidation,
Line of Business and Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains a Drawn Super Senior Leverage Ratio
financial covenant which will be tested for each annual accounting period and quarterly on a rolling
twelve month basis; The Financial Covenant is set at 2:1, (Drawn Super Senior Amount to Adjusted
EBITDA), with no step downs.

See Lock Lower Holding AS Annual report 2014 for additional information in regard to funding and
available liquidity.

**Security package**
Companies of the group representing more than 80% of EBITDA as of 31 December 2013 have
provided security for the RCF and the Bond package through pledge of shares, bank accounts,
receivables and a guarantee for the commitments under the RCF and the Bond package. Pursuant to
the Intercreditor Agreement, the liens securing the Senior Secured Notes will be senior liens over the
Senior Secured Notes Collateral that rank equally with the liens that secure: (i) on a super-priority basis
(A) obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and (B) obligations under certain
super-priority hedging arrangements; and (ii) on an equal and ratable basis, A) certain other future debt
permitted to be incurred under the Senior Secured Indenture, including certain acquisition indebtedness
and (B) obligations under certain hedging arrangements. The Senior Notes will be secured by the
Shared Collateral on a second-ranking basis.

**Convertibles**
Lindorff International AB has interest free convertibles towards Coinvest AB with a face value of
EUR 8.4m. Coinvest AB was included in the transaction where the Lindorff group was acquired by Lock
AS and is at 31 December 2014 owned by Lindorff Institutional Management AB which is owned by Indif
AB, the parent company of Lindorff International AB. The convertible debentures to Coinvest AB are due
for repayment at the latest on 31 January 2019. The convertibles can be settled by the company by
issuing a variable number of shares which means that there is no equity component and that the
instrument is recognised as a liability in full. The fair value of convertibles towards Coinvest AB is
estimated to EUR 42m for the year-ending 2014 (2013: 14m). The fair value is based on comparable
to trading multiples and is within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

**26   Post-employment benefits**
The group has pension liabilities for certain employees from defined benefit plans in Norway. The major
plans are covered by assets in funds administrated by insurance companies. The plans are final salary
pension plans, which provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable
for a specific number of years. The level of benefits provided depends on members’ length of service
and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement. The plans in Lindorff have been closed to
new employees since 2006. Pensions for new employees are instead based on defined contribution
plans.

The pension costs and pension liabilities for the defined benefit plans are presented below.

The plan assets consist primarily of investments in listed bonds. Due to the low net exposure there
would not be a significant impact on the financial position of the company due to reasonable changes
in the actuarial assumptions.

**Pension insurance with Alecta, Sweden**
Retirement pension and family pension obligations for salaried employees in Sweden are secured
through pension insurance with Alecta. This constitutes a multi-employer plan. For the 2014 fiscal year,
the company did not have access to such information that would enable the company to record this plan
as a defined benefit plan. Consequently, the ITP pension plan secured through insurance with Alecta is
recorded as a defined contribution plan. The contribution to the plan is determined based on the age,
salary and previously earned pension benefits of the plan participants. The expected contributions for
pension insurance taken out with Alecta for the next annual reporting period are expected to be in line
with current year which was EUR 0.4m. The group’s level of participation in the plan is insignificant.


-----

The collective consolidation ratio reflects the market value of Alecta’s assets as a percentage of
insurance obligations, calculated in accordance with Alecta’s actuarial assumptions, which do not
correspond with IAS 19. The collective solvency is normally allowed to vary between 125 and
155 percent. If the level of collective solvency is less than 125 percent or exceeds 155 percent,
measures are to be taken in order to create conditions for restoring the level of collective solvency to
the normal interval. Alecta’s surplus can be distributed to the policyholders and/or the insured if the
collective consolidation ratio exceeds 155 percent. However, Alecta aim to avoid surplus by using
reduced contributions. At December 31, 2014, Alecta’s surplus corresponded to a collective
consolidation ratio of 143 percent.

**Germany**
In addition there is a defined benefit plan for one employee in Germany. The net value of the plan is
positive and EUR 25k is recognised as a defined benefit asset.

**27   Provisions for other liabilities and charges**
The group had provisions for other liabilities of EUR 2m at the end of 2014 (2013: 1m).

**28   Pledged assets, contingent assets and liabilities**
The external funding of the group is secured through Lock AS and Lock Lower Holding AS.

Companies of the group representing more than 80% of EBITDA as of 31 December 2013 have
provided security for the RCF and the Bond package through pledge of shares, bank accounts,
receivables and a guarantee for the commitments under the RCF and the Bond package.

When conducting their business, the group companies are from time to time obliged to provide bank
guarantees to various government bodies or business parties. Such guarantees are backed by a
guarantee facility, which is part of the group’s funding through Lock AS. The guarantee facility amounts
to EUR 25m, where upon EUR 21m is currently utilized.

The book value of the share pledge amounts to:

**EURm** **2014** **2013**
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  –––––––––––     –––––––––––
Equity ...........................................................................................................       627          524
Cash and cash equivalents..........................................................................        68           52

As of 31 December 2014 there were no contingent assets. Contingent liabilities at the end of the
reporting period consist of tax disputes and are described in tax note 9.

During the normal business operations, the group faces from time to time claims in civil lawsuits and
disputes, most of which involve relatively limited amounts. None of these disputes is considered likely
to have any significant effect on the group or its financial position.

**29   Commitments**

**(a)   Capital commitments**
Capital expenditure contracted for at the end of the reporting period but not yet incurred is as follows:

**EURm** **2014** **2013**
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  –––––––––––     –––––––––––

The group has committed to buy non-performing debt portfolios for delivery in future periods (“forward
flow” contracts) from financial institutions and other vendors (where if significant in certain countries)
with an estimated purchase price of EUR 96m. The estimated face value and purchase price of the
majority of the contracts is based on previous acquisitions under the same contracts (20-60% of face
value) and are therefore reflecting the estimated business volumes for sale from the vendors under the
forward flow commitments.


-----

**(b)   Operating lease commitments—group company as lessee**
The group leases various offices under non-cancellable operating lease agreements. The lease terms
are between 5 and 10 years, and the majority of lease agreements are renewable at the end of the
lease period at market rate.

The group also leases various cars and machinery under cancellable operating lease agreements.
The group is required to give a six-month notice for the termination of these agreements. The lease
expenditure charged to the income statement during the year is disclosed under Other operating costs.

The future aggregated minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as
follows:

**EURm** **2014** **2013**

Banco Sabadell. The acquisition date was 22 December 2014 and the price was EUR 159m. The
agreement includes the provision of services for the management and collection of past-due
receivables by Lindorff, for an initial period of ten years. Lindorff has taken over 53 employees in
