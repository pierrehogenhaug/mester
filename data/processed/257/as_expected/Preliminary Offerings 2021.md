the manufacturers’ product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the securities described in the Offering
Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such securities is eligible counterparties and professional

(by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.
For the purposes of this provision, the term “manufacturers” shall mean such of the Initial Purchasers as are subject to the

Titan Holdings II B.V., a private company with limited liability (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) established under the laws of the Netherlands with its corporate seat (statutaire zetel)
in Amsterdam, the Netherlands and its registered office at Keizersgracht 555, 1017 DR Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and registered with the Dutch trade register under registration number 82416834 (the
“Issuer”), is offering (the “Offering”) €375,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its     % Senior Notes due 2029 (the “Notes”). The proceeds from the Offering will be used as part of the financing for the
proposed acquisition of the Titan Group (as defined herein). The Notes will bear interest at a rate of     % per annum. Interest will be paid on the Notes semi-annually on         and        , commencing
on        . The Notes will mature on        , 2029. At any time prior to        , 2024, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a portion of the Notes upon not less than 10 nor more
than 60 days’ notice by paying a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption
date, plus the relevant “make-whole” premium. At any time on or after        , 2024, the Issuer may redeem all or a portion of the Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at redemption
prices set forth in this preliminary offering memorandum (the “Offering Memorandum”), plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. Prior
to        , 2024, the Issuer may also redeem at its option up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the net proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price set
forth in this Offering Memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, provided that at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount
of such series remains outstanding immediately after the redemption. At any time prior to        , 2024, the Issuer may, during each twelve-month period commencing with the Issue Date, redeem up to
10% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any,
to, but excluding, the redemption date.

The Issuer may redeem all of the Notes, at any time, at a price equal to their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, upon the
occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law. Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of control,” the Issuer may be required to make an offer to repurchase the notes at 101% of the
principal amount redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. However, a change of control will not be deemed to have occurred if, pro forma for such change of control, a
specified consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event. In connection with a change of control offer for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount
of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such change of control offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a change of control offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases
all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer, or any third party making such a change of control offer in lieu of the Issuer, will have the right, upon prior notice to the holders,
to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal to the price paid to each other holder of Notes in such change of control offer, plus, to the extent not included in the change
of control offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

**Guarantor”) and, assuming completion of the Acquisition, either on or within 90 days following the Completion Date (as defined herein) and substantially simultaneously with the guarantees granted in favor**
of obligations under the Credit Facilities Agreement (as defined herein) by certain additional direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Issuer that guarantee the liabilities under the Credit Facilities Agreement (the
“Completion Guarantors” and the “Post-Completion Guarantors”, respectively).

(“Topco”), (b) receivables in respect of certain material intercompany loans owed to Topco and (c)
material bank accounts of the Issuer and (ii) second-priority security interests over (a) all of the issued share capital of Bidco held by the Issuer and (b) receivables in respect of certain material intercompany
loans owed to the Issuer by Bidco (the “Shared Collateral”). The Shared Collateral will also secure on a first-priority basis the liabilities under the Credit Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations,
and may also secure certain future indebtedness. The Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral will be subject to legal and contractual limitations. The Notes, the Guarantees and the security interests
over the Collateral will also be subject to restrictions on enforcement and other limitations under applicable laws and may be released under certain circumstances. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the
_Notes” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

by the Escrow Agent (as defined herein), and pledged on a first-ranking basis in favor of the Trustee (as defined herein) for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. The release of the Escrow Proceeds will be
subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the closing of the Acquisition. Consummation of the Acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including clearance of the EU
competition authority. If the Acquisition is not consummated by October 22, 2021 (the “Escrow Longstop Date”), or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory
redemption. The special mandatory redemption price will be a price equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, from the Issue Date
(as defined below) to but excluding the payment date of the special mandatory redemption. Please see “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

**Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) or the securities laws of any state of the United States or other**

**United States**

In making your purchase, you will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgments, representations and agreements
that are described in this Offering Memorandum. See “Transfer Restrictions.” This Offering Memorandum is being provided
to (1) a limited number of investors in the United States that the Issuer reasonably believes to be QIBs under Rule 144A for
informational use solely in connection with their consideration of the purchase of the Notes and (2) to non-U.S. persons outside
the United States pursuant to offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. Its use for any

distributed or any of its contents disclosed to anyone other than the prospective investors to whom it is originally submitted.

For this Offering, the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers are relying upon exemptions from registration under the

Act. Prospective investors are hereby notified that sellers of the Notes may be relying on the exemption from the registration
requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. The Notes may be offered and sold outside the United
States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Until 40 days after the later of (i) the commencement of this Offering
and (ii) the Issue Date of the Notes, an offer or sale of the Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating
in the Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in
accordance with Rule 144A or pursuant to another exemption from or in a transaction not subject to the registration
requirements of the Securities Act. For a description of certain restrictions on transfers of the Notes, see “Transfer Restrictions.”
Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S.

The Notes described in this Offering Memorandum have not been registered with, recommended by or approved by
the SEC, any state securities commission in the United States or any other securities commission or regulatory authority, nor

_Restrictions.”_

**_UK MiFIR Product Governance / Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market:_** Solely for the purposes of
the manufacturers’ product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the securities described in this Offering
Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such securities is eligible counterparties, as defined in the
FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No
600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all
channels for distribution of the securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person
subsequently offering, selling or recommending such securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the
manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, and without prejudice to the Issuer’s obligations in accordance with UK
MiFIR, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR
**Product Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such securities (by**
either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. For
the purposes of this provision, the term “manufacturers” shall mean such of the Initial Purchasers as are subject to the product
governance rules under COBS and UK MiFIR.

**_UK PRIIPS Regulation/Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors: The securities described in the Offering_**
Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise
made available to any “retail investor” in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one
(or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No. 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic
law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions
of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, as amended (the
“Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8)
of Article 2(1) of UK MiFIR; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation.
Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the securities described in the Offering
Memorandum or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United Kingdom has been prepared, and therefore,
offering or selling the securities described in the Offering Memorandum or otherwise making them available to any retail
investor in the United Kingdom may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the securities in the United Kingdom will
be made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation from a requirement to publish a prospectus for offers
of securities. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

**European Economic Area**

**_MiFID II Product Governance/Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market: Solely for the purposes of_**
the manufacturers’ product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the securities described in this Offering
Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such securities is eligible counterparties and professional
clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU, as amended (“MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such
securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. The target market and distribution channel(s) may
vary in relation to sales outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) in light of local regulatory regimes in force in the
relevant jurisdiction. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such securities (a “distributor”) should take
into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, and without prejudice to the Issuer’s obligations in
accordance with MiFID II, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in
respect of such securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining
appropriate distribution channels. For the purposes of this provision, the term “manufacturers” shall mean such of the Initial
Purchasers as are subject to the product governance rules under MiFID II.

**_PRIIPS Regulation/Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors: The securities described in the Offering_**
Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise
made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more)
of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance
Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1)
of MiFID II or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2(e) of the EU Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, no key
information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014, as amended (the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or
selling the securities described in the Offering Memorandum or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**Historical Financial Information**

The Issuer is a holding company formed for the purpose of facilitating the Acquisition and has not engaged in, and is
not expected to engage in, any activities other than those related to the Acquisition. The Issuer’s only material assets and
liabilities are currently, and are expected in the future to be, its interest in the issued and outstanding shares of its subsidiaries
and its outstanding indebtedness and intercompany balances incurred in connection with the Acquisition and the other
transactions described in the Offering Memorandum. We do not present in this Offering Memorandum any financial
information or financial statements of the Issuer.

The combined financial information of the Titan Group included in this Offering Memorandum has been extracted or
derived from:

(i) the unaudited interim condensed special purpose carve-out combined financial statements of the Titan Group
as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP (the
“Unaudited Interim Condensed Combined Financial Statements”); and

(ii) the audited special purpose carve-out combined financial statements of the Titan Group as of and for the years
ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit (the “Audited Combined Financial Statements”).

The Unaudited Interim Condensed Combined Financial Statements and the Audited Combined Financial Statements
are contained in the F-Pages to this Offering Memorandum and should be read in conjunction with the relevant notes thereto.

For a discussion of certain differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS, see Annex A. However, prospective investors
are also advised to consult their professional advisors for an understanding of: (i) the differences between US GAAP and other
systems of generally accepted accounting principles and how those differences might affect the financial information included
in this Offering Memorandum and (ii) the impact that future additions to, or amendments of, US GAAP or IFRS principles
may have on our results of operations and/or financial condition, as well as on the comparability of the prior periods and the
comparability of our financial information.

The Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements have
been prepared by combining and carving-out the assets, liabilities, income and expenses that Management have determined
relate to the Titan Group. Those amounts have been derived from the underlying financial records of the Crown European
Tinplate packaging business, which also include allocations and recharges by the Titan Group of indirect central costs and
general corporate expenses. The Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim
Financial Statements present, on a historical cost basis, the combined assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses related to the
Business constituting the Titan Group. Throughout the periods covered by the Audited Combined Financial Statements and the
Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements, the Titan Group, operated as a part of Crown. Consequently,
stand-alone financial statements have not been historically prepared for the Titan Group. The Audited Combined Financial
Statements and the Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements have been derived from Crown’s historical
accounting records and as if the Titan Group operated on a stand-alone basis. The Audited Combined Financial Statements and
the Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements include the historical operations, assets and liabilities of the
legal entities and components of legal entities that are considered to comprise Titan Group’s Business. The Combined Statement
of Operations include all revenues and costs directly attributable to Titan Group, including costs for facilities, functions and
services used by the Titan Group. Crown uses a centralized approach to cash management and financing most of its operations.
Accordingly, the cash and cash equivalents included on the Combined Balance Sheets represents cash balances specifically
attributable to the Titan Group at the end of each reporting period. The allocations and estimates in the Audited Combined
Financial Statements and the Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements are based on assumptions that
Management believes are reasonable.

The assets, liabilities, income and expenses that the directors have determined relate to the Titan Group include all
those that are directly attributable and/or separately identifiable to the Titan Group, together with an allocation of the items that
are not. Certain estimates, judgments and assumptions have been made for the purpose of allocating items to the Financial
Statements that are not directly attributable and/or separately identifiable.


-----

The Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial
Statements do not necessarily reflect the Titan Group’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows had the Titan
Group been a separate entity, or the future results of the Titan Group as it will exist upon the completion of the separation from
Crown.

Historical financial information is not necessarily indicative of future expected results.

**Impact of the Acquisition**

The Audited Combined Financial Statements and Unaudited Interim Condensed Combined Financial Statements in
this Offering Memorandum have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of any changes to the combined statements of
operations, combined statements of comprehensive income, combined statements of cash flows and combined statements of
changes in shareholders’ equity that might occur as a result of the purchase price allocation (“PPA”) to be applied as a result
of the Acquisition. The application of PPA adjustments could result in different carrying values for existing assets and assets
we may add to our statement of financial position, which may include intangible assets, such as goodwill, brands, rights of use,
contractual rights with franchisees leasehold rights and software, and different amortization and depreciation expenses. Due to
these and other potential adjustments, our future financial statements could be materially different from the Audited Combined
Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Condensed Combined Financial Statements included in this Offering
Memorandum, once the PPA adjustments have been made.

**Last Twelve Months Ended March 31, 2021**

The financial information included in this Offering Memorandum for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021 is
calculated by taking the results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and adding to them the difference
between the results of operations for the full year ended December 31, 2020 and the three months ended March 31, 2020. The
financial information for the three and twelve months ended March 31, 2021, is not necessarily indicative of the results that
may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2021 and should not be used as the basis for or prediction of an annualized
calculation.

**Convenience Translation**

The Audited Combined Financial Statements and Unaudited Interim Condensed Combined Financial Statements were
prepared in US Dollar, which is the presentational currency of Crown. However, we may report our financial results in euros
in the future. As a result, certain financial information included in this Offering Memorandum is presented using a convenience
translation of our US Dollar -denominated Financial Statements into euros on the basis of the following exchange rates, which
have been derived from Titan Group’s accounting systems:

**Income and Cash**

**Flow Statement**

**Period** **Data (incl. APMs)** **Balance Sheet Data**

_US Dollar per €1.00_
Year ended December 31, 2018........................................................ 1.1814 1.1460
Year ended December 31, 2019........................................................ 1.1196 1.1217
Year ended December 31, 2020........................................................ 1.1413 1.2212
Three months ended March 31, 2020......................................... ...... 1.1022 1.1006
Three months ended March 31, 2021......................................... ...... 1.2056 1.1728
Twelve months ended March 31, 2021............................................. N/A* 1.1728

**Note: The figures presented in the convenience translation for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021 are calculated by taking the results of operations for**
the three months ended March 31, 2021 from the convenience translation and adding to them the difference between the results of operations for the
full year ended December 31, 2020 and the three months ended March 31, 2020, in each case from the convenience translation. The convenience
translation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by using the US Dollar to euro exchange rate of 1.162, which represents the average exchange
rate for the twelve months period ended March 31, 2021 based on market observable rates.

The rates used to provide the convenience translation may differ from the actual rates used in the preparation of the
Financial Statements. You should not view the convenience translation as a representation of what our results would have
been had our reporting currency been euro during the applicable periods. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Acquisition—We have no operating history as a standalone company.”_

**Alternative performance measures (“APMs”)**

This Offering Memorandum contains financial measures that are not defined or recognized under US GAAP including:

**_Adjusted EBITDA: We calculate Adjusted EBITDA by applying adjustments for non-operating or non-recurring_**
items to EBITDA.

**_EBITDA: We calculate EBITDA as net income before provision of income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and_**
amortization.

**_Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA: We calculate Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA by applying adjustments for the benefit_**
of cost savings from operational improvement opportunities that we expect to realize within the next three years.

**_Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin: We calculate Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin_** as Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA divided by net sales.

We present these APMs because we believe that the APMs contribute to a better understanding of our results of
operations by providing additional information on what we consider some of the drivers of our financial performance.
Furthermore, we believe that these APMs are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties
as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity.

In addition, the presentation of these measures is not intended to and does not comply with the reporting requirements
of the SEC; compliance with its requirements would require us to make changes to the presentation of this information.
However, the Company believes that the description of these APMs in this offering memorandum follows and complies with
the European Securities and Markets Authority Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures (APM) dated October 5,
2015.

APMs should not be considered in isolation and investors should not consider such information as alternatives to
revenue, profit before tax or cash flows from operations calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as indications of operating
performance or as measures of the Company’s profitability or liquidity. Such financial information must be considered only in
addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial information prepared in accordance with US GAAP included
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these APMs and are also
advised to review them in conjunction with the Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Condensed
Combined Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, the Issuer’s computation of
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin and other APMs may not
be comparable to similarly-titled measures or ratios used by other companies.

We believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
margin are meaningful for investors because they provide an analysis of our operating results, profitability and ability to service
debt and because they are used by our chief operating decision makers to track our business evolution, establish operational
and strategic targets and make important business decisions.

For the reconciliation to an appropriate measure calculated in accordance with US GAAP of the APMs included in
this Offering Memorandum, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
_Alternative Performance Measures (“APMs”)” and “Summary Financial and Other Information.”_

**Adjusted pro forma financial information**

The Issuer presents in this Offering Memorandum certain adjusted pro forma financial information to give effect to
the Transactions. The adjustments made in order to present the financial information on an adjusted pro forma basis to give
effect to the Transactions have been made based on available information and assumptions that management believes are
reasonable. The adjusted pro forma financial information is for information purposes only and does not necessarily present
what our results would actually have been had the offering of the Notes and the other Transactions actually occurred on March
31, 2020 or the Completion Date, respectively, nor should it be used as the basis of projections of results of operations or
financial condition for any future period.


-----

**Rounding**

Certain monetary amounts, percentages and other figures included in this Offering Memorandum have been subject
to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, figures shown as totals in certain tables may not be the arithmetic aggregation of the
figures that precede them, and figures expressed as percentages in the text may not total 100% or, as applicable, when
aggregated may not be the arithmetic aggregation of the percentages that precede them.

**Market and Industry Data**

In this Offering Memorandum, we rely on and refer to information regarding our business and the markets in which
we operate and compete. Such data and certain industry forward-looking statements are derived from various industry and
other independent sources, where available. In particular, certain information has been derived from Metal Packaging Europe,
Can Manufacturing Institute, Smithers Information Ltd (“Smithers”), Wall Street equity research and a leading global
consulting firm. The information in this Offering Memorandum that has been sourced from third parties has been accurately
reproduced and, as far as we are aware and able to ascertain from the information published by such third parties, no facts have
been omitted that would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading. Unless otherwise stated, industry data in
this Offering Memorandum from such sources was sourced at various points in time, and, in each instance, reflects the data
available at such point in time and does not reflect further updates after it was sourced. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such
third party information has not been independently verified, and neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation
or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of such information set forth in this Offering Memorandum. Market studies and
analyses are frequently based on information and assumptions that may not be accurate or technically correct, and their
methodology is by nature forward-looking and speculative. Such data, statistics and other information are based on market
research, which itself is based on sampling and subjective judgments by both the researchers and the respondents, including
judgments about what types of products and transactions should be included in the relevant market. In addition, the value of
comparisons of data and statistics for different markets is limited by many factors, including that (i) the markets are defined
differently, (ii) the underlying information was gathered by different methods and (iii) different assumptions were applied in
compiling the data and statistics. The data reports may not accurately reflect certain aspects of the current market and industry,
and in particular, the data reports may no longer be accurate or relevant to current expectations as they may not, or may not
fully, contemplate or therefore factor in the ultimate effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Third party sources explicitly
disclaim any liability for any loss or damage, howsoever caused, arising from any errors, omissions or reliance on any
information or views contained in their reports.

In addition, certain information in this Offering Memorandum for which no source is given, regarding our market
position relative to our competitors, is not based on published statistical data or information obtained from independent third
parties. Such information and statements reflect our best estimates based upon information obtained from trade and business
organizations and associations and other contacts within the industries in which we compete, as well as information published
by our competitors. To the extent that no source is given for information contained in this Offering Memorandum, or such
information is identified as being our belief, that information is based on our experience, our evaluation of industry information,
our determination of our addressable markets and our own investigation of market conditions including on the following: (i) in
respect of market share, information obtained from third party sources, trade and business organizations and associations and
other contacts within the industries in which we compete and internal analysis of our sales data and the data publicly available
in the financial statements of our main competitors, and unless otherwise stated, market share is based on volume; (ii) in respect
of industry trends, our senior management team’s general business experience, as well as their experience in our industry and
the local markets in which we operate; and (iii) in respect of the performance of our operations, our internal analysis of our
audited and unaudited financial and other information. As some of the foregoing information was compiled or provided by our
management or advisers and is not publicly available, such information accordingly may not be considered to be as independent
as that provided by other third party sources. We nevertheless believe that our own market observations are reliable. We give
no warranty for the accuracy of our own estimates and the information derived from them. They may differ from estimates
made by our competitors or from future studies conducted by market research institutes or other independent sources.

**Tax Considerations**

Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisers as to the consequences of purchasing,
holding and disposing of the Notes, including, without limitation, the application of U.S. Federal tax laws to their particular
situations, as well as any consequences to them under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction, including the Netherlands, and
the consequences of purchasing the Notes at a price other than the initial issue price in the Offering. See “Certain Tax
_Considerations.”_

**SUMMARY**

_This summary highlights information contained elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The summary below does_
_not contain all the information that you should consider before investing in the Notes. You should read the entire Offering_
_Memorandum carefully, including the Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Combined Financial_
_Statements, including the notes thereto, before making an investment decision. See “Risk Factors” for factors that you should_
_consider before investing in the Notes._

**Overview**

We are a European leader in the design, manufacture and sale of metal packaging solutions, with number one or
number two market positions across our product groups in the countries we operate in. We are the clear market leader in the
26.7-billion-unit European market for metal food cans and ends, holding the number one market position with an approximate
39% market share based on volume in the year ended December 31, 2020. As the largest European manufacturer of metal food
cans and ends and the largest European buyer of tinplate steel (based on our estimated consumption of approximately 20% of
total European tinplate production), our business is a critical asset in the European food supply chain.

We have been in the industry for more than 200 years and have an established reputation for the highest quality
products and exceptional customer service. From the founding of our predecessor business in 1799 to our acquisition by Crown
in 1996 and our acquisition of Mivisa in 2014, our business has shown itself to be a leader in European metal packaging time
and time again. Following the Transactions, we will become a leading stand-alone business in Europe.

Our product portfolio consists predominantly of food packaging, with approximately 95% of our sales in the year
ended December 31, 2020 going to food related end markets. Our products are used by hundreds of millions of consumers on
a daily basis across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we produced approximately 12
billion food cans, approximately 24 billion ends, approximately 5.3 billion metal closures, approximately 581 million aerosol
cans and approximately 134 million metal promotional packaging containers. Our products are used to package food in a
diverse array of end-markets, including fruits and vegetables, tomatoes, fish, pet food, culinary, infant nutrition and dairy. Each
of our end-markets is driven by fundamental demand drivers that are stable and largely uncorrelated with broader
macroeconomic cycles.

**Note: For the year ended December 31, 2020**
1. According to leading global consulting firm
2. According to Management estimates

We sell our products in more than 90 countries with France, Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy and Germany
representing 15%, 14%, 12%, 11% and 7% of our sales, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2020 and other
geographies making up the remaining 41% of sales in the same period. Sales to our top 10 customers represented just 32% of
our total sales in the year ended December 31, 2020. We benefit from long-standing relationships with our customers, having
worked with our top 10 customers for an average of over 25 years.

Our business is significantly insulated from raw material price fluctuation through a combination of formulaic and
negotiated raw material pass-through mechanisms, providing us with margin stability and consistent historical cash flows. We
have demonstrated our ability to pass through fluctuations in the prices of our raw material inputs over the long term. Moreover,
as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, Titan Group’s pass-through was on track for full recovery of raw material price
increases in 2021. Based on Management estimates, the vast majority of sales are covered by at least annual contracts, with up


-----

to 40% of total sales secured on multi-year contracts. Our customer contracts provide sales volume visibility, as many contracts
stipulate a guaranteed percentage of total customer orders for the term of the contract.

We operate 44 strategically located manufacturing facilities (in addition to the Braunstone site, which will be
transferred at the end of the transition period) in 17 countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, which enhance our access
to customer end-markets and support local demand. Our manufacturing scale is complemented by our services and customer
support capabilities including over 20 technical services locations, seven dedicated product design studios, four dedicated
laboratory testing facilities and a world-class research and development facility that have put us at the forefront of the European
tinplate packaging industry.

In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, we had net sales of $2,241 million, $2,138 million and $2,227
million, respectively, and Adjusted EBITDA of $303 million, $247 million and $267 million, respectively. Our net sales and
Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA were $2,297 million and $317 million, respectively, for the twelve months ended March 31,
2021. These amounts translate, for convenience purposes only, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, to net
sales of €1,897 million, €1,910 million and €1,951 million, respectively, and Adjusted EBITDA of €256 million, €221 million
and €234 million, respectively, and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, to net sales and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
of €1,974 million and €272 million, respectively.

**Strengths**

**_1. Longstanding European market leader and critical asset in the European food packaging supply chain_**

We are the clear leader in the European market for food cans and ends, holding the number one market position with
an approximate 39% market share based on volume in the year ended December 31, 2020. Sales of metal food cans and ends
represented 85% of our total revenue in this period. We also believe that we hold the number one or number two market position
in Europe across the other product categories we serve, namely metal closures, aerosol cans and promotional containers with
market shares of approximately 28%, 12% and 24%, respectively, measured by volume for the year ended December 31, 2020.
We have been in the European market for over 200 years and have a reputation with customers for providing the highest quality
products and superior service.

In the year ended December 31, 2020, we produced approximately 12 billion food cans, approximately 24 billion
ends, approximately 5.3 billion metal closures, approximately 581 million aerosol cans and approximately 134 million metal
promotional packaging containers. Including intermediate precursor products, our manufacturing assets produce 500 million
products per day on average. We have a well-established manufacturing presence with 44 strategically located manufacturing
facilities (in addition to the Braunstone site, which will be transferred at the end of the transition period) across 17 countries
enhancing access to customers, end markets, local demand and suppliers. We operate 34 food cans & ends manufacturing
facilities (in addition to the Braunstone site, which will be transferred at the end of the transition period), five closures
manufacturing facilities, three aerosol manufacturing facilities and three promotional packaging manufacturing facilities. We
have a well-invested asset base supported by in-house research and development expertise. We believe the investment required
to replicate our facility footprint, in addition to the know-how of operating canmaking assets that we developed over our history
create high barriers to entry.

The European market for food cans and ends is mature and highly consolidated with the top two players, ourselves
and our primary competitor, holding a combined market share of over 65% based on volume in the year ended December 31,
2020. The third largest manufacturer has a market share of 3%. Other competitors consist of mostly regional or local
manufacturers, who lack the ability to serve larger food customers at scale or are limited in their ability to serve customers
across multiple geographies. The European food cans and ends market is relatively insulated from import competition given
the high cost of shipping metal packaging long distances and the short lead times customers demand. Due to the significance
of transportation costs in the food can industry, our regional production capabilities support expedient and cost-efficient
transportation to local customers. Furthermore, there are high barriers to entry due to sizeable capital requirements needed to
add capacity, rigorous qualification requirements demanded by customers, and heightened scrutiny with respect to safety
requirements as a result of serving sensitive food end-markets.

We hold a critical position in the European food packaging supply chain as the largest European manufacturer of metal
food cans and ends and the largest European buyer of tinplate steel. Our business is the key link between tinplate steel, a
commodity raw material that we purchase and convert to finished packaging for our large and fragmented, primarily European,
customer base of food manufacturers. Can producers are the largest consumers of tinplate steel in Europe, with approximately
90% of tinplate steel in Europe being used in packaging, of which 40 to 50% is for food cans and 10 to 15% is for each of
beverages, general line, aerosols and closures. Moreover, the market is largely stable with no significant shifts expected. We


-----

are Europe’s largest buyer of tinplate, consuming approximately 20% of all tinplate production in Europe in 2020 according to
Management estimates. Tinplate steel suppliers rely on us for a stable source of demand, and our position as the largest
consumer of tinplate steel makes us a critical partner to all of the major suppliers of tinplate steel in the European market. Our
over 1,000 customers rely on us as Europe’s largest supplier of food cans and ends. Because of our scale, we are often the only
supplier that can serve high volume customers on a pan-European basis. Our customers depend on our supply to go to market
and rely on our packaging to ensure their products reach store shelves. We provide their products with the benefit of a long
shelf life that metal food cans offer. Our packaging is an important part of our customers’ brands, and we work closely with
our customers to develop designs that ensure their products are attractive to end-consumers at points of sale.

**_2. Diverse, stable revenue mix with exposure to a range of non-cyclical, food-related end markets_**

We sell essential food packaging products into a highly diverse mix of geographies, customers and end-markets, which
supports revenue stability and resilience. Our products serve over 90 countries consisting of both sales into mature, developed
countries and higher growth, developing countries. No single country represented more than 15% of our sales in the year ended
December 31, 2020, with the largest contributors being France, Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy and Germany at 15%, 14%,
12%, 11% and 7% of sales, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2020.

Our product portfolio consists 95% of food packaging, which has historically experienced stable demand throughout
economic cycles. We serve numerous food-related end-markets, including shelf-stable fruit and vegetables, shelf-stable fish,
culinary (such as baked beans), pet food and infant formula, which represented 24%, 18%, 11%, 8% and 8% of sales,
respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2020. Each of our end-markets is driven by fundamental demand drivers, such as
population growth, eating at home trends, urbanization, and a growing global middle class, that are stable and largely
uncorrelated with broader macroeconomic cycles, and not subject to significant innovation threats.

**Note: For the year ended December 31, 2020**

Metal cans represent the best barrier material and provide a shelf life of over two years while still retaining the
freshness of the food being packaged. In addition, metal food cans provide a host of other benefits to our customers, including
i) allowing for fast filling speeds with limited loss, ii) having high strength and allowing for ease of handling and iii) being
resistant to corrosion, thereby allowing for high-acid contents (e.g., tomatoes). These qualities make our products highly costeffective solutions for our customers and limit the threat of substitution from other substrates.


-----

The stability of our end-markets is evidenced by their historical and forecast growth rates. According to a leading
global consulting firm market growth for the packaging of shelf stable vegetables, culinary products, infant nutrition products
and shelf stable fish in Europe have each fluctuated by CAGRs of less than +/-1.5% between 2015 and 2020, and are expected
to fluctuate by CAGRs of less than +/-1.5% between 2020 and 2024. Furthermore, between 2015 and 2020 the food can volumes
sold in Iberia grew by a CAGR of 2% and in our other key markets of France, Italy, the UK and Germany food can volumes
fluctuated by a CAGR of less than +/-1.5% over this period.

**_3. Diverse, blue-chip customer base with longstanding, contractual relationships_**

We supply over 1,000 customers across a range of resilient product categories and end markets. No single customer
represented more than 8% of our sales in the year ended December 31, 2020, with our top 10 customers representing 32% of
sales for the same period. Our customers include blue-chip, global food and consumer businesses including Abbott, Bonduelle,
Danone, Nestle and Unilever, large national and regional food companies, as well as many smaller and independent fisheries
and farmers. We benefit from long-standing relationships with our customers, having worked with our top 10 customers on
average for over 25 years. We are the sole or main supplier for several of our top customers. We believe that the quality of our
products, our track record of providing reliable supply proven over decades and the significant costs to customers involved in
switching manufacturers creates customer stickiness. Before a manufacturing plant or line can begin manufacturing new can
SKUs for a customer, its products typically must be qualified through a process that can take several months to over a year. In
addition, can manufacturers may face downtime on their lines when running new SKUs, thereby impacting customers’ security
and reliability of supply. Customers who decide to change manufacturers also typically lose the benefit of volume rebates from
former suppliers and face uncertainty regarding the stability, reliability and quality of their new partners.

Customers praise our technological know-how, understanding of their requirements and ability to produce and deliver
large volumes of specialty food cans consistently on time and in full. Our customers incur high costs if their packaging is not
delivered when required. As an example, tomatoes must be sealed in their packaging within six hours of being picked to ensure
their freshness, often requiring our manufacturing facilities to ship dozens of truckloads of food cans per day in a continuous
rotation to certain customer facilities during harvest season. We are recognized as an industry leader in product development
and deliver solutions that offer greater consumer convenience and functionality in response to market demands. Can fillers
require producers who can satisfy their branding, quality and safety needs. We believe we consistently satisfy these needs and
enable our customers to differentiate their brands through packaging and address changing safety requirements ahead of time.

**_4. Sustainability- and consumer-driven tailwinds benefit metal packaging_**

Our metal packaging products are favorably positioned to benefit from the increase in demand for sustainable
packaging given their infinitely recyclable nature. Greater environmental consciousness and strong sustainability trends are
expected to support an increased preference for metal packaging over the long-term. End consumers increasingly view
sustainability as a key purchasing criteria and seek out more environmentally friendly packaging. Food producers – our
customers – are aggressively responding to this demand. For example, several major food conglomerates have announced that
they aim to sell mostly recyclable or reusable materials by 2025. These trends are further reinforced by regulatory
developments. For example, the EU circular economy plan adopted in 2020 has a clear focus on recyclable packaging, which
is likely to put pressure on plastic in favor of other packaging materials. Metal packaging provides excellent options for the
sustainability initiatives of companies and brands, since metal properties do not degrade during use or recycling. Consumers
already recognize metal packaging as a highly recyclable substrate, evidenced by recycling rates of over 80% for steel and 75%
for aluminum in Europe, and food brands increasingly want to position themselves as environmentally friendly.

As a further sustainability benefit, metal packaging’s superior barrier properties make it ideal for food preservation,
which reduces food waste. Metal packaging increases the accessibility of healthy foods in an economical manner and provides
contamination protection, thereby reducing the prevalence of food-borne illnesses.

Within the metal packaging industry, we are a European leader in sustainability awareness as a Co-Founder of the
Metal Packaging Europe Association and an active participant in other major sustainability focused associations, which serve
as conduits for sustainability reform at the regulatory and legislative level.

**_5. Attractive financial profile with flexible cost structure and ability to generate consistent free cash flow_**

We have a strong track-record of robust free cash flow generation and cash conversion as a result of our flexible cost
structure and resilient cash flows. We generated average annual free cash flow of $239 million and an average cash conversion
rate of approximately 88% from 2018 to 2020.


-----

Our business is significantly insulated from raw material price fluctuation through a combination of formulaic and
negotiated pass-through mechanisms, providing us with consistent historical cash flows and supporting our margins. We have
demonstrated our ability to pass through fluctuations in the prices of our raw material inputs over the long term. Based on
Management estimates, the vast majority of sales are covered by at least annual contracts, with up to 40% of total sales secured
on multi-year contracts. Our customer contracts provide sales volume visibility, as many contracts stipulate a guaranteed
percentage of total customer orders for the term of the contract. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, over 97% of
Titan Group’s pricing for 2021 was already agreed.

We estimate that approximately 87% of our cost base is fully- or semi-variable, consisting mostly of material costs,
labor costs, freight, energy, which represented 61%, 15%, 5% and 3%, respectively, of our total costs for the year ended
December 31, 2020 in addition to other consumables. The semi-variable characteristics of our labor costs come from our ability
to reduce our labor costs through the use of seasonal and temporary employees. Our variable cost structure allows us to quickly
adapt our production capacity to harvest cycles, which can result in modest volume fluctuations from year to year.

Our cash flow stability is bolstered by the non-cyclical end-markets we serve, our ability to pass-through raw material
prices changes, our long-term customer relationships with contracted volumes, and customer stickiness. Our modest capital
expenditure requirements and well-managed, disciplined approach to working capital further strengthen our free cash flow
conversion. We believe our free cash flow profile will enable us to reduce leverage through debt repayment over time.

**_6. Experienced management team supported by a best-in-class financial sponsor_**

We benefit from a talented management team with deep roots in the business and decades of experience. Our
management team has a strong track-record of value creation in the consumer packaging industry and has an average 30 years
of service in the industry.

Our management team has been involved in the preparation of our transition from being a part of Crown to operating
as a stand-alone business, including the development of our stand-alone strategy. We have also moved to reinforce the team in
its new existence as a stand-alone company by announcing the appointment of Tomás López as Chief Executive Officer. Mr
López will bring experience and a track-record of success in managing Mivisa before it was acquired by Crown. See also
“Management.”

KPS Capital Partners (“KPS”) has a strong track-record of realising improvements in manufacturing companies and
over two decades of constructive investing in highly complex corporate carve-outs on a global basis. KPS creates value for its
investors by working constructively with talented management teams to make businesses better, and generates investment
returns by structurally improving the strategic position, competitiveness and profitability of its portfolio companies, rather than
primarily relying on financial leverage. KPS will support management and leverage its core operational improvement expertise.
Furthermore, Crown will retain a 20% equity stake in the stand-alone company, validating its belief in the potential of the
business and allow for a smooth transition of the business to an independent company.

**Strategy**

Our strong cash flow generation has historically been utilized in support of broader goals within the larger Crown
organization. We have a unique position in the European food supply chain as the largest manufacturer of food cans and ends
in Europe and we believe that we are the largest buyer of tinplate steel in Europe. We believe that, despite our market position,
our historic margins have lagged those of key competitors and our own potential as a result of the lack of focus on our business
under our prior owners. Under Crown’s ownership, the business has mainly focused on volumes and cash generation to support
Crown’s other businesses, which presents a significant opportunity for margin improvement. From 2017 to 2020, Titan Group
represented approximately 20% of Crown’s sales but only 8% of its capital expenditures.

As a stand-alone business, we aim to reorient the business towards growth and margin improvement. Capitalizing on
the above strengths as a stand-alone business, we believe we have numerous levers to create additional value, grow volumes,
improve profitability and generate cash flows.

**_1. New Markets and Growth Opportunities_**

The Business has numerous growth opportunities arising from favorable consumption trends, such as a greater focus
on convenience, growth in single serve packaging, increasing premiumization and higher focus on sustainability. Operating as
a stand-alone entity, we will have greater flexibility to pursue opportunities that were not previously considered or prioritized
while integrated within the wider Crown business. In addition, we will have the benefit of a steady capital expenditure program


-----

that is focused on our business, allowing us to pursue multi-year growth projects which we were unable to pursue under prior
ownership. End-markets such as infant nutrition and wet petfood have volume growth opportunities at attractive margins that
we believe we can capture by employing our capabilities and expertise developed in other end-markets. Our metal cans are
well-positioned to benefit from these growth opportunities in light of their favorable barrier properties and the premium
perception and convenience that our products offer. In addition, we are focused on growing our share and penetration in key
emerging markets such as Eastern Europe and Africa, where our existing customers are establishing footprints that we can
readily support with existing technologies and know-how.

**_2. Procurement Optimization_**

Tinplate steel makes up for more than 80% of our raw materials spend and represented 48% of our cost of products
sold in the year ended December 31, 2020. We believe our market position enables us to optimize sourcing and pricing for our
tinplate steel purchases and provides further opportunities for margin expansion. While the Business under Crown’s ownership
mainly focused on ensuring stability of supply and favorable working capital arrangements, as a stand-alone business we will
have the opportunity to manage supply arrangements in support of better margins, including through utilizing a greater share
of raw materials from low cost countries. We have developed optimization initiatives to realize the most favorable pricing with
suppliers for the highest quality tinplate with the shortest supply chain lead times.

There is potential for additional cost savings opportunities in the form of reduced spend on logistics, raw material
specification complexity reductions, indirect cost savings and contract structure improvements. We believe there is an
opportunity to purchase higher volume of fewer SKUs, and also consolidate production of precursor products into fewer
facilities, thereby reducing the number of facilities receiving raw material shipments and to improve the structure of certain of
our contracts. In addition, we believe there are opportunities to optimize indirect and other materials procurement through
targeted sourcing initiatives. In the three months ended March 31, 2021, Titan Group already realized the benefit of improved
procurement practices and commercial efforts, leading to expanding margins for this period.

**_3. Manufacturing Optimization_**

We expect to realize further efficiencies by improving the asset utilization and productivity of our manufacturing
footprint. We intend to employ targeted capital expenditures focused on modernizing the equipment used at several of our key
facilities with a goal of increasing the capacity of those facilities and allowing more efficient and cost-effective production
while reducing the number of facilities in our network.

Our Business grew substantially following the acquisition of Mivisa in 2014, however, we did not fully integrate the
Mivisa and legacy manufacturing footprints and did not achieve the margin targets or synergies forecast at the time. We believe
that there are certain manufacturing function overlaps and duplications as a result of the acquisition and our organic growth.
We intend to replicate the “hub and spoke” operating model, used successfully by Mivisa, whereby certain functions that can
easily and cost-effectively be transported are completed at lower cost plants to improve and optimize asset utilization. For
example, we believe that the manufacturing of ends and certain upstream functions such as metal processing and coating can
be consolidated into facilities that specialize in production of those precursor products. Such products would then be transported
to existing can finishing or assembly plants that are located close to our customers and have a lean operating footprint. This
approach was successfully developed at Mivisa, which operated the largest ends production facility in the world in Murcia,
Spain, producing more than 9 billion ends annually and serviced nearly its entire network using this plant and also serviced a
significant export business of ends. We intend to replicate this model across the Group’s existing manufacturing footprint.

**_4. Commercial Excellence and Continuous Improvement Initiatives_**

In addition to revenue improvement and market share capture, our strategy also has a strong focus on delivering further
cost savings and unlocking further margin improvement potential. We plan to develop a continuous improvement culture and
invest in training across the entire business. KPS and Management have conducted a comprehensive and granular review of
our operating model. We believe that as a stand-alone business, we will be able to realize these cost savings and margin
expansions based on KPS’ proven track record in realising improvements in manufacturing businesses.

We have identified a number of commercial excellence and continuous improvement priorities, including (i) more
focused deployment of capital expenditures, (ii) quality management in the form of manufacturing and operational excellence
initiatives; (iii) maintenance and repair optimization, (iv) using a local sales force to improve engagement between our sales
and operations teams and (v) a focus on customer service, innovation and responsiveness initiatives. As a stand-alone business
focused on the manufacturing of food cans and ends, we will be more readily able to pursue these opportunities rather than
having to compete with the other capital priorities of our former owner.


-----

Our planned capital projects include investments focused on asset productivity, such as tooling upgrades to multi-die
presses and high speed printing and coating lines capable of delivering up to 300% improvements in productivity. Our planned
capital projects typically have a payback of approximately two to three years. We also believe there is an opportunity to improve
the effectiveness of our commercial function by streamlining our financial reporting structure, providing greater visibility to
our local sales teams and enabling them to optimize the margin profile of products they are selling. We believe our customers
derive significant value from our product offering and we intend to capture additional margin for the superior service and
capabilities that we offer.

                     - be a senior subordinated obligation of that Guarantor;

                     - be subordinated in right of payment to all of the Guarantors’
existing and future senior indebtedness, including any indebtedness
under or in respect of the Credit Facilities Agreement and certain
hedging obligations;

                     - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future
senior subordinated indebtedness and other liabilities of that
Guarantor that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to
the Guarantees;

                     - be effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured
Indebtedness and other obligations of such Guarantor that are
secured by assets that do not secure its Guarantee or that are secured
on a first-priority basis over assets that secure the Guarantees on a
second-priority basis (including the Indebtedness Incurred under
the Credit Facilities Agreement and certain Hedging Obligations),
to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness
or such other obligations, and to any creditor having a preferred
claim by operation of law, to the extent of the value of such
preferred claim;

                     - be structurally subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness
of subsidiaries of such Guarantor that do not Guarantee the Notes,
including obligations to trade creditors; and


-----

                     - be subject to the limitations described under “Limitations on
_Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

The Guarantees will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement and may be released in certain circumstances. See
“Description of the Notes—Guarantees”, and “Description of Certain
_Financing and Guarantee Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

**Security........................................................** On the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by the Escrow Charge. Upon
the definitive release of the Escrow Proceeds, the first-priority security
interests over the Escrow Proceeds will be released.

On or prior to the Completion Date, to the extent legally possible and
subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes will be secured by
(collectively, the “Collateral”):

                     - a first-ranking security interest in (1) a pledge of shares held in the
Issuer by Topco; (2) a pledge of the receivables in respect of certain
material intercompany loans owed to Topco, if any; and (3) a pledge
of material operating bank accounts of the Issuer; and

                     - a second-ranking security interest in (1) a pledge of shares held in
Bidco by the Issuer; and (2) a pledge of receivables in respect of
certain material intercompany loans owed to the Issuer by Bidco
(items 1 and 2 collectively, the “Shared Collateral”).

The Shared Collateral will also secure on a first-ranking basis the Credit
Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations and may also
secure certain future indebtedness. The security interests over the
Collateral may be released under certain circumstances. See
“Description of the Notes—Security; the Collateral.”

The security interests in the Collateral will be subject to the limitations
described under “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations.”_

**Additional Amounts ..................................** Any payments made by the Issuer or any Guarantor with respect to the
Notes will be made without withholding or deduction for or on account
of taxes unless required by law. If the Issuer or Guarantors are required
by law to withhold or deduct amounts for or on account of tax imposed
or levied by a relevant Tax Jurisdiction with respect to a payment to the
holders of the Notes, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will, subject to
certain exceptions, pay the additional amounts necessary so that the net
amount received by the holders of the Notes after the withholding or
deduction is not less than the amount that they would have received in
the absence of the withholding or deduction. See “Description of the
_Notes—Additional Amounts.”_

**Optional Redemption .................................** At any time prior to     , 2024, the Issuer may on any one or more
occasions redeem all or a part of the Notes at a redemption price equal
to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof redeemed, plus the
applicable “make-whole” premium (described in this Offering
Memorandum) and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts
if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.


-----

At any time prior to     , 2024, the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of
the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including
additional notes, if any) with the net cash proceeds from certain equity
offerings at a redemption price equal to      % of the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts if any,
to, but excluding, the redemption date provided that at least 50% of the
original aggregate principal amount of the Notes remains outstanding
immediately following the redemption.

At any time prior to    , 2024, the Issuer may, during each twelvemonth period commencing with the issue date, redeem up to 10% of the
original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including additional
notes, if any) at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount
of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

At any time on or after    , 2024, the Issuer will be entitled at its option
to redeem all or a portion of the Notes at the redemption prices set forth
under the caption “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption” and
Additional Amounts if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

**Optional Redemption for Tax Reasons...** In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the Issuer may
redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, at a redemption
price of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest
and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of
redemption. See “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption for
_Tax Reasons.”_

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory**
**Redemption ..................................................** Concurrently with the closing of the Offering on the Issue Date, the
Issuer will deposit the gross proceeds of the Offering into the Escrow
Account, to hold such amounts pending the consummation of the
Acquisition. The Escrow Account will be in the name of the Issuer and
will be controlled by the Escrow Agent and pledged on a first-ranking
basis to the Trustee for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks related to the Notes—If the Acquisition is not completed,_
_you may not obtain the return that you expect on the Notes,”_

The release of the funds credited to the Escrow Account and the
consummation of the Acquisition will be subject to the satisfaction of
certain conditions. Upon delivery to the Escrow Agent of an officer’s
certificate stating that the conditions to the release of the Escrow
Proceeds have been met or will be satisfied promptly following the
release of the Escrow Proceeds, the Escrow Proceeds will be released to
the Issuer and utilized as described in “Use of Proceeds” and
“Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
_Redemption” and the Escrow Charge will be released._

In the event that the Completion Date does not take place on or prior to
the Escrow Longstop Date, the Issuer will redeem the Notes at a price
equal to 100% of the aggregate initial issue price of the Notes, plus
accrued but unpaid interest from the Issue Date to, but not including the
Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined herein) (subject to the
right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest
due on the relevant interest payment date). See “Risk Factors—Risks


-----

_related to the Notes—If the Acquisition is not completed, you may not_
_obtain the return that you expect on the Notes,” and “Description of the_
_Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”_

In the event that the special mandatory redemption price payable upon a
special mandatory redemption exceeds the Escrow Proceeds, the
Sponsor will, pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter, be required to
make an equity contribution to the Issuer to pay any funding shortfall to
cover the accrued and unpaid interest, and Additional Amounts, if any,
owing to the holders of the Notes and any negative interest charged on
the Escrow Account. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Escrow of
_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.’’_

**Change of Control .....................................** Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control,
the Issuer may be required to offer to repurchase the Notes at a purchase
price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date
of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if
any, to the date of repurchase. A change of control will not be deemed to
have occurred if a certain consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded
as a result of such event. See “Description of the Notes—Change of
_Control.”_

In connection with a change of control offer for the Notes, if holders of
not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes
validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such change of control
offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a change of control
offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and
not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer, or any third party making such
a change of control offer in lieu of the Issuer, will have the right, upon
prior notice to the holders, to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding
following such purchase at a price equal to the price paid to each other
holder of Notes in such change of control offer, plus, to the extent not
included in the change of control offer payment, accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but not including,
the redemption date.

**Certain Covenants ......................................** The Indenture contains covenants that limit the ability of the Issuer and
its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things:

                     - incur or guarantee additional debt and issue certain preferred stock;

                     - pay dividends or make other distributions or investments or
purchase or reduce or redeem the Issuer’s stock;

                     - make investments or other restricted payments;

                     - enter into agreements that restrict the Issuer’s restricted
subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends;

                     - transfer or sell assets;

                     - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

                     - create liens on assets to secure indebtedness;

                     - impair security interests; or

                     - merge or consolidate with other entities or transfer all or
substantially all of the Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s assets.


-----

Each of these covenants is subject to significant exceptions and
qualifications. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants.”
Certain of the covenants will be suspended if and for as long as the Group
achieves investment grade ratings. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—
_Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of_
_Investment Grade Status.’’_

**Intercreditor Agreement ...........................** Each holder of a Note by accepting a Note will be deemed to have agreed
to, and be bound by, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. The
Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, and
the rights and benefits of the holders of the Notes will be limited
accordingly and subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.
“Description of Certain Financing and Guarantee Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement.”_

**Use of Proceeds...........................................** The Issuer will use the gross proceeds of the Notes as set forth in “Use
_of Proceeds.”_

**Transfer Restrictions.................................** The Issuer has not registered the Notes or the Guarantees under the
Securities Act or the securities laws of any state of the United States or
any other jurisdiction and has not agreed, or otherwise undertaken, to do
so. You may only offer or sell Notes pursuant to an exemption from, or
in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of
the Securities Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Absence of a Public Market for the**
**Notes ............................................................** The Notes will be new securities for which there is no established trading
market. Although the Initial Purchasers have advised the Issuer that they
intend to make a market in the Notes, they are not obligated to do so and
they may discontinue market-making at any time without notice.
Accordingly, the Issuer cannot assure you as to the development or
liquidity of any market for the Notes. Furthermore, the Notes will not
have registration rights under the US Securities Act.

**Listing ..........................................................** Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority
Limited (the ‘‘Authority’’) for the listing of the Notes on the Official
List of The International Stock Exchange (the ‘‘Exchange’’) and

**SUMMARY FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

_The Issuer is a holding company formed for the purpose of facilitating the Acquisition and is not expected to engage in any_
_activities other than those related to the Acquisition. We do not present in this Offering Memorandum any financial information_
_or financial statements of the Issuer._

_The following tables present summary combined historical financial information and other data as of and for each of the years_
_ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021 and the last twelve months ended_
_March 31, 2021 for the Titan Group, which have been derived from the Audited Combined Financial Statements and the_
_Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements._

_The Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements present,_
_on a historical cost basis, the combined assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses related to the Business constituting the Titan_
_Group. Throughout the periods covered by the Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Condensed_
_Combined Interim Financial Statements, the Titan Group, operated as a part of Crown. Consequently, stand-alone financial_
_statements have not been historically prepared for the Titan Group. The Audited Combined Financial Statements and the_
_Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements have been derived from Crown’s historical accounting records_
_and as if the Titan Group operated on a stand-alone basis. The Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited_
_Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements include the historical operations, assets and liabilities of the legal entities_
_and components of legal entities that are considered to comprise Titan Group’s Business._ _The Combined Statement of_
_Operations include all revenues and costs directly attributable to Titan Group, including costs for facilities, functions and_
_services used by the Titan Group._ _Crown uses a centralized approach to cash management and financing most of its operations._
_Accordingly, the cash and cash equivalents included on the Combined Balance Sheets represents cash balances specifically_
_attributable to the Titan Group at the end of each reporting period._ _The allocations and estimates in the Audited Combined_
_Financial Statements and the Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements are based on assumptions that_
_Management believes are reasonable._

_The assets, liabilities, income and expenses that Management have determined relate to the Titan Group include all those that_
_are directly attributable and/or separately identifiable to the Titan Group, together with an allocation of items that are not._
_Certain estimates, judgments and assumptions have been made for the purpose of allocating items to the Audited Combined_
_Financial Statements and the Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements that are not directly attributable_
_and/or separately identifiable._

_The Audited Combined Financial Statements and Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements do not_
_necessarily reflect the Titan Group’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows had the Titan Group been a separate_
_entity, or the future results of the Titan Group as it will exist upon the completion of the Acquisition._

_We also present in the tables below certain summary pro forma data of the Titan Group. Such summary pro forma data is_
_presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what our combined income statement and balance_
_sheet would have been if the Transactions had occurred on the dates indicated and is not intended to project our combined_
_results of operations or combined financial position for any future period or date._

_The following tables should be read in conjunction with the Audited Combined Financial Statements and Unaudited Condensed_
_Combined Interim Financial Statements, including the notes thereto, which are included elsewhere in this Offering_
_Memorandum. See also “Presentation of Financial and Other Information,” “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and_
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Capitalization.”_

(1) We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental measures of our operating performance. EBITDA
represents operating income/(loss) plus depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as adjusted for certain non-operating
and non-recurring items as set forth below. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA on a pro forma basis for estimated procurement
savings. We believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information as supplemental measures of
performance and liquidity. We note, however, that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, may not be
comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our operating
results as reported under U.S. GAAP and have limitations as analytical tools. Some of these limitations include the following: (i) they do not reflect
capital expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (ii) they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements
for, working capital needs; (iii) they do not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on
debt; and (iv) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced
in the future and do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements. See “ Presentation of Financial and Other
_Information – Alternative performance measures (“APMs”)” and “ Risk Factors –Risks Relating to the Acquisition – Titan Group’s ability to operate_
_its business effectively may suffer if it is unable to cost-effectively establish its own administrative and other support functions in order to operate as a_
_standalone company after the expiration of the Transitional Services Agreement with the Crown Group.”_

The calculations for Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA are based on various assumptions, management estimates and unaudited
management accounts. These amounts have not been audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm. This information is inherently
subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or results of operations of the transactions
for the periods presented and may not be comparable to our combined financial statements or other financial information included in this Offering
Memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA because we believe they are helpful to investors as measures of our operating performance and ability to service our debt.

**317**

(a) This amount represents that portion of the historical costs and expenses of Crown assigned to Titan Group in the Audited Combined Financial
Statements and Unaudited Interim Condensed Combined Financial Statements using an allocation method primarily based on percentage of
sales, including expenses for executive management, finance, legal, information technology, employee benefit administration, treasury and risk
management as well as technology royalties.

(b) This amount represents the costs and expenses required to operate the Group on a standalone basis. These costs cover substantially the same
categories that comprise the amounts under “ Discontinued Corporate Allocations”. Standalone costs are expected to be significantly less than
costs incurred under the Discontinued Corporate Allocations. See “ Risk Factors — Risks Relating to the Acquisition — Titan Group’s ability to
_operate its business effectively may suffer if it is unable to cost-effectively establish its own administrative and other support functions in order_
_to operate as a standalone company after the expiration of the Transitional Services Agreement with the Crown Group.” Standalone costs are_
based on management estimates and assumptions (including the successful implementation of our standalone strategy) and are forward looking
in nature. As such, this information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in our estimates. Any failure by us to successfully execute on our standalone strategy could materially impact our results. As such,
this information is inherently subject to business, economic and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those contained in our estimated standalone costs and expenses. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial impact or
results of these actions and initiatives and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. If one or more of our underlying
assumptions proves to have been incorrect, this could lead to substantially higher costs than planned and we may not be able to realize fully, or
realize in the anticipated time frame, the estimated benefits from our standalone cost-savings. See "Risk Factors — Risks Relating to the
_Acquisition — Titan Group has no operating history as a standalone company and it may not be successful in implementing its strategy as a_
_standalone business."_

(c) Following the Completion Date, the Business will operate on a stand-alone basis independently of its United States parent. Given that none of
the Group’s operations are in the United States, we expect that our reporting currency will shift from the U.S. Dollar to the Euro and we anticipate
preparing our financial statements under IFRS. The amounts in this line item represent the estimated impact of operating lease expenses
recognized under IFRS 16, which introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees. The amounts in this line item represent
the U.S. GAAP operating lease expense from the Audited Combined Financial Statements as a proxy for the IFRS 16 lease liabilities. See Annex
A for a discussion of certain differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. A lessee recognizes a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the
underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligations to make lease payments. There are optional exemptions for short-term leases
and leases of low value items.

(d) This adjustment in the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily relates to a $25 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge, incurred related
primarily to our aerosols and promotional packaging activities, resulting from the outlook for tinplate aerosol packaging having declined and
operating costs in the aerosol and promotional packaging activities having increased, as well as an $8 million restructuring add-back and a $3
million loss on disposal. The adjustment in the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily relates to a $2 million gain on disposal. The Business
has undergone a variety of restructuring efforts, primarily related to plant closures in France and Germany in an effort to reduce overall fixed
headcount and duplicative positions. Restructuring costs included in this adjustment take account of severance and other general cost associated
with implementing the restructuring such as cleaning or stripping plants.

(e) Represents the removal of non-operating costs included in pension expense, in particular amortization of prior year unrealized losses related to

The Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Condensed Combined Financial Statements included
in this Offering Memorandum are based on U.S. GAAP, which differs in certain respects from IFRS. For a discussion of certain
significant differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS, see Annex A. Management has undertaken a preliminary analysis to
assess the potential impact on the Group’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows from a change from U.S.
GAAP to IFRS. Management has determined that the application of IFRS 16 is expected to impact the Group's treatment of
leases, in particular with respect to the income statement. For the estimated impact of the application of IFRS 16 on the Group's
Adjusted EBITDA, see “Summary Financial and Other Information.” While Management believes that the application of IFRS
16 will be the main impact to the Group’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows as a result of the change from
U.S. GAAP to IFRS, the Group has not prepared and is not presenting a reconciliation of the Audited Combined Financial
Statements and the Unaudited Interim Combined Consolidated Financial Statements to IFRS in this Offering Memorandum,
and it is possible that such a change could lead to other differences to the Group’s financial position, results of operations and
cash flows from the amounts presented in this Offering Memorandum. See “Risk Factors – The Financial Statements are based
_on U.S. GAAP and there may be differences between our financial position and results of operations prepared in accordance_
_with U.S. GAAP and IFRS. In addition, should Titan Group decide to adopt IFRS as its accounting reporting method, this could_
_potentially result in material changes to certain of its financial information from the information presented in this Offering_
_Memorandum.”_


-----

Following the Completion Date, the Business will no longer be part of the Crown Group and hence will be operated
independently from its United States parent. Given that none of the Group’s operations are in the United States, we expect that
our reporting currency will shift from the U.S. Dollar to the Euro, representing the functional currency in a majority of the
jurisdictions in which we operate. Therefore, we have included below a convenience translation into the Euro, based on the
exchange rates derived from Titan Group’s accounting systems or, in the case of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, the average
exchange rate for the twelve months period ended March 31, 2021 based on market observable rates, of the summary financial
data included above which is presented for illustrative purposes only. Footnotes to the tables have not been repeated or
separately translated into Euro. See “Presentation of Financial Information – Convenience Translation”.

**RISK FACTORS**

_This Offering involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below as well as other_
_information and data contained in this Offering Memorandum before making an investment decision. If any of the events_
_described in the risk factors below occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially_
_adversely affected, which in turn could materially adversely affect our ability to repay the Notes. The risks described below are_
_not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be_
_immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or prospects. In any such_
_case, you may lose all or part of your investment in the Notes._

_This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual_
_results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including_
_the risks described below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

Risks Relating to Titan Group's Business and Industry

**_Titan Group's business is seasonal and adverse weather conditions could reduce Titan Group's net sales._**

Titan Group manufactures metal packaging primarily for food products. At least 45% of the Group’s revenue is
generated from sales to seasonal food end-markets. These sales can be affected by weather conditions as well as seasonal
availability of the food products. For example, sales are typically greater in the second and third quarters of the year, with
generally lower sales in the first and fourth quarters. Despite the minimum volume clauses in certain of Titan Group’s contracts,
poor weather conditions that reduce crop yields of certain food types, could lead to decrease in customer demand for Titan
Group’s food packaging products (and climate change could increase the frequency of adverse weather extremes). In addition,
demand for Titan Group’s seafood packaging could be affected by variations in the volume of local fish catches. The inherent
volatility of food and seafood production businesses as well as Titan Group’s exposure to fluctuating weather conditions could
have a material adverse effect on Titan Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Titan Group is subject to the risks associated with maintaining and operating its manufacturing facilities._**

Titan Group is subject to the risks associated with operating, and must incur potentially significant capital and other
expenditures necessary to maintain, its manufacturing facilities, machinery and equipment. Titan Group must maintain its
manufacturing facilities in order to, among other things, keep up with demand for its products, retain sufficient capacity to
manufacture new products and increase its margins. If Titan Group is unable to maintain sufficient manufacturing capacity to
keep up with demand for its products and ensure that its sales and production teams adequately coordinate their planning and
production efforts, Titan Group risks losing potential product sales.

Titan Group’s operations use manufacturing processes, which are conducted at high speeds and involve operating
heavy machinery and equipment, such as cutting, coating and shaping metal into containers. These processes entail various
operational, industrial and environmental risks and hazards, including industrial accidents, leaks and ruptures, explosions, fires,
adverse weather conditions, natural disasters such as floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, ice storms and earthquakes, supply
interruptions, human error, terrorist acts, power outages, mechanical failures and environmental hazards, such as spills, storage
tank leaks, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances and gases. These hazards may cause unplanned business
interruptions, unscheduled downtime, transportation interruptions, personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or the
destruction of property and equipment, environmental contamination and other environmental damage, civil, criminal and
administrative sanctions and liabilities, and third-party claims, any of which may have a material adverse effect on Titan
Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, in June 2020, the roof of a storage building at our
site in Laon, France suffered a partial collapse, with reconstruction to be envisioned to begin in 2021. Crown has agreed to
reimburse Titan Group for certain losses suffered in connection with this roof collapse pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement.
The operation of manufacturing facilities also requires Titan Group to hire, train and evaluate large numbers of production
employees, which involves additional labor and employment related risks and uncertainties.

Unscheduled shutdowns may also occur due to technical failure or other reasons. Extended downtime at any of Titan
Group’s major operating facilities, whether the result of a scheduled shutdown or otherwise, could reduce rates of asset
utilization and undermine Titan Group’s ability to maintain high production volumes, which could materially adversely affect
Titan Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.


-----

As part of the Acquisition, Crown will continue to own and operate the Braunstone site and sell its food cans to Titan
Group at cost during a two to three year transition period. If these arrangements are not implemented as expected or if, once
implemented, they have an unexpected impact on Titan Group’s manufacturing capability, its business, financial condition and
results of operations could be adversely impacted.

**_Titan Group may be affected by manufacturing defects or product liability or recall claims or may otherwise be_**
**_subject to adverse publicity._**

The success of our business depends on the quality and reliability of our products and our customer relations. In the
event that our products materially fail to satisfy our customers’ requirements, our reputation and sales volumes could suffer.
Titan Group may be required to manufacture replacement products at its own expense if they fail to meet its customers’
standards, expectations and/or the applicable health and safety standards of the country in which a product is distributed, and
Titan Group may be subject to product liability claims in connection with the foregoing. We may incur significant expenditures
as a result of product recalls, market withdrawals or other product liability or product-related claims. We may also suffer other
commercial and financial consequences in connection with manufacturing defects or product liability claims, including fines
and payments to customers, their contractors or distributors in respect of destroyed inventory, out of stock penalties and
consumer complaints.

Although Titan Group has control measures and systems in place in an effort to ensure the maximum safety and quality
of its products is maintained, the consequences of not being able to do so, due to accidental or malicious raw material or product
contamination, or due to supply chain contamination caused by human error or faulty equipment, could be severe. Such
consequences may include adverse effects on consumer health, reputation, loss of customers and market share, financial costs
or loss of revenue. If any of its products are found to be defective, Titan Group could be required to recall such products, which
could result in adverse publicity, significant expenses and a disruption in sales and could affect its reputation and that of its
products. Although Titan Group maintains product liability and recall insurance coverage, potential product liability or recall
claims may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or such claims may be excluded under the terms of the applicable policy.
In addition, if any of our competitors or customers supply faulty or contaminated products to the market, or if manufacturers
of the end-products that utilize our products produce faulty or contaminated products, our industry, or our end-products’
industries, could be negatively impacted, which could have adverse effects on our business.

In certain contracts, Titan Group provides warranties in respect of the proper functioning of its products and the
conformity of a product to the specific use defined by the customer. In addition, if one of our customer’s products contained in
packaging manufactured by us is faulty or contaminated, it is possible that the manufacturer of the product may allege that our
packaging is the cause of the fault or contamination, even if the packaging complies with contractual specifications.

In case of the failure of packaging produced by Titan Group to open properly or to preserve the integrity of its contents,
Titan Group could face liability to its customers and to third parties for bodily injury or other tangible or intangible damages
suffered as a result. Such liability, if it were to be established in relation to a sufficient volume of claims or to claims for
sufficiently large amounts, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Any manufacturing defects or product liability claims against us could subject us to adverse publicity. In addition,
Titan Group may be subject to adverse publicity relating to other matters, including, but not limited to, product quality, brand
image, complaints, environmental impact, human rights practices, production facilities and employee relationships. The
widespread use of social media and networking sites by consumers has greatly increased the speed and accessibility of
information dissemination. Adverse publicity may negatively impact our reputation, regardless of whether the allegations are
valid. The negative impact of adverse publicity relating to any of our products, brands or production facilities may extend far
beyond the product, brand or plant involved to affect some or all of our other products, brands and facilities. Any such adverse
publicity may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Although we have not had material claims for damages for defective products in the past, and have not conducted any
substantial product recalls or other material correct action, these events may occur in the future. We utilize quality control and
assurance systems in all of our plants, and maintain general and third-party liability insurance, product liability insurance, and
other insurance coverages Titan Group deems appropriate. When Titan Group receives complaints from customers, it conducts
a technical root cause analysis to determine the reason for the complaint and Titan Group implements steps to prevent a
reoccurrence. We can provide no assurance, however, that such measures will ensure that our products meet our customers’
standards or that such insurance will be adequate to cover all potential claims. See “Business—Properties.”

**_Titan Group's principal markets may be subject to overcapacity and price competition from other metal packaging_**
**_producers, which could reduce Titan Group's net sales and net income._**

Titan Group operates in the food metal packaging sector which is highly competitive and, in recent years (disregarding
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic which temporarily increased demand for canned foods for at home use), increasingly
characterized by limited growth in demand. Food cans are standardized products, allowing for relatively little differentiation
among competitors. The most competitive aspect of the metal packaging market is the sale of undifferentiated, standardized
food cans. Prices for these products are primarily driven by raw material costs and seasonal capacity. Our principal competitors
include Massilly, Silgan Holdings, Trivium, Auxiliar, DomIberia, Glud Marstrand and Sarten. If capacity growth outpaced the
growth in demand for food cans, this could lead to additional overcapacity and heightened price competition among food can
producers. These could significantly reduce demand for Titan Group’s products or force Titan Group to lower its prices, which,
in turn, could lead to decline in revenue and net income, negatively impacting Titan Group’s margins and increasing its debt
balances. Competitive pricing pressures and overcapacity combined with the failure to develop new product designs and
technologies for products, as well as other factors, such as consolidation among Titan Group's competitors, could cause Titan
Group to lose existing business or opportunities to generate new business and could result in decreased cash flow and net
income, which could have material adverse effect on Titan Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Intense competition from manufacturers of alternative forms of food packaging products could lead to decreased_**
**_demand in Titan Group’s products resulting in lower profits and reduced cash flows._**

Titan Group is subject to substantial competition from producers of alternative packaging made from glass, paper,
flexible materials and plastic. Changes in preferences for products and packaging by consumers of prepackaged food products
could lead to increase in consumer demand for alternative food products packaging. Titan Group's sales depend heavily on the
volumes of sales by Titan Group's customers in the food markets. Changes in packaging by Titan Group's customers may
require Titan Group to re-tool manufacturing operations, which could require material expenditures. Decreases in the costs of
alternative packaging could negatively affect Titan Group’s sales, resulting in lower profits and reduced cash flows for Titan
Group. For example, increases in the price of aluminum and steel and decreases in the price of plastic resin, which is a
petrochemical product and may fluctuate with prices in the oil and gas market, may increase substitution of plastic food
containers for metal containers or increases in the price of steel may increase substitution of aluminum packaging for aerosol
products.

Failure by Titan Group to successfully compete against alternative packaging products producers could results in
decreased demand for its products, which combined with low capacity utilization rates in its operations, could have material
adverse effect on Titan Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Titan Group's business results depend on its ability to understand its customers' specific preferences and_**
**_requirements based on changing consumer preferences or otherwise, and to develop, manufacture and market products that_**
**_meet customer demand._**

The food packaging industry is greatly affected by evolving customer tastes, preferences, perception and spending
patterns. The popularity of certain food product types for which Titan Group currently supplies packaging, such as fresh or
frozen food content and dry versus wet pet food, may decline in the future due to consumers’ changing lifestyle, nutrition,
health or taxation considerations. In the past, the occurrence of diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy and swine
fever have sometimes led to reduced demand for associated canned products, such as sauces, soups and ready meals, and
publicity about the supposed carcinogenic effect of coatings used on some cans may have affected sales of some canned
products. Any decline in the popularity of any of Titan Group’s customers’ product types as a result of lifestyle, nutrition, health
considerations or consumer taxation could have a significant impact on Titan Group’s customers and could have a material
adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Titan Group's ability to develop new packaging product offerings for a diverse group of international customers with
differing preferences and changing tastes, while maintaining functionality and spurring innovation, is critical to its success.
This requires a thorough understanding of Titan Group's existing and potential customers on an international basis, particularly
in potential high developing markets. The Group must also introduce new products and services to meet changing customer
demands and needs. If Titan Group is unable to regularly implement better production processes or to develop new products
through R&D efforts or licensing of new technology, it may not be able to remain competitive with other manufacturers. Failure
to deliver quality products that meet customer needs ahead of competitors could have a significant adverse effect on Titan
Group's business, financial condition and results of operations.


-----

**_The loss of a major customer and/or customer consolidation could reduce Titan Group's net sales and profitability._**

Titan Group sells its products to a stable base of over 1,000 customers, including several food market leaders. Titan
Group believes that its relationships with its customers are good, but there can be no assurance that Titan Group will be able to
maintain these relationships and that the customers will continue to purchase Titan Group’s products. Although no one customer
accounted for more than 8% of its net sales in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018, the loss of any major
customers, a reduction in the purchasing levels of these customers or an adverse change in the terms of supply agreements with
these customers could reduce Titan Group's net sales and net income and have material adverse effect on Titan Group’s
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Based on Management estimates, the vast majority of sales are covered by at least annual contracts, with up to 40%
of total sales secured on multi-year contracts. Although these arrangements have provided, and Titan Group expects they will
continue to provide, the basis for long-term partnerships with its customers, there can be no assurance that Titan Group’s
customers will not cease purchasing its products due to a switch to one of its competitors, in-sourcing of manufacturing or
otherwise, or that they will not push for more aggressive terms upon contract renewals with Titan Group.

Many of Titan Group's largest customers have acquired companies with similar or complementary product lines. This
consolidation has increased the concentration of Titan Group's business with its largest customers. In many cases, such
consolidation has been accompanied by pressure from customers for lower prices, reflecting the increase in the total volume of
product purchased or the elimination of a price differential between the acquiring customer and the company acquired.
Increased pricing pressures from Titan Group's customers may reduce Titan Group's net sales and net income. The consolidation
of Titan Group’s customers may also lead customers to rely on a reduced number of suppliers of food packaging products, with
a competitor becoming the main supplier to the consolidated companies, which could have material adverse effect on Titan
Group’s business, financial condition or results of operations.

**_Titan Group's financial results could be materially adversely affected if Titan Group is not able to secure sufficient_**
**_quantities of raw materials or if the price of raw materials or energy rises and Titan Group cannot increase the price of its_**
**_products._**

Titan Group uses various raw materials, such as tinplate steel, aluminum, natural gas, electricity as well as materials
derived from crude oil such as lacquer and ink, in its manufacturing operations. Sufficient quantities of these raw materials
may not be available in the future or may be available only at increased prices. The availability of these raw materials and their
prices depends on global and local supply and demand forces, governmental regulations (such as the EU’s Regulation (EU)
2019/159 imposing definitive safeguard measures against imports of certain steel products, including 25% tariff duty if trade
flows exceed certain set levels), level of production, resource availability, industrial actions or strikes by employees of suppliers,
transportation, and other factors, including natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes. In particular, in recent years the
consolidation of steel and aluminum suppliers, shortage of raw materials affecting the production of steel and aluminum and
the increased global demand for these materials, including in China and other developing countries, have contributed to an
overall tighter supply, resulting in increased steel and aluminum prices and, in some cases, special surcharges and allocated cut
backs of products by steel and aluminum suppliers.

If Titan Group is unable to obtain adequate supplies of tinplate, steel, aluminum, resins or other raw materials for a
significant period of time, Titan Group's operations would be disrupted and any such disruption may materially adversely affect
Titan Group's business, financial condition or results of operations.

Titan Group's raw material supply contracts vary as to terms and duration, with tinplate negotiated on an annual basis
with substantially all of supply based on fixed annual pricing, with the small remainder on a spot pricing basis and aluminum
contracts typically multi-year in duration with fluctuating prices based on aluminum prices. The prices of certain raw materials
used by Titan Group, such as tinplate steel, aluminum, resins and processed energy, have historically been subject to volatility.
In the year ended December 31, 2020, tinplate steel represented more than 80% of Titan Group's raw material spend. While
some, but not all, of Titan Group's contracts pass through raw material costs to customers, and Titan Group sets the prices of
its products taking into account the largely fixed annual price for tinplate steel, Titan Group may be unable to increase its prices
to offset increases in raw material costs without suffering reductions in unit volume, revenue and operating income. In addition,
any price increases may take effect after related cost increases, reducing operating income in the near term. Future tinplate steel
supply contracts may also provide for prices that fluctuate or adjust rather than provide a fixed price during a one-year period.
There can be no assurance that, in the future, Titan Group will be able to secure adequate supplies of raw materials from its
current suppliers or other sources on terms as favorable as its current terms, or at all. Moreover, as a result of continuing global
supply and demand pressures, other commodity-related costs affecting Titan Group's business may increase as well, including
natural gas, electricity and freight-related costs. If the future prices of these raw material increase and Titan Group is unable


-----

to offset such increases, Titan Group's operations would be disrupted and any such disruption may materially adversely affect
Titan Group's business, financial condition or results of operations.

Moreover, significant increases in raw material costs may increase Titan Group's working capital requirements, which
may increase Titan Group's average outstanding indebtedness and interest expense and may exceed the amounts available under
Titan Group's credit facilities and other sources of liquidity. In addition, Titan Group hedges raw material costs on behalf of
certain customers and may suffer losses if such customers are unable to satisfy their purchase obligations. This could lead to
liquidity constraints and could, if Titan Group is unable to procure sufficient working capital to cover heightened capital needs,
material adversely Titan Group's financial results.

**_The loss of third-party transportation providers upon whom Titan Group depends or increases in fuel prices could_**
**_increase Titan Group's costs or cause a disruption in Titan Group's operations._**

Titan Group depends generally upon third-party transportation providers for delivery of raw materials to its
manufacturing facilities and delivery of its products to customers. Strikes, slowdowns, transportation disruptions or other
conditions in the transportation industry, including, but not limited to, shortages of truck drivers, disruptions in rail service,
decreases in the availability of vessels or increases in fuel prices, could increase Titan Group's costs and disrupt Company’s
operations and its ability to receive raw materials and service customers on a timely basis.

**_If Titan Group fails to retain key management and personnel, Titan Group may be unable to implement its business_**
**_plan._**

The success of Titan Group’s business strategy depends on its ability to attract, train, retain and motivate skilled
managerial, technical, sales, administration, development and operating personnel. Members of Titan Group's senior
management have extensive industry experience, and it might be difficult to find new personnel with comparable experience.
Because Titan Group's business is highly specialized, Titan Group believes that it would also be difficult to replace its key
technical personnel. Titan Group believes that its future success depends, in large part, on its experienced senior management
team. Losing the services of key members of its management or technical team could limit Titan Group's ability to implement
its business plan.

**_A significant portion of Titan Group's workforce is unionized and labor disruptions, along with other factors_**
**_affecting labor costs, could increase Titan Group's total costs or prevent Titan Group from supplying its customers._**

Titan Group has in the past, and may in the future, experience labor disputes and work stoppages at one or more of its
manufacturing sites due to localized strikes or strikes in the larger retail food industry sector. A significant portion of Titan
Group's workforce is unionized and a prolonged work stoppage or strike at any facility with unionized employees could increase
its costs and prevent Titan Group from supplying its customers. In addition, upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining
agreements, Titan Group may not reach new agreements without union action in certain jurisdictions and any such new
agreements may not be on terms satisfactory to Titan Group. If Titan Group is unable to negotiate acceptable collective
bargaining agreements, it may become subject to union-initiated work stoppages, including strikes. Moreover, additional groups
of currently non-unionized employees may seek union representation in the future.

An increase in labor costs could adversely affect Titan Group's profitability. Most of the factors affecting labor costs
are beyond Titan Group's control and Titan Group may not be able to adjust its pricing to reflect an increase in labor costs. A
shortage of qualified employees, general inflationary pressure on wages or an increase in national minimum wages or industry
or union agreed wages in any of the jurisdictions in which Titan Group operates could increase its labor costs and have a
material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We face costs associated with our post-retirement and post-employment obligations to employees which could have_**
**_an adverse effect on our financial condition._**

As of March 31, 2021, on a pro forma basis, our accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation was approximately
$91.9 million. The additional costs associated with these and other benefits to employees could have a material adverse effect
on our financial condition. In addition, in certain jurisdictions, these obligations may rank senior to the Guarantees in a
bankruptcy of the relevant Guarantor as a matter of law.

We operate a number of pension and other post-retirement benefit schemes funded by a range of assets which may
include property, derivatives, equities and/or bonds. The value of these assets is heavily dependent on the performance of
markets which are subject to volatility. The liability structure of the obligations to provide such benefits is also subject to market


-----

volatility in relation to its accounting valuation and management. Additional significant funding of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations may be required if market underperformance is severe.

**_Titan Group is subject to an investigation by the European Commission relating to potential anti-competitive_**
**_behavior and the outcome of this investigation or future investigations could materially adversely affect Titan Group’s_**
**_business, financial condition and results of operations._**

In March 2015, the Bundeskartellamt, or German Federal Cartel Office (“FCO”), conducted unannounced inspections
of the premises of several metal packaging manufacturers, including one of Titan Group’s German subsidiaries. The local court
order authorizing the inspection cited FCO suspicions of anti-competitive agreements in the market for the supply of metal
packaging products. Titan Group conducted an internal investigation into the matter and discovered instances of inappropriate
conduct by certain employees of German subsidiaries of Titan Group. Titan Group cooperated with the FCO and submitted, in
September and October 2015, a leniency application with the FCO which disclosed the findings of its internal investigation to
date. In April 2018, the FCO discontinued its national investigation and referred the matter to the European Commission (the
“Commission”). Following the referral, Commission officials conducted unannounced inspections of the premises of several
metal packaging manufacturers, including Titan Group’s subsidiaries in Germany, France and the United Kingdom.

The Commission’s investigation is ongoing and, to date, the Commission has not officially charged Titan Group or
any of its subsidiaries with violations of competition law. Titan Group is cooperating with the Commission and submitted a
leniency application in April 2018. This application may lead to the reduction of possible future penalties. At this stage of the
investigation Titan Group believes that a loss is probable but is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the Commission’s
investigation and is unable to estimate the loss or possible range of losses that could be incurred, and has therefore not recorded
a charge in connection with the actions by the Commission. If the Commission finds that Titan Group or any of its subsidiaries
violated competition law, fines levied by the Commission as well as third party damage claims by private enforcement, class
action or individual claims and any related costs and damages could be material to Titan Group’s operating results and cash
flows for the periods in which they are resolved or become reasonably estimable. In the Acquisition Agreement, Crown has
agreed to indemnify us for certain losses in connection with this investigation. See “The Business––Legal Proceedings.”

Finally, any attempt to expand production may attract additional scrutiny of European and other competition and antitrust regulators, and such an attempt may not succeed. In addition, Titan Group's size and prominence in the tinplate packaging
market may prompt heightened scrutiny by such regulators seeking to restrain anti-competitive market practices. Any additional
competition or anti-trust investigations could require significant legal expenditures and result in liabilities or adverse
governmental orders. Such developments could adversely affect Titan Group's business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_Titan Group has received questionnaires as part of an investigation of the French Competition Authority relating_**
**_to potential anticompetitive behavior with respect to the switch to bisphenol-A free cans in France and this investigation_**
**_could materially and adversely affect Titan Group's business, financial conditions and results of operations._**

In March 2018, the French Competition Authority started a preliminary investigation regarding possible
infringements to French competition law with respect to the switch to bisphenol-A free cans in France which implemented
legislation restricting the use of bisphenol-A in all recipients as of 1 January 2015. The French Syndicat National des Fabricants
_de Boîtes, a trade association representing food can suppliers in France of which Titan Group is a member, received a_
questionnaire from the French Competition Authority asking for information regarding the trade association’s activities in
relation to the development of BPA-NI cans. The French Competition Authority opened formal proceedings regarding possible
infringements of competition law in relation to the switch to bisphenol-free cans in France in September 2019. In the context
of the formal proceedings, the French Competition Authority sent, in January and February 2020, two questionnaires to Titan
Group relating to its activities, internal organization and identification of its different entities and their respective turnovers. In
January 2021, Titan Group received a request from the French Competition Authority asking for the permission to declassify
documents previously provided by Titan Group in response to the questionnaires received and Titan Group gave the French
Competition Authority the permission to do so.

The French Competition Authority's investigation is ongoing and, to date, Titan Group has not received any further
requests nor questionnaires from the French Competition Authority. At this stage of the investigation, Titan Group is unable to
predict the ultimate outcome of the French Competition Authority's investigation and is unable to estimate the loss that it could
incur. Should the Board of the French Competition Authority find that Titan Group or any of its subsidiary violated French
competition law, the fine levied by the French Competition Authority (the amount of which is determined on a case-by-case
basis depending notably on the seriousness of the infringement as well as its duration, but capped at 10% of the worldwide
turnover of the undertaking) could be material to Titan's Group's operating results and cash flows for the periods in which they


-----

are resolved or become reasonably estimable, as well as third party damage claims by private enforcement. In the Acquisition
Agreement, Crown has agreed to indemnify Titan Group for certain losses in connection with this investigation.

**_Titan Group is subject to costs and liabilities related to stringent environmental and health and safety standards._**

Laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and health and safety may increase Titan Group’s
operational costs and reduce its profitability. Titan Group's operations are subject to European, U.K. and other laws and
regulations governing the protection of the environment, including those relating to operating permits, treatment, storage and
disposal of waste, the use of chemicals, including regulated materials, in Titan Group's products and manufacturing process,
water supply and use, and discharges into water, emissions into the atmosphere, remediation of soil and groundwater
contamination, noise pollution, asbestos and other deleterious materials and protection of employee health and safety. Such
laws and regulations as subject to constant review by lawmakers and regulators, which may result in future regulations that
impose stricter environmental or employee safety requirements affecting Titan Group's operations.

Such laws and regulations impose additional requirements regarding consumer health and safety, such as potential
restrictions on the use of bisphenol-A, a starting material used to produce internal and external coatings for some food and
aerosol containers and metal closures. In Europe, certain nations, including Denmark, Belgium and France, have implemented
or considered implementing legislation restricting the use of bisphenol-A, including imposing product labeling requirements
or restrictions on the importation and placement in the market of packaging and utensils containing bisphenol-A, and the
European Food Safety Authority has recommended that the tolerable daily intake of bisphenol-A be lowered. Domestic and
international or other regulatory authorities could further restrict or prohibit the use of bisphenol-A in the future. In addition,
recent public reports, litigation and other allegations regarding the potential health hazards of bisphenol-A could contribute to
a perceived safety risk about Titan Group's products and adversely impact sales or otherwise disrupt Titan Group's business.
While Titan Group is exploring various alternatives to the use of bisphenol-A and conversion to alternatives is underway in
some applications, there can be no assurance Titan Group will be completely successful in its efforts or that the alternatives
will not be more costly to Titan Group.

Also, for example, future restrictions in some jurisdictions on air emissions of volatile organic compounds and the use
of certain paint and lacquering ingredients may require Titan Group to employ significant capital investments at some sites in
order to provide additional control equipment or process modifications. Titan Group’s operations and properties must comply
with these laws and regulations. In addition, a number of governmental authorities in Europe have introduced or are
contemplating enacting legal requirements, including emissions limitations, cap and trade systems or mandated changes in
energy consumption, in response to the potential impacts of climate change. Given the wide range of potential future climate
change regulations in the jurisdictions in which Titan Group operates, the potential impact to Titan Group's operations is
uncertain. In addition, the potential impact of climate change on Titan Group's operations is highly uncertain. The impact of
climate change may vary by geographic location and other circumstances, including weather patterns and any impact to natural
resources such as water.

A number of governmental authorities in Europe have enacted, or are considering, legal requirements relating to
product stewardship, including mandating recycling, the use of recycled materials and/or limitations on certain kinds of
packaging materials. Such developments may increase the costs of certain input materials used to manufacture Titan Group's
products.

Sites at which Titan Group has production and manufacturing facilities may have a long history of industrial activities
and may be, or have been in the past, engaged in activities involving the use of materials and processes that could give rise to
contamination and result in potential liability to investigate or remediate, as well as claims for alleged damage to persons,
property or natural resources, even if the activity which caused the contamination was legal at the time it occurred. Liability
may be imposed on us as owners, occupiers or operators of contaminated facilities. These legal requirements may apply to
contamination at sites that Titan Group currently or formerly owned, occupied or operated, or that were formerly, owned,
occupied or operated by companies Titan Group acquired or at sites where Titan Group has sent waste offsite for treatment or
disposal. Our closure of a site may accelerate the need to investigate and remediate any contamination at the site.

Titan Group requires a variety of permits to conduct its operations, including operating permits such as those required
under various laws, including E.U. Industrial Emissions Directive, water and trade effluent discharge permits, water abstraction
permits and waste permits. We are in the process of applying for, or renewing, permits at a number of our sites. Failure to obtain
and maintain the relevant permits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.


-----

If Titan Group were to violate or fail to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations or its permits, it
could become subject to criminal, civil and administrative sanctions and liabilities, including substantial fines and orders, or a
partial or total shutdown of its operations. Titan Group strives to mitigate risks related to environmental issues, however, there
can be no assurance that current or future environmental laws or liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on Titan
Group’s financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.

**_Demand for Titan Group's products could be affected by changes in laws and regulations applicable to food._**

Titan Group manufactures and sells metal packaging primarily for the food can market. As a result, many of Titan
Group's products come into direct contact with food. Accordingly, Titan Group's products must comply with various laws and
regulations for food applicable to its customers. Changes in such laws and regulations could negatively impact customers'
demand for Titan Group's products as they comply with such changes and/or require Titan Group to make changes to its
products. Such changes to Titan Group's products could include modifications to the coatings and compounds that Titan Group
uses, possibly resulting in the incurrence of additional costs.

**_We may be subject to losses that might be completely or partially uninsured._**

We maintain insurance policies with respect to certain operating risks, including product liability, damage to property
(including buildings, plants, machinery and stock, including as a result of catastrophic events such as fire, flood, storms and
earthquakes), industrial accidents, third-party liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, and cyber-crime.

There can be no assurance that the level of insurance Titan Group maintains is appropriate for the risks to its business
or adequate to cover all potential claims. Certain types of losses may not be covered by our insurance policies and may be
either completely or partially uninsurable or not insurable on commercially reasonable terms. A completely or partially
uninsured loss suffered by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Further, Titan Group may not be able to obtain future insurance coverage at current levels or at all, and its premiums
may increase significantly on the coverage that Titan Group maintains or obtains in the future. We anticipate renewal of its
insurance policies on an annual basis or other periodic basis. The cost of coverage may increase to an extent that Titan Group
may choose to reduce its policy limits, increase its deductibles or retentions, or agree to certain exclusions from its coverage.
Among other factors, the COVID-19 pandemic, adverse political developments, security concerns and natural disasters in any
country in which Titan Group operates may materially adversely affect available insurance coverage and result in increased
premiums for available coverage and additional exclusions from coverage.

**_Titan Group is subject to litigation risks which could negatively impact its operations and net income._**

Titan Group is involved in various litigation matters, and Titan Group anticipates that it will be involved in litigation
matters from time to time in the future. The risks inherent in our business expose us to litigation, including personal injury,
environmental litigation, contractual litigation with customers and suppliers, intellectual property litigation, tax or employment
disputes, insurance related lawsuits and product liability claims. In addition, Titan Group could incur substantial costs and fees
in defending itself or in asserting its rights in these actions. Titan Group is currently unable to determine the total expense or
possible loss, if any, that may ultimately be incurred in the resolution of such legal proceedings. Regardless of the ultimate
outcome of such legal proceedings, they could result in significant diversion of time by Titan Group's management. The results
of Titan Group's pending legal proceedings, including any potential settlements, are uncertain and the outcome of these disputes
may decrease its cash available for operations and investment, restrict its operations or otherwise negatively impact its business,
operating results, financial condition and cash flow. Existing or future material litigation, arbitration or other proceedings could
have adverse reputational and financial consequences for Titan Group and it may not have established adequate provisions for
any potential losses associated with such litigation or other proceedings not otherwise covered by insurance, which could have
a material adverse effect on Titan Group’s business, financial condition or results of operations.

**_The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union and any future changes within or between the United_**
**_Kingdom and the European Union, respectively, may have a negative effect on Titan Group's financial condition and results_**
**_of operations._**

Approximately 12% of Titan Group's total 2020 revenue was derived from revenues generated in the United Kingdom,
and 5 of its 44 manufacturing facilities are located in the United Kingdom, as of December 31, 2020.

The relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union is governed by a Withdrawal Agreement
entered into at the end of January 2020, and a Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which took effect from January 1, 2021 (the


-----

"Brexit Agreements"). The Brexit Agreements provide for a zero tariff, zero quota arrangement on sales of goods and
agriproducts between the United Kingdom and the European Union. Customs duties on goods originating outside the European
Union or United Kingdom, or in the event that the zero tariff arrangements under the Brexit Agreements are amended or
suspended, might lead to additional costs for products and materials shipped from the United Kingdom to Europe or from
Europe to the United Kingdom, respectively. Further, required changes to Titan Group's business systems and processes in
order to comply with newly introduced customs procedures may lead to additional costs.

More generally, differences in standards or processes or risk aversion may mean that some businesses choose not to
serve other markets on a temporary or permanent basis, causing supplier disruption. Uncertainty remains regarding the impact
of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union ("Brexit") and the Brexit Agreements on the United
Kingdom and Europe, including among commercial parties in the United Kingdom and the European Union, financial
institutions, suppliers and service providers and their respective customers. Any changes to the trading relationship between
the United Kingdom and the European Union arising from the Brexit Agreements may adversely affect the cost or timing of
imports, including key input materials used to manufacture the Group’s products.

Some of our customers are based in the United Kingdom and export outside the local United Kingdom market. These
customers may experience reduced demand or delays arising from these post-Brexit arrangements. Although Titan Group seeks
to export through channels where delays would be minimized, Titan Group has nonetheless experienced slight delays in the
transport of certain products, consumables and other materials particularly in relation to shipments from the United Kingdom
to the European Union. The impact of these delays, if prolonged, could adversely affect Titan Group’s business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Brexit may also have an adverse impact on Titan Group’s business, employees and customers in the United Kingdom.
In particular, the Brexit Agreements allow for the possibility of future changes in laws and regulations. Such changes could
include import, tax and employment laws and regulations, which could adversely impact the results of operations of Titan
Group’s United Kingdom business. For example, there is uncertainty with regard to the upcoming regulatory regime relating
to environmental permits and permissions, with such environmental permits and permissions currently governed by the EU
Industrial Emissions Directive (Directive 2010/75/EU). More burdensome requirements imposed by the new upcoming
regulatory regime could require that Titan Group commits additional resources to ensure compliance and although Titan Group
will use reasonable efforts to ensure such compliance, the introduction of new regulations increases the risk of non-compliance.

Further, continued political uncertainty as a result of Brexit may result in negative effects on credit markets, and
foreign direct investments in Europe and the United Kingdom. It may also result in volatility in the British pound foreign
exchange markets and interest rates.

Brexit could also lead to legal and regulatory uncertainty and politically divergent national laws and regulations as a
new relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union is defined and the United Kingdom determines which
European Union laws to replace or amend. Volatility in political, regulatory, economic or market conditions could adversely
affect employment rates, increase consumer and commercial bankruptcy filings, negatively impact national and local
economies, and cause other results that negatively affect household incomes.

The economic outlook could be further adversely affected by the risk that one or more European Union member states
could also leave the European Union, the risk of a demand for independence by Scotland or Northern Ireland, or the risk that
the euro as the single currency of any or all of the Eurozone member states could cease to exist. These developments, or the
perception that any of them could occur, may have a material adverse effect on the stability of global financial markets, and
could significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial
markets. Asset valuations, currency exchange rates and credit ratings may be especially subject to increased market volatility.
These negative impacts could adversely affect Titan Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Titan Group is exposed to risks in relation to compliance with anti-corruption laws and regulations and economic_**
**_sanctions programs._**

Titan Group has operations spanning over 14 countries, that are subject to anti-corruption laws and sanctions
regulations concerning both private-sector and public-sector corruption in various jurisdictions where Titan Group does
business (collectively, “Anti-Corruption Laws”). Further, the nature of Company’s manufacturing and other business
operations may bring Titan Group, its employees and third parties acting on its behalf into contact with government officials,
including employees of state-owned business enterprises, who may be considered government officials under applicable AntiCorruption Laws and therefore represent a high risk for public-sector corruption. Although Titan Group has policies and
procedures that require compliance with applicable Anti-Corruption Laws, there can be no assurance that the policies and


-----

procedures will be followed at all times or effectively detect and prevent all violations of the applicable laws by one or more
of its employees, consultants, agents or partners for which Titan Group could be held responsible.

Titan Group is also subject to financial sanctions and export controls (collectively, “Trade Controls”) imposed by the
United Nations, the European Union, the U.S., the U.K., and other authorities with jurisdiction over its operations. These Trade
Controls will from time to time prohibit or restrict our ability to engage in transactions and dealings in certain countries and
with certain designated persons. Titan Group has policies and procedures designed to maintain compliance with Trade Controls,
and it is not aware of instances of non-compliance with United Nations, U.S., European Union, U.K. or other applicable Trade
Controls. Although Titan Group has policies and procedures that require compliance with applicable Trade Controls, there can
be no assurance that the policies and procedures will be followed at all times or effectively detect and prevent all violations of
the Trade Controls by one or more of its employees, consultants, agents or partners for which Titan Group could be held
responsible.

Violations of Anti-Corruption Laws or Trade Controls could subject Titan Group to significant penalties, including
civil or criminal fines and penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions, debarment from government contracting (and
termination of existing contracts), and related lawsuits and other remedial measures. Investigations of potential violations of
these laws and regulations can also be costly and divert management’s attention from the business. As such, violations and
potential violations of Anti-Corruption Laws or Trade Controls can have a significant impact on Titan Group’s reputation,
business, results of operation and financial condition.

**_Titan Group is subject to the effects of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, which may reduce its net sales and_**
**_cash flow._**

Titan Group is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies as a significant portion of its consolidated net sales, costs,
assets and liabilities, are denominated in currencies other than US Dollar, including the British Sterling, and Euro. During the
year ended December 31, 2020, substantially all of our net sales were denominated in or linked to currencies other than the US
Dollar. As Titan Group currently prepares its financial statements in its reporting currency, the US Dollar, Titan Group must
currently translate the assets, liabilities, revenue and costs of all of its operations into US Dollar at then applicable exchange
rates. See “Management’s Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations.”

Going forward Titan Group will prepare its financial statements in Euro as its reporting currency. During the year
ended December 31, 2020, 26% of our net sales were denominated in or linked to currencies other than the Euro.
Correspondingly, Titan Group will translate the assets, liabilities, revenue and costs of all of its operations into Euro at then
applicable exchange rates. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.”

In addition to affecting the presentation of our financial results, volatility in exchange rates may increase the costs of
Titan Group’s products, impair the purchasing power of its customers in different markets, result in significant competitive
benefit to certain of its competitors who incur a material part of their costs in other currencies than it does, and increase its
hedging costs and limit its ability to hedge exchange rate exposure. In the Audited Combined Financial Statements and the
Unaudited Interim Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, Titan Group translates local currency financial results into
US Dollar based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period. During times of a strengthening US Dollar,
its reported international revenue and earnings have been reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer US
Dollars. Conversely, a weakening US Dollar will effectively increase the Dollar-equivalent of Titan Group's expenses and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Going forward, the same dynamics will apply vis-à-vis the Euro. Although Titan
Group may use financial instruments such as foreign currency forwards from time to time to reduce its exposure to transactional
foreign exchange exposure in some cases, it may not elect or have the ability to implement hedges or, if it does implement
them, there can be no assurance that such agreements will achieve the desired effect.

**_Changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements and other laws could negatively affect Titan Group's_**
**_financial results._**

New accounting standards or pronouncements that may become applicable to Titan Group from time to time, or
changes in the interpretation of existing standards and pronouncements, could have a significant effect on Titan Group's
reported results for the affected periods. Titan Group is also subject to income tax in the numerous jurisdictions in which Titan
Group operates. Increases in income tax rates or other changes to tax laws could reduce Titan Group's after-tax income from
affected jurisdictions or otherwise affect Titan Group's tax liability.


-----

In addition, Titan Group's products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many
jurisdictions in which it operates. Increases in indirect taxes could affect Titan Group's products' affordability and therefore
reduce demand for its products.

**_Titan Group may have exposure to greater than expected tax liabilities resulting from tax disputes, tax audits,_**
**_adverse decisions by tax authorities or changes in tax treaties, laws, regulations or the interpretations thereof._**

The tax laws and regulations in the numerous jurisdictions in which Titan Group operates may be subject to change
and there may be changes in the content as well as in the interpretation and enforcement of tax law. As a result, Titan Group
may face increases in taxes payable if tax rates increase, or if tax laws and regulations are modified by the competent authorities
in an adverse manner. Any change in local or international tax rules, for example prompted by the implementation of the
OECD’s recommendations on Base Erosion and Profits Shifting (a global initiative to improve the fairness and integrity of tax
systems), or new challenges by tax authorities, may have an adverse effect on Titan Group’s tax positions and its financial
results.

In addition, tax laws and regulations could change and could be subject to changes in their interpretation and in the
application thereof. In particular, in the current macroeconomic environment, governmental authorities could decide to increase
tax rates, to eliminate existing tax exemptions, to expand tax bases, or to introduce new taxes. As a result, Titan Group could
undergo an increase in its tax burden if tax rates rise or if legislation or the interpretation thereof by the administration changes,
which could adversely affect Titan Group’s business, results of operations and financial condition and reduce the cash flow
available to service Titan Group’s indebtedness.

**_Certain tax rules could limit the ability of Titan Group to deduct interest for tax purposes, thus reducing the net_**
**_cash position of Titan Group._**

Certain interest deduction limitation rules applicable in the jurisdictions we operate in, including interest deduction
limitation rules that are based on European directives such as the Council Directive (EU) 2016/1164 of 12 July 2016 and
Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 of May 29, 2017 may limit Titan Group’s ability to deduct interest accrued on Titan Group’s
indebtedness for tax purposes and, as a consequence, may increase Titan Group’s tax burden, which could adversely affect
Titan Group’s business, results of operations and financial condition and reduce the cash flow available to service Titan Group’s
indebtedness.

**_Titan Group has a significant amount of goodwill that, if impaired in the future, would result in lower reported net_**
**_income and a reduction of its net worth._**

Impairment of Titan Group's goodwill would require a write down of goodwill, which would reduce Titan Group's net
income in the period of any such write down. Titan Group is required to evaluate goodwill reflected on its balance sheet at least
annually, or when circumstances indicate a potential impairment. If it determines that the goodwill is impaired, Titan Group
would be required to write off a portion or all of the goodwill.

**_The loss of Titan Group's intellectual property rights may negatively impact its ability to compete._**

If Titan Group is unable to maintain the proprietary nature of its technologies, its competitors may use its technologies
to compete with it. Titan Group has a number of patents covering various aspects of its products, including Orbit, Ecopeel and
Peelfit. Titan Group's patents may not withstand challenge in litigation, and patents do not ensure that competitors will not
develop competing products or infringe upon Titan Group's patents. Moreover, the costs of litigation to defend Titan Group's
patents could be substantial and may outweigh the benefits of enforcing its rights under its patents. Titan Group also relies on
trade secrets, know-how and other unpatented proprietary technology, and others may independently develop the same or
similar technology or otherwise obtain access to Titan Group's unpatented technology.

**_Titan Group’s business operations and financial position could be adversely affected by the coronavirus outbreak._**

The ongoing global outbreak of coronavirus, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on
March 11, 2020 has caused and is continuing to cause business slowdowns and shutdowns and turmoil in the financial markets
both in Europe and abroad. Titan Group is closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on all aspects of its business and
geographies, including how it has impacted and will impact Titan Group’s employees, customers, suppliers and distribution
channels. The pandemic, as well as the quarantines and other governmental and non-governmental restrictions which have been
imposed throughout the world in an effort to contain or mitigate it, has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic
disruption which may materially and adversely affect Titan Group’s results of operations, cash flows and financial position or


-----

Titan Group’s ability to execute its short- and long-term business strategies and initiatives. For example, governmental
authorities in many European countries have ordered, at various times over 2020 and the first half of 2021, the cessation of all
business activity which is deemed non-essential and there is a risk that these shutdown orders will be extended or expanded or
that similar shutdown orders will be implemented in other regions.

The magnitude of COVID-19’s ultimate impact on Titan Group will depend on numerous evolving factors, future
developments and cascading effects of the coronavirus pandemic that Titan Group is not able to predict, including: the severity
of the outbreak and the international actions that are being taken to contain and treat it; the duration of the outbreak and the
myriad of business restrictions being imposed as a result of it; governmental, business and other responses to the outbreak
(including limitations on Titan Group’s operations and/or mandates that Titan Group provide products or services); the extent
and duration of the effect of the outbreak on consumer confidence and spending, customer demand and buying patterns; the
promotion of “social distancing” and the adoption of lock-down orders and restrictions on exports affecting customers’ demand
for Titan Group’s products; the extent to which forced remote working arrangements reduce Titan Group’s ability to effectively
manage its global operations; the impact of the outbreak on Titan Group’s supply chain (including reductions in supply that
may result in an inability to meet customer demand); the impact of the outbreak on internal controls (including those over
financial reporting); the speed and success of vaccination efforts; any impairment in value of Titan Group’s tangible or
intangible assets which could be recorded as a result of a weaker economic conditions; and the effect of the ongoing disruption
in the capital markets on Titan Group’s ability to access capital on favorable terms and continue to meet its liquidity needs.
Moreover, employee absenteeism due to members of Titan Group’s workforce being quarantined or exposed to COVID-19
may impact Titan Group’s ability to meet staffing needs which, compounded with the effects of ongoing office and potential
factory closures, disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure, border closures, and other travel or health-related
restrictions, may in turn impair Titan Group in the manufacture, distribution and sale of its products.

In addition, while Titan Group cannot predict the magnitude of the impact that COVID-19 will have on its customers
and suppliers or their financial conditions, any material effect on Titan Group’s customers or suppliers could adversely impact
Titan Group. The impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate other risk factors discussed, any of which could have a material
effect on Titan Group. For example, significant volatility in the equity markets could have a negative impact on the market
value of Titan Group's pension plan assets which may substantially increase Titan Group's future pension plan funding
requirements and could have a negative impact on Titan Group's results of operations, pension plan funded status and future
cash flows.

The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on Titan Group’s business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, as
information is rapidly evolving with respect to the duration and severity of the pandemic. At this point, Titan Group cannot
reasonably estimate the duration and severity of the coronavirus outbreak or its overall impact on Titan Group’s business.

**_As Titan Group seeks to expand its business internationally, business and financial results could be materially_**
**_negatively affected by various risks resulting from its broad geographic scope of its operations._**

Titan Group’s sales to developing markets and areas such as Africa and the Middle East generated approximately 12%
of its consolidated net sales in the year ended December 31, 2020. In some cases, countries in these regions have greater
political and economic volatility, greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions, greater risk of acts of war, terrorist
acts, and civil unrest, greater risks of political interference and differing local customer product preferences and requirements
than Titan Group's other markets. Operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries
exposes Titan Group to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural practices, business practices and legal and regulatory
requirements and risks that are subject to change and inconsistent application, including those related to tariffs and trade
barriers, investments, foreign currency exchange, currency devaluation, property ownership rights (including nationalization
or expropriation of privately-owned assets), taxation, repatriation of earnings, and regulation of advanced technologies. Such
expansion efforts may also use capital and other resources of Titan Group that could be invested in other areas. Expanding
business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations, which can materially affect Titan Group's
financial results. As emerging geographic markets become more important to Titan Group, its competitors are also seeking to
expand their production capacities and sales in these same markets, which may lead to industry overcapacity that could
adversely affect pricing, volumes and financial results in such markets. Although Titan Group is taking measures to adapt to
these changing circumstances and risks, Titan Group's reputation and/or business results could be negatively affected should
these efforts prove unsuccessful. Any of these conditions could have material adverse effect on Titan Group's business,
prospects, financial condition and results of operations.


-----

**_The downturn in certain global economies could have adverse effects on Titan Group._**

The downturn in certain global economies in which Titan Group operates could have significant adverse effects on
Titan Group’s operations, including as a result of any the following:

     - downturns in the business or financial condition of any of Titan Group’s key customers or suppliers, potentially
resulting in customers’ inability to pay Titan Group’s invoices as they become due or at all, or suppliers’ failure
to fulfill their commitments;

     - potential losses associated with hedging activity by Titan Group for the benefit of Titan Group’s customers
including counterparty risk associated with such hedging activity, or costs associated with changing suppliers;

     - a decline in the fair value of Titan Group’s pension assets or a decline in discount rates used to measure Titan
Group’s pension obligations, potentially requiring Titan Group to make significant additional contributions to its
pension plans to meet prescribed funding levels, see also “Risks Relating to Titan Group's Business and Industry
—We face costs associated with our post-retirement and post-employment obligations to employees which could
_have an adverse effect on our financial condition.”;_

     - the deterioration of any of the lending parties under Titan Group’s senior secured revolving credit facilities or the
creditworthiness of the counterparties to Titan Group’s derivative transactions, which could result in such parties’
failure to satisfy their obligations under their arrangements with Titan Group;

     - noncompliance with the covenants under Titan Group’s indebtedness as a result of a weakening of Titan Group’s
financial position or results of operations, see also “Risks Relating to the Notes—Restrictive covenants in the debt
_agreements governing Titan Group’s current or future indebtedness could restrict Titan Group’s operating and_
_financial flexibility.”; and_

     - the lack of currently available funding sources, which could have a negative impact upon the liquidity of Titan
Group as well as that of its customers and suppliers.

**_Titan Group may not be able to manage its anticipated growth, and it may experience constraints or inefficiencies_**
**_caused by unanticipated acceleration and deceleration of customer demand._**

Unanticipated acceleration and deceleration of customer demand for Titan Group's products may result in constraints
or inefficiencies related to Titan Group's manufacturing, sales force, implementation resources and administrative
infrastructure. Such constraints or inefficiencies may adversely affect Titan Group as a result of delays, lost potential product
sales or loss of current or potential customers due to their dissatisfaction. Similarly, over-expansion, including as a result of
overcapacity due to expansion by Titan Group's competitors, or investments in anticipation of growth that does not materialize,
or develops more slowly than Titan Group expects, could harm Titan Group's financial results and result in overcapacity.

To manage Titan Group's anticipated future growth effectively, Titan Group must continue to enhance its
manufacturing capabilities and operations, information technology infrastructure, and financial and accounting systems and
controls. Organizational growth and scale-up of operations could strain its existing managerial, operational, financial and other
resources. Titan Group's growth requires significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects,
such as the development of new products or enhancements of existing products or reduction of Titan Group's outstanding
indebtedness. If Titan Group's management is unable to effectively manage Titan Group's growth, its expenses may increase
more than expected, its revenue could grow more slowly than expected and it may not be able to achieve its research and
development and production goals, any of which could have a material effect on its business, operating results or financial
condition.

**_Titan Group’s business requires ongoing capital expenditures, which it may be unable to fund._**

Our business requires ongoing capital expenditures and our growth strategy may require significant capital
expenditures. Titan Group may not be able to make such capital expenditures if it does not generate sufficient cash flow from
operations, have funds available for borrowing under its credit facilities to cover these capital expenditure requirements or if
Titan Group were restricted from incurring additional debt to cover such expenditures or as a result of a combination of these
factors. If Titan Group is unable to meet its capital expenditure plans, Titan Group may not be able to maintain its manufacturing
capacity, which may negatively impact its competitive position and, ultimately, its revenues and profitability.


-----

**_Information technology (“IT”) interruptions, shutdowns, malfunctions, security threats and more sophisticated_**
**_and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions and services. Moreover, the_**
**_establishment of a standalone IT function could exacerbate these risks and lead to increased costs._**

Titan Group’s IT systems, or any third party’s system on which Titan Group relies, could fail on their own accord or
may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions or shutdowns, including interruptions or shutdowns due to natural disasters,
power outages or telecommunications failures, hacker or terrorist attacks, negligent or malicious activities of employees or
failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software or hardware. Increased global IT security threats and more
sophisticated and targeted computer crime also pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality,
availability and integrity of our data. We have a number of shared service centers where many of our IT systems are concentrated
and any disruption at such location could impact our business within the operating zones served by the impacted service center.
In addition, we are considering upgrades to our existing global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which will face
similar threats and vulnerabilities as traditional IT platforms. In addition, there can be no assurances that we will be successful
in implementing these upgrades or that their implementation will not result in disruption to its business.

While Titan Group attempts to mitigate these risks by employing measures, including employee training,
comprehensive monitoring of its networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, its systems,
networks, products, solutions and services and those of its third-party vendors and service providers, are vulnerable to security
incidents including, but not limited to, computer hacking, breaches, acts of vandalism or theft, computer viruses and other
malware, including ransomware or other forms of cyber-attack, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or
other similar events. A party, whether internal or external, that is able to circumvent our security systems could, among other
things, misappropriate or misuse sensitive or confidential information, personally identifiable information or other proprietary
information, or cause significant interruptions in our operations. Internal or external parties may attempt to circumvent our
security systems, and may in the future experience external attacks on our network such as reconnaissance attacks, denial of
service attempts and malicious software or phishing attacks. Techniques used to circumvent security systems frequently change
and can be highly sophisticated. As a result, detection of such attacks may not be recognized until such an attack has already
been launched against a target. In addition, such attacks may originate from less regulated, remote areas around the world and
Titan Group may be unable to proactively address all possible techniques or implement adequate preventive measures.

Depending on the nature and scope of the incident, such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of
confidential information, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products,
harm to individuals or property, contractual or regulatory actions and fines, penalties and potential liabilities, production
downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of
operations. Data protection laws are evolving and present compliance challenges, which may increase our costs, affect our
competitiveness and could expose us to substantial fines or other penalties.

Furthermore, in connection with the carve-out from Crown, Titan Group will transition its information technology
landscape from one embedded within Crown’s systems to a new, stand-alone platform. The transition process is expected to
involve material costs and expenditures and could involve or result in delays, malfunctions or other issues as more fully set
forth under the caption “—Risks Relating to the Acquisition—Titan Group’s ability to operate its business effectively may suffer
_if it is unable to cost-effectively establish its own administrative and other support functions in order to operate as a standalone_
_company after the expiration of the Transitional Services Agreement with the Crown Group.” As Titan Group builds its_
information technology infrastructure and transitions its data to its own systems, it may exacerbate any of the aforementioned
risks and incur substantial additional costs and experience temporary business interruptions.

We also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties that conduct business with us or our
customers and others who interact with our data. While Titan Group maintains insurance that covers certain security incidents,
it may not carry appropriate insurance or maintain sufficient coverage to compensate for all potential liability. Additionally, the
costs incurred to remediate any data security incident could be substantial.

**_A breach of data protection regulations may result in significant fines and penalties, ban on processing, affect our_**
**_reputation with customers and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

In the conduct of its business, Titan Group increasingly processes, collects, uses, transmits and stores data in its
technology systems. This data includes confidential information belonging to us, our customers and other business partners, as
well as information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, including our employees. Consequently, our business
is subject to a number of laws and regulations governing data privacy and security, including with respect to the processing,
collection, storage, use, transmission, sharing, and protection of personal data and other consumer data. Such laws and
regulations may be inconsistent among countries or conflict with other rules.


-----

For example, the European Union has adopted increasingly comprehensive and complex data protection legislation
and there has been a recent trend toward more stringent enforcement of requirements regarding protection and confidentiality
of personal data. The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) imposes strict requirements on controllers and
processors of personal data including, for example, higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their
personal data, more robust disclosures to individuals and a strengthened individual data rights regime, shortened timelines for
data breach notifications. The law is also developing rapidly and in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union
limited how organizations could lawfully transfer personal data from the EU to other jurisdictions. Data protection authorities
and competent courts from the different member states of the European Union may interpret or enforce the legislation
differently, which adds to this complexity, and data protection is a dynamic field where guidance is often revised, sometimes
with limited, if any, regard to legacy equipment or systems in use. Should Titan Group be found to be not in compliance with
data protection rules and regulations across the European Union, including the GDPR, Titan Group could be subject to
substantial monetary forfeitures, a ban on processing data or other penalties. Any unauthorized access to information stored by
us or by a third party, intentionally or accidentally, including failure to detect such access or to notify a supervisory authority
or data subjects in a timely manner, may cause damage to our reputation, constitute infringement of administrative and criminal
law and grant the affected persons a right to damage claims against us. Relatedly, following the departure of the United Kingdom
from the EU after the expiry of the transition period, the United Kingdom will operate a separate but similar regime to the EU
that allows for substantial fines.

In addition, given the global nature of its business, Titan Group is subject to data protection legislation in the countries
in which it operates. New and increasingly restrictive data protection regulations are being implemented globally, and Titan
Group must ensure that it is in compliance with these laws. Though Titan Group seeks to continuously improve its internal
systems to keep up with such changes in law in the countries in which it has operations, Titan Group can provide no assurance
that legislation will be followed at all times or that Titan Group will effectively detect and prevent violations of the applicable
laws by one or more of our employees, consultants, agents or partners and, as a result, Titan Group could be subject to substantial
penalties that could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.

Risks Relating to the Acquisition

**_Titan Group has no operating history as a standalone company and it may not be successful in implementing its_**
**_strategy as a standalone business._**

Our ability to successfully execute our growth strategy depends in large part on our ability to realize the anticipated
benefits from the separation from Crown, including (i) new markets and growth opportunities; (ii) procurement optimization;
(iii) manufacturing optimization; and (iv) commercial excellence and continuous improvement initiatives.

There are significant risks associated with the separation and there can be no assurance that Titan Group will be able
to achieve anticipated efficiencies following the separation from Crown. In particular, we may encounter challenges to business
continuity while central functions and delays or overruns in the implementation of the standalone IT systems.

In many respects, Titan Group will be dependent on Crown to manage these risks and operate the Titan Group business
on a transitional basis pursuant to the Transitional Services Agreement. However, there can be no assurance that the services
provided under the Transitional Services Agreement will meet our requirements in a timely and effective manner. It is also
possible that Titan Group may need to operate under the Transitional Services Agreement for longer than expected if Titan
Group is not able to implement current plans to build the relevant stand-alone business functions in a timely manner, as it may
be difficult for Titan Group to replace, or undertake on its own, the services provided under the Transitional Services
Agreement, at reasonable costs or at all.

A failure to implement Titan Group’s cost optimization and growth strategies, in whole or in part, including due to its
inability to realize the anticipated benefits from its separation from Crown and to successfully transition from its dependence
on the Transitional Services Agreement with Crown, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

**_The consent of certain customers of and suppliers to Titan Group is required to transfer their agreements and_**
**_working capital arrangements to the Issuer._**

The consent of certain counterparties to agreements of Titan Group and certain of their respective material customers
and suppliers are required to transfer those agreements to us. If these consents are not obtained, the business conducted by Titan
with these customers and suppliers may be curtailed or the terms under which Titan Group supplies to or buys from these
customers may change, which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and costs following the Acquisition. We also rely


-----

on such counterparties for trade finance to meet our working capital needs, and are in the process of rolling over certain existing
factoring and receivables financings. Therefore, even if such counterparties consent to transfer such agreements to us, if they
do not continue to provide us with the trade finance arrangements Titan Group has historically benefited from, there is a risk
that our working capital could be insufficient for the needs of our business. Additional working capital may not be available to
us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The Acquisition Agreement provides that if any of these consents are not
obtained before the Completion Date, Titan Group and Crown will cooperate with each other to put in place arrangements that
will give Titan Group the benefits and burdens of the agreements for which consents have not been obtained before the
Completion Date, but there can be no assurance that these arrangements will provide Titan Group with the same level of benefits
under these agreements as it would receive if these contracts had actually been assigned to Titan Group.

**_We are exposed to risks related to our supplier financing arrangements which may terminate at completion or_**
**_shortly following the Acquisition._**

Titan Group is party to several supply chain financing arrangements, in which a financial institution fulfils our
suppliers’ trade receivables on our behalf and we profit from extended payment terms. To the extent that these arrangements
are terminated in connection with, or following the Acquisition, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and
liquidity could be materially adversely affected by shortened payment terms, strains on liquidity and working capital
insufficiency.

**_The Acquisition is subject to receipt of certain regulatory approvals, which may entail delays or restrictions on_**
**_operating the Titan Group going forward that could materially adversely affect the business, financial condition and results_**
**_of operations._**

Before the Acquisition may be consummated, approvals or consents must be obtained from the EU competition
authority under applicable antitrust and competition laws. There can be no assurance that this required approval will be obtained
(or waiting periods will expire or terminate) on a timely basis. While the Acquisition Agreement provides indemnities with
respect to certain antitrust matters, there can be no assurance that such indemnities will be sufficient to compensate the Issuer
or Titan Group for any loss suffered in connection therewith.

In addition, the regulatory approvals may entail restrictions or required remedies to operating the Titan Group going
forward that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Acquisition is subject to successful completion of required works council consultations._**

Completion of the Acquisition is subject to completion of consultations with Titan Group’s works councils in France
and the Netherlands. The works councils have a right of consultation on proposed material actions of certain legal entities
within Titan Group, including certain Post-Completion Guarantors, such as contemplated acquisitions, dispositions, financing
arrangements (including the granting of guarantees or security), joint ventures and dismissals and appointments of directors. In
addition, works councils have a right of consultation on employment-related and labor-related matters. As a result, Titan Group
will need to complete the consultation processes in France and the Netherlands in respect of the local aspects of the Transactions
prior to the completion of the Acquisition. The satisfactory completion of these consultations, the consummation of the
Acquisition and the provision of guarantees by Titan Group entities which do not obtain any required consents from their works
councils, may not occur in a timely manner or at all. Please see “Summary—The Transactions—The Acquisition.”

**_The interests of the Sponsor may conflict with your interests._**

The Sponsor has and will continue to have, directly or indirectly, the power to affect the legal and capital structure as
well as the ability to elect and change the management and to approve other changes to operations and to influence the outcome
of matters requiring action by the Sponsor. The Sponsor’s interests in certain circumstances may conflict with the interests of
the holders of the Notes, particularly if Titan Group encounters financial difficulties or is unable to pay its debts when due. For
example, the Sponsor could vote to cause Titan Group to incur additional indebtedness. The Sponsor is in the business of
making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us.
The Sponsor may also pursue acquisition opportunities that are complementary to Titan Group’s business and, as a result, those
acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, the Sponsor may hold interests in suppliers or customers of
Titan Group. The Sponsor and their affiliates could also have an interest in pursuing divestitures (including one or more
divestitures of all or part of our business or sales of our shares which would result in changes to our shareholding structure),
financings, dividend distributions or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments, although
such transactions might involve risks to the holders of the Notes.


-----

**_Crown Group may compete with us in the future, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and_**
**_results of operations._**

While the Shareholders Agreement that will be entered into with Crown and Titan Group will restrict the ability of
Crown and its respective subsidiaries from competing with Titan Group’s business, it will not prohibit Crown and its
subsidiaries from engaging and participating in any capacity in the business of developing, manufacturing, marketing or selling
containers for the beverage market. The scope of the non-compete is also limited to the development, manufacture, marketing
or sale of metal food or specialty cans (including aerosol cans), in each case, as developed, manufactured, marketed and sold
by Titan Group on the Completion Date. Lastly, the non-compete is subject to expiration under certain conditions set out in the
Shareholders Agreement, most notably once Crown is no longer a shareholder of Titan Group. If Titan Group experiences
significant competition from Crown in the future, it could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results
of operations.

**_Titan Group’s ability to operate its business effectively may suffer if it is unable to cost-effectively establish its own_**
**_administrative and other support functions in order to operate as a standalone company after the expiration of the_**
**_Transitional Services Agreement with the Crown Group._**

We partially rely on administrative and other resources of the Crown Group, including information technology,
accounting, finance, human resources, procurement and legal to operate our business. In connection with the Acquisition, Titan
Group expects to enter into a mutual transitional services agreement with Crown to retain the ability for specified periods to
use these Crown resources. See “Related Party Transactions—Related Party Transactions—Transitional Services Agreement.”
These services may not be provided at the same level as when Titan Group was part of Crown, and Titan Group may not be
able to obtain the same benefits that it received prior to the Acquisition. These services may not be sufficient to meet Titan
Group’s needs, and after its mutual services agreement with Crown expires, Titan Group may not be able to replace these
services at all or obtain these services at prices and on terms as favorable as Titan Group currently has with Crown. We will
need to create our own administrative and other support systems or contract with third parties to replace Crown’s systems. In
addition, Titan Group has received informal support from Crown, which may not be addressed in the mutual Transitional
Services Agreement Titan Group expects to enter into with Crown on the Completion Date, and the level of this informal
support may diminish as Titan Group becomes a more independent company. Any failure or significant downtime in our own
administrative systems or in Crown’s administrative systems during the transitional period could result in unexpected costs,
impact our results and/or prevent us from paying our suppliers or employees and performing other administrative services on
a timely basis.

Because Titan Group has not operated as a stand-alone company in the past, Titan Group may need to acquire assets,
obtain business services and hire employees in addition to those transferred by Crown in connection with the separation.
Moreover, as a smaller company with a different ownership structure than Crown, Titan Group may have difficulty retaining
employees who are transferred pursuant to the separation. We may face difficulty integrating newly acquired assets, newly
contracted services and newly hired employees into the business. In particular, Titan Group has a large number of staffing
vacancies relative to the positions that are expected to be required to be filled once the Transitional Services Agreement
terminates and the separation is fully completed. If Titan Group is unable to retain, recruit, hire and train a sufficient number
of qualified individuals to fill these vacancies, or if Titan Group is only able to do so at higher than expected cost due to
competition or any other reason, its ability to successfully operate as a stand-alone business will be compromised.

**_Following the separation, Titan Group may experience increased costs resulting from a decrease in its purchasing_**
**_power relative to the purchasing power it possessed when it was owned by Crown._**

Historically, Titan Group has been able to take advantage of Crown’s economies of scale and purchasing power in
purchasing raw materials, marketing and distribution services, technology and corporate services, including insurance, legal
and tax services, employee benefit support, finance and treasury functions, and audit services. Following Titan Group’s
separation from Crown pursuant to the Transactions, Titan Group will be a smaller and less diversified company than Crown,
and will not have access to financial and other resources comparable to those of Crown prior to the separation. As a separate,
stand-alone company, Titan Group may be unable to obtain the foregoing goods and services at prices and on terms as favorable
as those available to Titan Group prior to the separation, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial
condition and results of operations.


-----

**_Following the separation, Titan Group may need to offer customers increased discounts, lose distribution and_**
**_potentially lose volumes resulting from a decrease in its selling power relative to Titan Group’s selling power when it was_**
**_owned by Crown._**

As a smaller company, Titan Group may have a reduced ability to obtain favorable pricing or trade terms from the
customers who purchase its products. Some customers may take advantage of the fact that Titan Group is a smaller business to
induce Titan Group to offer them additional discounts or other investments.

Additionally, following the separation, Titan Group will not be able to rely on Crown’s diversification, earnings,
assets, cash flow or credit, and will be responsible for obtaining and maintaining sufficient working capital and servicing its
own debt. There is a risk that market fluctuations and other events may adversely impact Titan Group more significantly than
if it were still part of Crown.

**_The Issuer does not control Titan Group until the consummation of the Acquisition._**

The Issuer not currently own Titan Group and the Issuer will not acquire Titan Group until the consummation of the
Acquisition, which is expected to take place in the third quarter of 2021, subject to antitrust clearances and other conditions.
The Issuer cannot assure you that during the interim period the business of Titan Group will be operated in the same way the
Issuer would operate it. Any of the risks associated with the Issuer’s lack of control over Titan Group until the consummation
of the Acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.

In addition, prior to the Completion Date, Titan Group will not be subject to the covenants described in “Description
_of the Notes.” As such, the Issuer cannot assure you that, prior to such date, Titan Group will not take an action that would_
otherwise have been prohibited had such covenants been applicable to it.

Risks Relating to our Financial Information

**_We have no operating history as a standalone company._**

The Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Condensed Combined Financial Statements
included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum have been prepared specifically for the purpose of facilitating the Offering.
The businesses, operations, assets and liabilities comprising Titan Group have not in the past operated as a separate stand-alone
entity or group, and, therefore, the Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Condensed Combined
Financial Statements are not necessarily indicative of future results of those businesses. The Audited Combined Financial
Statements and the Unaudited Interim Condensed Combined Financial Statements may not necessarily reflect what its results
of operations, financial condition and cash flows would have been had Titan Group operated as a separate, stand-alone company
or reporting segment during the periods presented in this Offering Memorandum and, in particular, the Audited Combined
Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Condensed Combined Financial Statements do not reflect the implementation
of the separation or management’s target operating model, which differs in substantial respects from the manner in which the
business has been operated under Crown.

The historical costs and expenses reflected in Titan Group’s Audited Combined Financial Statements and the
Unaudited Interim Condensed Combined Financial Statements include an allocation for certain corporate functions historically
provided by Crown, including legal, finance, human resources and other administrative functions. These costs benefit multiple
or all of Crown’s businesses, including Titan Group, and are allocated to Titan Group using an allocation methodology primarily
based on a percentage of sales. We believe the costs of these functions on a stand-alone basis will differ substantially from costs
allocated historically.

Moreover, the Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Condensed Combined Financial
Statements do not reflect the costs of borrowing funds as a separate entity. The balance sheet information in the Audited
Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Condensed Combined Financial Statements presented in this
Offering Memorandum was derived from Crown’s centralized financial information. It includes items that are directly
attributable and/or separately identifiable to Titan Group’s business together with an allocation of relevant balances from Crown
to Titan Group for those items that were not directly attributable or separately identifiable. A number of estimates, judgements
and assumptions were made for the purpose of allocating those items that were not directly attributable and/or separately
identifiable. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.” The balance sheet of the standalone business once the
separation from Crown is complete will differ substantially from the historic allocated balance sheet in many specific areas,
including working capital, debt, equity, intangible assets amongst others.


-----

The Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Condensed Combined Financial Statements
and the other historical financial information included in this Offering Memorandum do not necessarily indicate what Titan
Group’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or costs and expenses will be in the future. The adjustments made
to arrive at the pro forma and adjusted financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum reflect, among other
things, changes in Titan Group’s funding, operational model and overheads that are expected to result from its separation from
Crown. However, there can be no assurance that these adjustments will reflect its funding requirements and operating costs as
a separate, stand-alone company.

For a complete description of the accounting principles followed in preparing the Audited Combined Financial
Statements and the Unaudited Interim Condensed Combined Financial Statements, please see “Notes to Combined Financial
_Statements—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”_

**_Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA are based on assumptions that may_**
**_prove to be inaccurate._**

Our calculations of Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA are based on several assumptions that may
prove to be inaccurate.

We calculate Adjusted EBITDA by applying adjustments for non-operating or non-recurring items to EBITDA. We
calculate Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA by adjusting Titan Group’s Adjusted EBITDA to take account of the impact of savings
expected to be realized in connection with the procurement of raw materials, in particular tinplate, through inter alia negotiation
of price discounts in place of long payment terms and intensifying cross-functional cooperation to harmonize specifications of
raw materials.

In anticipation of becoming a stand-alone entity, Titan Group has entered into negotiations with third-party service
providers. We have also engaged several consultants and industry experts to assist us in the analysis of our anticipated cost
structure. Our assessments and estimates underlying our calculations of Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
are based on these expected contracts, meetings and discussions, the advice of such industry experts and consultants,
benchmarking against other companies within our industry and the industry experience of our management team. The expenses
that Titan Group estimates that it will incur through internal operations and with third-party service providers are based on
several assumptions, including assumptions regarding the volumes of services Titan Group will require from such third-party
service providers, the price at which such services will be offered, the number of employees Titan Group will require to operate
as a stand-alone entity and the salaries and benefits Titan Group will be required to pay such employees.

Titan Group cannot assure you that these assumptions will prove to be accurate. Furthermore, given these
uncertainties, Titan Group cannot assure you that the performance improvements reflected in Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
will be reached.

Some of our estimates of volumes are based on volumes that are implied from Crown’s historical allocations of
expenses to our business, which may not be accurate or fairly predict future costs and/or volumes. Where Titan Group anticipate
entering into an agreement with a third-party service provider, but do not yet have an executed contract, Titan Group based its
assumptions on both the price at which Titan Group expect such services will be provided, as well as the volumes of services
that Titan Group expects that it will require. Titan Group cannot assure you that its assumptions regarding such expenses will
prove to be accurate.

In calculating Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Titan Group also assumed that, after the expiration of the transition
period, Titan Group will no longer receive services from Crown under the Transition Services Agreement. Titan Group’s ability
to transition from the services Crown will provide to it during the transition period is subject to several risks and uncertainties,
including those described here, and Titan Group cannot assure you that it will not require services from Crown after the
transition period.

**_The Financial Statements are based on U.S. GAAP and there may be differences between our financial position_**
**_and results of operations prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and IFRS. In addition, should Titan Group decide to_**
**_adopt IFRS as its accounting reporting method, this could potentially result in material changes to certain of its financial_**
**_information from the information presented in this Offering Memorandum._**

The Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Condensed Combined Financial Statements
included in this Offering Memorandum are based on U.S. GAAP, which differs in certain respects from IFRS. We have not
presented a reconciliation of the Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Condensed Combined


-----

Financial Statements to IFRS in this Offering Memorandum. Because there are differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS,
there could be certain significant differences in our results of operations, cash flows and financial position, including levels of
indebtedness, under IFRS. In addition, Titan Group may adopt IFRS in the near future, which could potentially result in changes
to its results of operations, cash flows and financial position from the amounts presented in this Offering Memorandum. These
changes could result from, among other things, the different possible approaches toward impairment under IFRS and the
requirement to assess our assets and goodwill for impairment as part of the conversion from U.S. GAAP to IFRS. For a
discussion of the certain significant differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP, see Annex A.

Risks Relating to the Notes

**_Investors’ right to receive payments on the Notes and Guarantees is contractually and effectively subordinated to_**
**_certain of Titan Group’s indebtedness and obligations, including borrowings under the Credit Facilities Agreement, possible_**
**_future borrowings as well as indebtedness and obligations of Titan Group’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes._**

The Notes and the Guarantees will be contractually and effectively subordinated to the prior payment in full of Titan
Group’s and the Guarantors’ existing and future indebtedness that is senior in right of payment to the Notes, including its
obligations in respect of the Credit Facilities Agreement, structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the
subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes, including their obligations to trade creditors and other obligations
incurred in the ordinary course of business and effectively subordinated to all of the Issuer’s existing and future indebtedness
that is secured by liens that do not secure the Notes or that secure the Notes on a junior basis, to the extent of the value of such
property and assets securing such indebtedness. Because of the liens on the assets securing borrowings under the Credit
Facilities Agreement, in the event of the bankruptcy, winding-up, reorganization, liquidation or dissolution of the borrowers or
any guarantor of such indebtedness, the assets of the borrowers or guarantors would be available to pay obligations under the
Notes offered hereby and other unsecured obligations only after payments had been made on the borrowers’ or the guarantors’
secured indebtedness. Sufficient assets may not remain after these payments have been made to make any payments on the
Notes offered hereby and Titan Group’s other unsecured obligations, including payments of interest when due. Holders of the
Notes offered hereby will participate ratably with all holders of other unsecured obligations that are deemed to be of the same
class as the Notes offered hereby, and potentially with all of Titan Group’s other general creditors, based upon the respective
amounts owed to each holder or creditor, in Titan Group’s remaining assets. As a result, holders of the Notes offered hereby
may receive less ratably than holders of other indebtedness. In addition, all payments on the Notes and the Guarantees will be
prohibited in the event of a payment default on Titan Group’s secured indebtedness (including borrowings under the Credit
Facilities Agreement). See “Description of Certain Financing And Guarantee Arrangements.”

In addition, the Indenture will also provide that, except under very limited circumstances, only the Trustee will have
standing to bring an enforcement action in respect of the Notes and the Guarantees. Moreover, the Intercreditor Agreement and
the Indenture will restrict the rights of holders of the Notes to initiate insolvency proceedings or take legal actions against each
of the Guarantors under the Indenture and by accepting any Note each such holder will be deemed to have agreed to these
restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse in the event of a
default by the Issuer or a Guarantor under the Indenture.

**_The substantial indebtedness of Titan Group could materially adversely affect our business, financial position and_**
**_results of operations and prevent it from fulfilling its obligations under its indebtedness._**

Upon consummation of the Transactions, the Titan Group will have substantial outstanding indebtedness. As a result
of Titan Group’s substantial indebtedness, a significant portion of Titan Group’s cash flow will be required to pay interest and
principal on its outstanding indebtedness, and Titan Group may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or have
sufficient future borrowings available to enable it to repay its indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. Titan Group’s
indebtedness includes the Credit Facilities Agreement and the Notes.

The substantial indebtedness of Titan Group could:

     - make it more difficult for Titan Group and its subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations with respect to the Notes
and other debt and liabilities;

     - increase Titan Group’s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including rising interest
rates;


-----

     - restrict Titan Group from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities, including any
planned expansion in emerging markets;

     - limit Titan Group’s ability to make capital expenditures both domestically and internationally in order to grow
Titan Group’s business or maintain manufacturing plants in good working order and repair;

     - limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants under Titan Group’s indebtedness, Titan Group’s
ability to obtain additional financing, dispose of assets or pay cash dividends;

     - require Titan Group to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to service its indebtedness,
thereby reducing the availability of its cash flow to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, research
and development expenditures and other general corporate requirements;

     - require Titan Group to sell assets used in its business;

     - limit Titan Group’s ability to refinance its existing indebtedness, particularly during periods of adverse credit
market conditions when refinancing indebtedness may not be available under interest rates and other terms
acceptable to Titan Group or at all;

     - increase Titan Group’s cost of borrowing;

     - limit Titan Group’s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry in which it
operates; and

     - place Titan Group at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt.

If its financial condition, operating results and liquidity deteriorate, Titan Group’s creditors may restrict its ability to
obtain future financing and its suppliers could require prepayment or cash on delivery rather than extend credit, which could
further diminish Titan Group’s ability to generate cash flows from operations sufficient to service its debt obligations. In
addition, Titan Group’s ability to make payments on and refinance its debt and to fund its operations will depend on Titan
Group’s future operating performance and ability to generate cash from operations.

**_Titan Group may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness, including the Notes offered_**
**_hereby, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy its obligations under its indebtedness, which may not be successful._**

Titan Group’s ability to make scheduled payments on and to refinance its indebtedness, including the Notes offered
hereby, and to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts, will depend on Titan Group’s ability to
generate cash in the future. This is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors
that may be beyond Titan Group’s control.

There is no assurance that Titan Group’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future
borrowings will be available in an amount sufficient to enable Titan Group to service its indebtedness, including the Notes
offered hereby, or to fund its other liquidity needs. If Titan Group’s cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund its
debt service obligations, Titan Group may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek
additional capital or restructure or refinance its indebtedness, including the Notes offered hereby. There can be no assurance
that Titan Group would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would be successful and permitted under the
terms of Titan Group’s existing or future debt agreements or that Titan Group could release from these actions sufficient
proceeds to meet any debt service obligations then due.

**_Some of our indebtedness, including the Credit Facilities, will bear interest at floating rates that could rise_**
**_significantly, thereby increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow._**

Debt under the Senior Facilities will bear interest at a variable rate based on (for loans in euro) the Euro Interbank
Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”), (for loans in dollars, until the switch described below) the London Interbank Offered Rate
(“LIBOR”) or (for loans in sterling) the Sterling Over Night Index Average Rate (“SONIA”). On 31 December 2021, the rate
for loans in dollars will switch to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) administered by the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York plus a credit adjustment spread. In each case, these rates are subject to a zero floor if less than zero, and an
applicable interest rate margin will be added, and with respect to the Term Loan B Facility with adjustments also being made


-----

to the interest rate depending on certain ESG criteria. These variable rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our
interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our
ability to make payments on the Notes. Neither the Credit Facilities Agreement nor the Indenture contain a covenant requiring
us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt.

Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there
can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain
risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the
extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow.

Following allegations of manipulation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), a different measure of
interbank lending rates, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union have
conducted investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or
the calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition,
LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are the
subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for
Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial
instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30,
2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the
result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other
consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on July 27, 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that
it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021. Subsequently,
on March 5, 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that 26 LIBOR settings will cease to be published after
December 31, 2021 or, in respect of certain U.S. dollar LIBOR settings, June 30, 2023). The elimination of the LIBOR
benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law
enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, will require an
adjustment to the terms and conditions, and may result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark
(including but not limited to the Credit Facilities whose interest rates are linked to SOFR, SONIA and EURIBOR). Any such
change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported
EURIBOR or any other variable rate and/or a change to the benchmark by reference to which the interest on our floating rate
debt is determined, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of
interest.

**_Notwithstanding Titan Group’s current indebtedness levels and restrictive covenants, Titan Group may still be able_**
**_to incur substantial additional debt or make certain restricted payments, which could exacerbate the risks described herein._**

Titan Group may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, including in connection with acquisitions
or joint ventures. Although the Credit Facilities Agreement and the Indenture will contain restrictions on Titan Group’s ability
to incur additional indebtedness, those restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and,
under certain circumstances, indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Moreover, some
of the debt that the Titan Group may incur in the future could be structurally, contractually or effectively senior to the Notes.
The Titan Group may incur Indebtedness that shares in the Collateral or that is secured by collateral that does not secure the
Notes and the Guarantees. In addition, the Indenture and the Credit Facilities Agreement do not prevent the Titan Group from
incurring obligations that do not constitute debt under those agreements, including non-recourse securitization financings.

Titan Group may also consider investments in joint ventures or acquisitions or increased capital expenditures, which
may increase Titan Group’s indebtedness. Moreover, although the Credit Facilities Agreement and the Indenture will contain
restrictions on Titan Group’s ability to make certain restricted payments, including the declaration and payment of dividends
and the repurchase of Titan Group’s common stock, Titan Group will still be able to make such restricted payments under
certain circumstances which may increase indebtedness. Adding new debt to current debt levels or making otherwise restricted
payments could intensify the related risks that Titan Group and its subsidiaries now face. See “Capitalization.”, “Description
_of Certain Financing and Guarantee Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes.”_

**_If the Acquisition is not completed, you may not obtain the return that you expect on the Notes._**

Upon the issue of the Notes, the Initial Purchasers will deposit gross proceeds from the offering into an Escrow
Account to be held in escrow pending the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, including the completion of the
Acquisition, the receipt of approval from the EU competition authority, and the completion of required works council
consultations in France and the Netherlands. If the Acquisition has not been consummated by the Escrow Longstop Date or,


-----

upon the occurrence of certain events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. If this occurs, you may not
be able to reinvest the proceeds from the redemption in an investment that yields comparable returns. In addition, the escrowed
funds will initially only be in the amount of the gross proceeds received from the offering of the Notes, and will not be sufficient
to pay the special mandatory redemption amount, which includes accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the
redemption date. In the event that the special mandatory redemption price payable upon a special mandatory redemption
exceeds the amount of the Escrow Proceeds, the Sponsor will, pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter, be required to fund
any shortfall in the Escrow Account to cover the accrued and unpaid interest, and additional amounts, if any, owing to the
holders of the Notes and any negative interest charged on the Escrow Account. However, in the event such commitment is not
honored, the Issuer will not have sufficient funds to pay the special mandatory redemption price, and you may not obtain the
return you expect to receive on the Notes. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
_Redemption’’._

Although the Trustee, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, will be granted first-priority liens on the applicable
funds in the Escrow Account, the ability of holders of the Notes to realize such funds may be subject to certain bankruptcy and
insolvency law limitations in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Issuer. If the Issuer commences a bankruptcy or
insolvency proceeding, or one is commenced against the Issuer while amounts remain in the Escrow Account, applicable
bankruptcy or insolvency laws may prevent the Escrow Agent from releasing the escrowed funds or applying those funds for
the benefit of the holders of the Notes. The court adjudicating that case might find that the Escrow Account is the property of
the bankrupt or insolvent estate. As a result, holders of the Notes may not be able to have the escrow funds applied at the time
or in the manner contemplated by the Indenture and could suffer a loss as a result.

Moreover, there are uncertainties as to the validity and enforceability of the German law governed Escrow Charge as
a result of the Escrow Charge being granted to the Trustee for the benefit of the holders of the Notes who will not become
parties to the security agreement under which the Escrow Charge is constituted. As a matter of German law, to the extent
accessory security (akzessorische Sicherheit) such as, for example, pledges over bank accounts is concerned, the relevant
accessory security interest can only be granted to the creditor of the claim which is purported to be secured. Against this
background, the Indenture will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Trustee mirroring the
obligations of the Issuer and Guarantors towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture, and the
Escrow Charge will be granted to the Trustee as security for the “parallel debt” and will not directly secure the principal
obligations. As a result, holders of the Notes will bear some risk associated with a possible bankruptcy or insolvency of the
Trustee. In addition, there are no published court decisions confirming the validity of the parallel debt concept under German
law and, to the extent successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes might not (directly) receive any proceeds
from an enforcement of the Escrow Charge.

**_The Issuer is a holding company that has no revenue generating operations of its own and will depend on cash_**
**_from the operating companies of the Titan Group to be able to make payments on the Notes and the Guarantees._**

As of the Issue Date and prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuer will have no material assets other than the
interest in the Escrow Account into which the proceeds of the Offering will be deposited and which will be charged in favor of
the Trustee for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, pursuant to the Escrow Charge. If the Acquisition does not occur on or
prior to the Escrow Longstop Date or if certain other events that trigger escrow termination occur, the Notes will be subject to
a special mandatory redemption, and the Issuer will be dependent on any cash received from the Sponsor pursuant to the Equity
Commitment Letter or any third party financing it can procure in order to fund any shortfall in the Escrow Account, to cover
the accrued interest and additional amounts, if any, payable in connection with such special mandatory redemption and any
negative interest charged on the Escrow Account. See also “—Risks Related to the Notes—If the Acquisition is not completed,
_you may not obtain the return that you expect on the Notes.”_

Upon consummation of the Acquisition, the Issuer will be a holding company and all of its operations will be
conducted through its subsidiaries. Consequently, it relies on repayments of intercompany loans, dividends or advances from
its subsidiaries, including subsidiaries that may not be wholly owned. The ability of these subsidiaries to repay intercompany
loans or pay dividends, and the Issuer’s ability to receive distributions from its investments in other entities are subject to
applicable laws and other restrictions. In addition, such repayments, dividends and distributions may be subject to withholding
and other taxes which may lead to double taxation or other costs to the Issuer. These laws, restrictions, taxes and costs could
limit the repayment of intercompany loans and the payment of dividends and distributions, which could restrict the Issuer’s
ability to fund operations, and could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to make payments on the Notes.


-----

**_Restrictive covenants in the debt agreements governing Titan Group’s current or future indebtedness could restrict_**
**_Titan Group’s operating and financial flexibility._**

The Credit Facilities Agreement and the Indenture will contain affirmative and negative covenants that limit the ability
of Titan Group and its subsidiaries to take certain actions. These restrictions may limit Titan Group’s ability to operate its
businesses and may prohibit or limit its ability to enhance its operations or take advantage of potential business opportunities
as they arise. The Credit Facilities Agreement requires Titan Group to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other
financial conditions under certain circumstances. In addition, the Credit Facilities Agreement and the Indenture will restrict,
among other things, the ability of Titan Group and the ability of all or substantially all of its subsidiaries to (in each case, subject
to certain exceptions and carve-outs):

     - incur or guarantee additional debt and issue certain preferred stock;

     - make certain payments, including paying dividends or making other distributions;

     - repurchase capital stock and repurchase or redeem subordinated debt;

     - create or incur certain liens or security interests;

     - make certain loans, investments and capital expenditures;

     - create encumbrances or restrictions on the ability of a subsidiary to pay dividends or make other distributions,
repay loans, make loans or advances or sell, lease or transfer property to the Issuer;

     - sell, lease or transfer certain assets, and merge or consolidate with or into other companies;

     - impair security interests for the benefit of the holders or the Notes; and

     - engage in certain transactions with affiliates.

The breach of any of these covenants by Titan Group or the failure by Titan Group to meet any of the ratios or
conditions in the Credit Facilities Agreement and the Indenture could result in a default under any or all of the indebtedness
incurred thereunder. If a default occurs under any such indebtedness, all of the outstanding obligations thereunder could become
immediately due and payable, which could result in a default under Titan Group’s other outstanding debt and could lead to an
acceleration of Titan Group’s obligations under the Credit Facilities Agreement, the Indenture and other outstanding debt. The
ability of Titan Group to comply with the covenants in the Credit Facilities Agreement, the Indenture or agreements governing
other indebtedness it may incur in the future can be affected by events beyond its control and, therefore, it may be unable to
meet these ratios and conditions and could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain
cross default or cross acceleration provisions, including the Indenture. If its creditors accelerate the payment of those amounts,
Titan Group cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those
amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries that would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to
repay the Notes.

**_Titan Group is subject to certain restrictions that may limit its ability to make payments on its debt out of the cash_**
**_reserves shown on Titan Group’s combined financial statements._**

The ability of Titan Group’s subsidiaries and joint ventures to pay dividends, make distributions, provide loans or
make other payments to Titan Group may be restricted by applicable state and foreign laws, potentially adverse tax
consequences and their agreements, including agreements governing their debt. In addition, the equity interests of Titan Group’s
joint venture partners or other shareholders in Titan Group’s non-wholly owned subsidiaries in any dividend or other
distribution made by these entities would need to be satisfied on a proportionate basis with Titan Group. As a result, Titan
Group may not be able to access a portion of its cash flow to service Titan Group’s debt.

**_Not all of the Guarantors will initially guarantee the Notes._**

On the Issue Date, the Notes will only be guaranteed by the Initial Guarantor. The Indenture will provide that the
Completion Guarantors and Post-Completion Guarantors will become guarantors of the Notes by executing and delivering to
the Trustee supplemental indentures substantially in the forms attached to the Indenture on or about, or within 90 days from,


-----

the Completion Date, respectively, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and substantially simultaneously with the
guarantees granted in favor of obligations under the Credit Facilities Agreement. There can be no assurance that Titan Group
will be successful in procuring such additional Guarantees within the time period specified. The Guarantees to be provided by
the Initial Guarantor, the Completion Guarantors and the Post-Completion Guarantors will be limited as set forth in “Limitations
_on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_The Notes will not be initially secured by all of the Collateral._**

On the Issue Date, and until up to 90 days after the Completion Date, the Notes will not be secured by all of the
Collateral, as further described under “Description of the Notes—Security; the Collateral.” There can be no assurance, however,
that the Issuer will be successful in procuring the liens within the time periods specified. The security interests will be limited
as set forth under “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations,” which limitations could be significant. It should be noted that if a guarantee or a security_
interest granted by a Guarantor in certain jurisdictions is granted or perfected after the secured obligation arose, such guarantee
or security interest may be subject to clawback provisions under applicable local insolvency laws. See “Limitations on Validity
_and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_The Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over the Collateral, and the sale of particular assets could reduce_**
**_the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents relating to the Notes will allow the Collateral providers to remain in possession of, retain
exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral to the extent that it
relates to their assets. So long as no acceleration event has occurred and subject to certain conditions, the Collateral providers
may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect
to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of the Collateral and making ordinary course
cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness.

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Guarantees thereof or the Collateral across multiple_**
**_jurisdictions may prove difficult._**

The Issuer is organized and incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands and the Guarantors are organized and
incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, England and Wales, France, Germany, Italy and Spain, as applicable. In the
event of bankruptcy, insolvency, administration or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions.
Your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees and your security interests in the Collateral are likely to be subject to insolvency
and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your
rights in such complex proceedings. In addition, the multi-jurisdictional nature of enforcement over the Collateral may limit
the realizable value of the Collateral.

The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdiction of organization and incorporation of the Issuer and
the Guarantors may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and with the laws of the United States, including
in the areas of rights of secured and other creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain postpetition interest and the duration of proceedings. The application of these laws, and any conflict between them, could call into
question whether, and to what extent, the laws of any particular jurisdiction should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce
your rights under the Notes and the Guarantees and your security interests in the Collateral in these jurisdictions or limit any
amounts that you may receive. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and
_Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of_**
**_the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes will not be granted
directly to the holders of the Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Indenture will provide, along
with the Intercreditor Agreement, that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Security Documents. The ability of
the Security Agent to enforce the Security Documents may be restricted under local law. As a consequence of the right to
enforce the Security Documents, holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take
enforcement action in respect of the Collateral, except through the Trustee, which will (subject to the applicable provisions of
the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral.


-----

Under Dutch law, it is uncertain as to whether security interests can be granted to a party other than the creditor of the
claim which is purported to be secured by such security interests. As a consequence, of such uncertainties or restrictions, the
Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of parallel debt (“Parallel Debt”) obligations in favor of the Security Agent
mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and Guarantors towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the
Intercreditor Agreement (the “Principal Obligations”).

The Dutch law security interests will be granted to the Security Agent as security for the Parallel Debt and will not
directly secure the Principal Obligations. As a result, the holders of the Notes will bear some risks associated with a possible
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent.

In addition, the Parallel Debt construct has not been fully tested under Dutch law and, to the extent that the security
interests in the collateral created to secure the Parallel Debt are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes
will not (directly) receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral.

**_Investors’ rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the_**
**_Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority retained,
through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security interest. The security interest in the
Collateral may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if Titan Group fails or is unable to take the actions
required to perfect any such security interest (including obtaining any required consent from a third party, such as an account
bank, required to validly create security under any applicable agreement or terms and conditions). Neither the Trustee nor the
Security Agent will be under any obligation or responsibility to take any steps or action to perfect, or ensure the perfection of,
any security interests in the Collateral. Any failure to perfect any security interest in the Collateral may result in the invalidity
of the relevant security interest or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties,
including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral. For more information,
see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations.”_

**_The granting of the Guarantees and security interests in the Collateral may create hardening or voidance periods_**
**_for such Guarantees and security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of the Guarantees and security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or delayed
perfection of certain security interests following certain trigger events under the Security Documents, such as notice of the
occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture which is continuing, may create hardening or voidance periods for such
Guarantees and security interests in certain jurisdictions. The granting of shared security interests to secure future permitted
debt may restart or reopen such hardening or voidance periods in particular, as the Indenture will permit the release and retaking
of security granted in favor of the Notes in certain circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence of future debt.
The applicable hardening or voidance period for these new security interests will run as from the moment each new security
interest has been granted, perfected or recreated (as applicable). In each such case, if the security interest granted, perfected or
recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening or voidance period applicable in such jurisdiction, it
may be declared void and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

Similar considerations also apply following the issuance of the Notes in connection with the accession of further
subsidiaries as Guarantors and the granting of security interests over their relevant assets and equity interests for the benefit of
the holders of the Notes. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and
_Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_The Shared Collateral secures the borrowing under the Credit Facilities Agreement on a first priority basis, and_**
**_your rights to recover on such Shared Collateral will be limited._**

A portion of the Collateral, the Shared Collateral, will be pledged to the Security Agent for the benefit of the lenders
under the Credit Facilities Agreement, as well as to the Security Agent for the benefit of holders of the Notes. Under the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, the facilities under Credit Facilities Agreement are secured by first
ranking security interests in the Shared Collateral and the proceeds of any sale of the Shared Collateral on enforcement will be
applied first to repay all debt of the holders of the lenders under the Credit Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations.
Consequently, you may not be able to recover on such Shared Collateral because the lenders under the Senior Facilities and


-----

counterparties to certain hedging obligations will have a prior claim on all proceeds realized from any enforcement of such
Shared Collateral.

**_There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing_**
**_the Notes and the Guarantees will be released automatically without your consent or the Trustee or the Security Agent_**
**_obtaining your further consent._**

Under a variety of circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically, including a sale,
transfer or other disposal of such Collateral in a transaction that does not violate the asset sale covenant of the Indenture and in
connection with an enforcement sale permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement and with respect to the Escrow Charge, in
connection with the completion of the Acquisition and release of the

Escrow Proceeds. See “Description of the Notes— _Security; the Collateral.” The Indenture will also permit the Issuer_
to designate one or more restricted subsidiaries that are Guarantors as unrestricted subsidiaries. If the Issuer designates a
Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture, all of the liens on the Collateral owned by such subsidiary
and any Guarantees by such subsidiary will be released under the Indenture, subject to certain conditions.

In addition, the Indenture will provide that a guarantee of the Notes may be automatically and unconditionally released,
without action by, or consent of, any holder of the Notes or the Trustee, under various circumstances, including if the Guarantor
is no longer a guarantor under the Credit Facilities Agreement. Investors in the Notes will not have a direct claim as a creditor
against any subsidiary that is no longer a Guarantor of the Notes. See “Description of the Notes— _Guarantees.”_

**_The Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes._**

The Notes will be secured on the basis and priority set out in the Intercreditor Agreement by security interests in the
Collateral. The Shared Collateral will also secure the obligations under the Credit Facilities Agreement. The Collateral may
also secure additional debt, to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the Credit Facilities Agreement and the
Intercreditor Agreement. The security interests in the Shared Collateral may be diluted by any increase in the first-priority debt
secured by such Collateral or a reduction of the Collateral. The Collateral may also be released under certain conditions
provided in the Indenture or otherwise reduced in the future.

The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will depend upon
many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the condition of the economies in
which operations are located and the availability of buyers. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure
of realizable value for such assets. All or a portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable
market value. Likewise, there can be no assurance that there will be a market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market
exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in its liquidation. In addition, some or all of the Collateral may be of no value
if the TLB Borrower is subject to insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings.

**_The insolvency laws of the Netherlands, England and Wales, France, Germany, Italy and Spain, may not be as_**
**_favorable to you as those of another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar._**

The Issuer is organized under the laws of the Netherlands and the Guarantors are organized and incorporated under
the laws of the Netherlands, England and Wales, France, Germany, Italy and Spain, as applicable. Under Regulation (EU) No.
2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on Insolvency Proceedings (recast) (the “Recast
**Insolvency Regulation”), which applies in the European Union (other than Denmark) and, in the case of insolvency**
proceedings opened before December 31, 2020, in the UK, the court which has jurisdiction to open main insolvency
proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the member state or UK jurisdiction (as applicable) in which the company’s
“center of main interests” is situated. There is a rebuttable presumption that the “center of main interests” as defined in the
Recast Insolvency Regulation is the jurisdiction where the registered office is situated. Modified rules apply in the UK in
respect of insolvency proceedings opened after December 31, 2020 pursuant to the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit)
Regulations 2019 (which provide for a broader set of circumstances in which a company may enter insolvency proceedings in
the UK than applied previously). In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, it is not possible to predict with
certainty in which jurisdictions the insolvency or similar proceedings would first be commenced or how these proceedings
would be resolved. Proceedings could be initiated in the Netherlands, England and Wales, France, Germany, Italy or Spain, or
any other relevant jurisdiction, and your rights under the Notes and the Guarantees and your security interests in the Collateral
will be subject to the insolvency and administrative laws of the Netherlands, England and Wales, France, Germany, Italy and
Spain.


-----

The insolvency laws of foreign jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the bankruptcy
laws of the United States, or certain other jurisdictions you may be familiar with, and there can be no assurance that you will
be able to enforce your rights effectively in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or other proceedings. In addition,
the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Issuer and of the Guarantors’ jurisdictions of organization or
incorporation may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other and those of the United States, including in the
areas of the rights of secured and other creditors, the priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain postpetition interest and the duration of the proceedings.

In particular, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement could be limited in scope and effect by Italian or Spanish
courts to the extent their covenants and provisions, which are untested under Italian case law, could be considered to conflict
with mandatory provisions of Italian or Spanish law, as applicable. In the event that the Guarantor incorporated in Italy or Spain
experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or
similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings or their duration (which may be significantly
longer than the duration of analogous proceedings in jurisdictions you may be familiar with). As a consequence, enforcement
of rights under the Notes and the Guarantees in an insolvency situation may be delayed and be complex and costly for creditors.
See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations.”_

The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular
jurisdiction’s laws should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes and the Guarantees and
your security interests in the Collateral in these jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive. See “Limitations on
_Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” with_
respect to certain of the jurisdictions listed above.

Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable
principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could
limit the enforceability of a Guarantee against a Guarantor. In certain circumstances the court may also void a Guarantee if the
company is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law,
although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s
fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes.

In and outside of an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Issuer or guarantor of the Notes or the
appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the Notes, the security, the Guarantees, and intercompany obligations
generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds.
If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to:

     - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of the security or a guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee;

     - direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts received pursuant to any security or paid under a Guarantee
to the relevant security provider or guarantor of the Notes or to a fund for the benefit of the guarantor’s creditors;
and

     - take other action that is detrimental to you.

If Titan Group cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any security or Guarantee is found to be a preference,
transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, Titan Group cannot assure you that
Titan Group can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each guarantor of the
Notes under its Guarantees will be limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee not constituting a fraudulent
conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside.

The amount recoverable from the security providers and Guarantors may also be limited. However, there can be no
assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also
the possibility that an entire Guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. See “Limitations
_on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would, for
example, need to find that, at the time the security was granted or the Guarantees were issued, the relevant party:


-----

     - granted such security or issued such Guarantee with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or
future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others (and, in certain jurisdictions, even if the
recipient was aware that the guarantor or the collateral provider was insolvent when it granted the guarantee or
security interest), or created such security after its insolvency;

     - granted such security issued such Guarantee in a situation where a prudent business person as a shareholder of
such guarantor of the Notes would have contributed equity to such guarantor of the Notes or where the relevant
beneficiary of the Guarantee knew or should have known that the guarantor of the Notes was insolvent or a filing
for insolvency had been made;

     - received less than reasonably equivalent value for providing such security or incurring the debt represented by
the Guarantee on the basis that the security was granted and the Guarantee were incurred for our benefit, and only
indirectly the security provider’s or guarantor’s benefit, or on some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered
insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Guarantee, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons, (ii) was
engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the security provider’s or guarantor’s assets
were unreasonably small or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make
required payments as and when they would become due;

     - the security was granted or the guarantee was entered into within a certain time period prior to the opening date
of insolvency proceedings of the guarantor or collateral provider; or

     - the amount paid or payable was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law.

Additionally, pursuant to Spanish applicable legislation:

     - The general rule is that guarantees are ancillary to the guaranteed obligations and therefore are not abstract or
independent from such guaranteed obligations. However, under certain circumstances, the Supreme Court admits
the validity of first demand guarantees; although the abstract nature of the first demand guarantee and its
independence with respect to the principal guaranteed obligation is never absolute.

     - The laws of Spain may limit the ability of any Spanish guarantor to guarantee debt of a related company or grant
security on account of a related company’s debts. These limitations arise from the interpretations of various
provisions and from certain general principles of corporate law which include rules governing capital
maintenance, under which, among others, the risks associated with a guarantee or the granting of security to
guarantee or secure a parent or sister company’s debt need to be reasonable and economically and operationally
justified from the guarantor’s or grantor’s perspective. If these limitations were not observed, the guarantees or
security granted by any Spanish guarantor could be subject to legal challenge.

     - Guarantees are affected by a legal rebuttable presumption of detriment for the purposes of a claw back claim
(acción rescisoria) to be brought in case of Guarantor insolvency declared in the following two years after the
perfection of the Guarantee. The beneficiary of the Guarantor will be able to allege the Guarantor received an
equivalent compensation in exchange for providing the Guarantee.

Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a guarantor of the Notes generally may, in different
jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Guarantee if:

     - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets;

     - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or

     - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and liabilities,
including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute.

Although Titan Group believes that Titan Group is solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Acquisition, there
can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a guarantor of the Notes was “insolvent”
as of the date security was provided or the Guarantees were issued or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would
not determine that a guarantor of the Notes was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether


-----

or not a guarantor of the Notes was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Notes
constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Guarantees and Security
Interests, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency
_Law Considerations.”_

**_Each Guarantee and security interest in the Collateral will be subject to significant limitations on enforcement and_**
**_will be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability._**

The Guarantors will guarantee the payment of the Notes on a senior subordinated basis. Each Guarantee will provide
the relevant holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. In addition, the Issuer and Topco will secure
the payment of the Notes on the basis and priority set out in the Intercreditor Agreement by granting security under the relevant
Security Documents. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, lenders under the Credit Facilities Agreement and
counterparties to certain hedging agreements, and any additional indebtedness secured on the same basis, will have priority
over any amounts received from the sale of the Shared Collateral, pursuant to an enforcement action taken with respect to such
Collateral. There is no guarantee that the value of the Guarantees or the Collateral will be sufficient to satisfy claims under the
Notes.

The obligations of the Guarantors and the enforcement of each such Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount
that can be guaranteed by such Guarantor under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such
Guarantee is not in the relevant Guarantor's corporate interests, or the burden of such Guarantee exceeds the benefit to the
relevant Guarantor, or such Guarantee would be in breach of capital maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general
statutory laws or would cause the directors of such Guarantor to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal
liability and enforcement of each Guarantee/Security Document would be subject to certain generally available defenses. See
“Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations” for a description of certain of these limitations in several relevant jurisdictions. If one or more of these laws_
and defenses are applicable, the relevant Guarantor may have no liability, or decreased liability, under its Guarantee.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other laws, a court
could subordinate or void the Guarantees or the security interest granted under the Security Documents and, if payment had
already been made under a Guarantee or enforcement proceeds applied under a Security Document, require that the recipient
return the payment to the relevant Guarantor/security provider, if the court found that:

     - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds under the relevant Security
Document was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law;

     - the relevant Guarantee or security interest under a Security Document was incurred with actual intent to hinder,
delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor/security provider or, in certain jurisdictions, even
when the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor/security provider was insolvent when it granted the
relevant Guarantee or security interest;

     - the Guarantor/security provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the relevant
Guarantee/security interest and the Guarantor/security provider was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because
of the relevant Guarantee/security interest; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the
relevant Guarantee/Security Document; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness
beyond its ability to pay at maturity; or

     - the relevant Guarantees/Security Documents were held to exceed the corporate objects/corporate purposes of the
Guarantor/security provider or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor/security
provider.

Certain of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Netherlands, England and Wales, France, Germany, Italy
and Spain, as applicable. Enforcement of the obligations under a Guarantee against any such Guarantor will be subject to certain
defenses available to the relevant Guarantor. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance,
financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance, voidable preferences, thin capitalization or
similar laws as well as regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally, by limiting the amounts recoverable
under the Guarantees, as applicable, and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can


-----

be guaranteed or secured by a particular guarantor of the Notes under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that
the granting of such Guarantee is not in the relevant Guarantor’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Guarantee exceeds
the benefit to the relevant Guarantor, or such Guarantee would be in breach of capital maintenance, financial assistance,
liquidity maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of such
subsidiary guarantor to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. An increase in the amount of debt
that benefits from such Guarantee without a corresponding increase in the amount of the Guarantee will dilute the value of such
Guarantee to its beneficiaries, including the holders of the Notes. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Guarantees and the Security Interest and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

Accordingly, enforcement of any such Guarantee against the relevant Guarantor of the Notes would be subject to
certain defenses available to guarantors generally or, in some cases, to limitations contained in the terms of the Guarantee
designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant guarantors. As a result, a Guarantor’s
liability under its Guarantee could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law applicable to it. For further
information see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency
_Law Considerations.”_

In addition, where applicable, any “virtual tranching” structure aimed at identifying the relevant portion of the Notes’
proceeds which does not constitute “acquisition debt” in respect of the relevant Italian Guarantor and, indirectly, its subsidiaries
and, therefore, does not fall within the prohibition under Italian financial assistance rules (namely, Article 2358 or 2474, as
applicable, of the Italian Civil Code), is untested in Italian courts and it cannot be excluded that it might be deemed not sufficient
to clearly distinguish and separate the non-acquisition portion of the Notes’ proceeds from any portion of the Notes’ proceeds
to be utilized to support the acquisition or subscription by the Issuer of the share capital of any Italian Guarantor incorporated
in Italy and, indirectly, its subsidiaries. Should the Guarantee granted by the relevant Italian Guarantor be deemed by a court
or public authority to be contrary to any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as
applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, such Guarantee could be declared null and void. The Notes documents will provide that,
if and to the extent such Guarantee would result in a breach of any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles
2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code applicable to the relevant guarantor, the relevant guarantor will be
deemed to have no liability thereunder and the relevant Guarantees shall not be in force and effect.

In addition to the foregoing, and with particular reference to the Guarantees granted by any guarantor incorporated in
Italy, the first-priority ranking of the Collateral securing such Guarantees can be affected by a variety of factors, including the
timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under applicable law.

Furthermore, the Guarantees will be subject to exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections
permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, whether on or after the date the Notes are first issued. The
existence of such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the
Guarantees, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Guarantees.

Finally, there is some uncertainty under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction as to whether obligations to beneficial
owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in, nor are directly parties to, a guarantee (including the
Guarantees) will be validly secured and/or can be enforced. Due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and
perfection of guarantees and the enforceability of the latter, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel
debt” obligations in favor of the relevant Security Agent (“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of, inter alia, the relevant
guarantor owed to holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture, as applicable (“Principal Obligations”). All
or part of the guarantees (including the Guarantees) will be granted to the Security Agent as guarantees for the Parallel Debt
and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations, if permitted by local law. Under the provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations
and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in
respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the guarantees granted to
secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct guarantees and will not be entitled to take enforcement
actions in respect of such guarantees except through the Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk
of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct in financing transactions, including
credit facilities and bond issuances, has generally not been tested under all each jurisdiction, and to the extent that the guarantees
in the Guarantees created to secure the Parallel Debt construct are not validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully
challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such guarantees.

The liabilities and obligations under the Guarantee granted by any French Guarantor (as defined below) are subject to
(i) certain exceptions, including to the extent of any obligations which would constitute prohibited financial assistance within


-----

the meaning of Article L. 225-216 of the French Commercial Code or infringement of the provisions of Articles L. 241-3, L.
242-6 or L. 244-1 of the French Commercial Code and (ii) French corporate benefit rules.

Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing indebtedness of another company
that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition.

French law requires that, when a French company grants a guarantee on third-party obligations, the guarantee must
be in the corporate purposes and in the corporate interests of the guarantor company. Under French corporate benefit rules, a
guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee, taken
as a whole. A court could declare any guarantee unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant
guarantee, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if it found that these criteria were not fulfilled.
The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the
benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance.

Accordingly, the Guarantee granted by any French Guarantor and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited,
at any time, to an amount equal to the aggregate of the proceeds of the Notes to the extent directly or indirectly on-lent by the
Issuer to that French Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries or used to refinance any indebtedness previously directly or indirectly
on-lent to that French Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries, in each case under intercompany loans or similar arrangements, and
outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such French Guarantor under its guarantee. Any payment made
by such French Guarantor under its guarantee in respect of the obligations of any other obligor shall reduce pro tanto the
outstanding amount of the intercompany loans or similar arrangements due by such French Guarantor or its subsidiaries under
the intercompany loan or similar arrangements referred to above. By virtue of this limitation, the amount of the French
Guarantor’s obligations as Guarantor under the Guarantees could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the
Notes, and the French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation as Guarantor under the Guarantees should the portion of
the proceeds of the Notes made available to such French Guarantor directly or indirectly be equal to zero.

**_The Spanish Guarantees will be limited to a specified amount, and each Spanish Guarantee will be subject to_**
**_certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its_**
**_validity and enforceability._**

Each Guarantee provides the holders of the Notes with a claim through the Trustee against the relevant Spanish
Guarantor. However, the Indenture will provide that each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be
guaranteed by the relevant Spanish Guarantor without rendering the relevant Guarantee, as it relates to that Spanish Guarantor,
voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law, and enforcement of each Guarantee would be subject to
certain generally available defenses. In particular, the Guarantors incorporated in Spain as limited liability companies
(sociedades de responsabilidad limitada) will limit their Guarantees by a maximum amount equal to the double of their own
funds (recursos propios). In addition, the Guarantees will not guarantee any obligations which imply a breach of, respectively,
Spanish financial assistance regulations. Enforcement of any of the Guarantees against any Spanish Guarantor will be subject
to certain defenses available to Spanish Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. These laws and defenses generally include those
that relate to financial assistance, corporate interest or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference,
insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, claw back in insolvency, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more of these laws and
defenses is applicable, a Spanish Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability under its Guarantee depending on the
amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts
in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of any Guarantee against any Spanish Guarantor. For further information,
see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations—Spain.”_

**_The Credit Facilities Agreement, the Notes and other indebtedness provide that certain change of control events_**
**_constitute an event of default. In the event of a change of control, Titan Group may not be able to satisfy all of its obligations_**
**_under the senior secured credit facilities or other indebtedness._**

Titan Group may not have sufficient assets or be able to obtain sufficient third-party financing on favorable terms to
satisfy all of its obligations under the Credit Facilities Agreement, the Notes or other indebtedness in the event of a change of
control. If Titan Group experiences a change of control repurchase event, it will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding
Notes. However, Titan Group's senior secured credit facilities provide that certain change of control events constitute an event
of default or mandatory prepayment event under the senior secured credit facilities. Such an event of default entitles the lenders
thereunder to, among other things, cause all outstanding debt obligations under the senior secured credit facilities to become
due and payable and to proceed against the collateral securing the senior secured credit facilities. Any event of default or


-----

acceleration of the senior secured credit facilities will likely also cause a default under the terms of other indebtedness of Titan
Group.

In addition, the Credit Facilities Agreement contain, and any future credit facilities or other agreements to which Titan
Group becomes a party may contain restrictions on its ability to offer to repurchase the Notes in connection with a change of
control or otherwise. In the event a change of control repurchase event occurs at a time when it is prohibited from offering to
purchase the Notes, Titan Group could seek consent to offer to purchase the Notes or attempt to refinance the borrowings that
contain such a prohibition. If it does not obtain the consent or refinance the borrowings, Titan Group would remain prohibited
from offering to purchase the Notes. In such case, the failure by Titan Group to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a
default under the Indenture governing the Notes, which, in turn, could result in amounts outstanding under any future credit
facility or other agreement relating to indebtedness being declared due and payable. Any such declaration could have adverse
consequences to Titan Group and the holders of the Notes.

**_The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. In addition, under certain_**
**_circumstances, the Issuer may have the right to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection with a change of control offer,_**
**_even if certain holders do not consent to the tender._**

If a change of control (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, the Issuer will be required to make an offer to purchase all
the outstanding respective Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest
and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase. In such a situation, the Issuer may not have enough
funds to pay for all of the Notes that are tendered under any such offer. If a significant principal amount of Notes is tendered,
the Issuer will likely have to obtain financing to pay for the tendered Notes. However, the Issuer may not be able to obtain such
financing on acceptable terms, if at all. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes upon a change of control would
constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Credit Facilities Agreement.

In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control will be deemed not to
be a change of control, provided that upon consummation thereof, a certain consolidated total debt ratio of the Issuer and its
restricted subsidiaries is met.

In addition, in connection with a change of control offer for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate
principal amount of the applicable outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such change of control
offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a change of control offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases, all of the Notes
validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the relevant Issuer or such third party will have the right to redeem the
Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each
other holder of Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”

**_Investors in the Notes may not be able to determine when a change of control repurchase event has occurred and_**
**_may not be able to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes._**

Legal uncertainty regarding what constitutes a change of control repurchase event and the provisions of the indenture
may allow Titan Group to enter into transactions, such as acquisitions, refinancings or recapitalizations, that would not
constitute a change of control repurchase event but may increase Titan Group’s outstanding indebtedness or otherwise affect
Titan Group’s ability to satisfy its obligations under the Notes.

In addition, the definition of “change of control” in the Indenture will include the sale, lease or transfer of “all or
substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, to certain persons. Although there is a limited
body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under
applicable law. Accordingly, an investor’s ability to require the Issuer to repurchase their Notes as a result of a transfer of less
than all of the assets of Titan Group to another person may be uncertain.

**_Holders of the Notes may have adverse tax consequences in the event of an IPO Pushdown._**

Under certain circumstances, the Issuer may undertake an IPO Pushdown (as described in “Description of the Notes—
_IPO Pushdown”), pursuant to which the Issuer is entitled to give notice that the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor_
Agreement shall operate (with effect from the date specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice (as defined in “Description of
_the Notes—IPO Pushdown”)) so that, among other things, references to the Issuer and Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in_
“Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”) (and all related provisions) shall apply only to the IPO Entity (as defined in
“Description of the Notes—IPO Pushdown”) and its Restricted Subsidiaries. In such event, each holding company of the IPO


-----

Entity would be released from its obligations under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) and any security granted by it or any holding company of it.

Such modifications could be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a deemed exchange of (i) the Notes as in
place prior to such modifications for (ii) new Notes as in place after such modifications (the “New Notes”). If such
modifications result in a deemed exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it would generally be treated as a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes in which beneficial owners of the Notes would be required to recognize any
gain or loss. Furthermore, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the New Notes deemed issued in such a deemed exchange
could be treated as issued with original issue discount. In such event, U.S. Holders (as defined under “Certain Tax
_Considerations— Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) would be required to include the original issue discount_
in their income as it accrues, in advance of the receipt of cash corresponding to such income. In addition, the determination of
whether the New Notes are treated as “contingent payment debt instruments” as a result of the possibility of additional
payments, as further described under “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—
_Characterization of the Notes,” would be made at the time of the modification. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax_
advisors as to the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to potential modifications of the Notes in connection with the
IPO Pushdown.

It is also possible that the IPO Pushdown could result in a taxable event for tax purposes other than U.S. federal income
tax purposes.

**_Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the US Securities Act or the securities
laws of any state or any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States, or to, or
for the account or benefit of, US persons (as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act) except pursuant to an exemption
from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the US Securities Act and the applicable securities laws
of any state or any other jurisdiction. It is the obligation of investors in the Notes to ensure that all offers and sales of the Notes
in the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**_Certain covenants and events of default will be suspended if the Notes receive investment grade ratings._**

The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the date of the Indenture, the Notes issued under the Indenture
receive an investment grade rating from at least two of Moody’s, S&P or Fitch and no default or event of default has occurred
and is continuing, then beginning that day and continuing until such time as such Notes are no longer rated investment grade
by either ratings agency, certain covenants will cease to be applicable to such Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Certain
_Covenants— Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.” At any time when these covenants are_
suspended, the Issuer will be able to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay cash dividends and redeem
subordinated indebtedness without restriction, each of which may conflict with the interests of holders of the Notes. There can
be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating if achieved will be
maintained.

**_The Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the claims of creditors, including trade creditors_**
**_and preferred stockholders (if any), of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries._**

Generally, claims of creditors, including trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any) of non-Guarantor
subsidiaries of the Issuer, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are
made available for distribution to their respective parent entity or the creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors. Accordingly,
in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary of the Issuer becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is
otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

     - the creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors (including the holders of the Notes) will have no right to proceed
against the assets of such non-Guarantor subsidiary; and

     - creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any) will
generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before the
Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder (as applicable), will be entitled to receive any
distributions from such subsidiary.


-----

As such, the Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the creditors, including trade creditors and
any preferred stockholders (if any) of the non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer. In addition, the Indenture will, subject to
certain limitations, permit these non-Guarantor subsidiaries to incur substantial additional indebtedness without such incurrence
constituting a default under the Indenture, and such indebtedness may also be secured. The Indenture will not contain any
limitation on the amount of other liabilities, such as deposits and trade payables, that may be incurred by these subsidiaries. As
of March 31, 2021, after giving effect to the Transactions, our non-guarantor subsidiaries would not have had any external
financial indebtedness outstanding.

**_If an active trading market for the Notes does not develop, the liquidity and value of the Notes could be harmed._**

There is no existing market for the Notes. Titan Group intends to submit an application to list the notes on the Official
List of The International Stock Exchange and to trade the Notes on The International Stock Exchange. Even if Titan Group
submits such an application, it cannot assure that an active trading market will develop for the Notes. If no active trading market
develops, investors in the Notes may not be able to resell their Notes at their fair market value or at all. In addition, there can
be no assurance that the Notes will become or remain listed. If the Issuer cannot maintain the listing on the Exchange and the
admission to dealing on the Official List thereof, or if it becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the
Issuer may cease to make or maintain such listing on the Official List of the Exchange.

Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest
rates, demand for high yield debt securities generally, general economic conditions, Titan Group’s operating results, financial
performance or prospects or the prospects of the companies in the same industry and the market for similar securities. The
liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities.
Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial
volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on investors, as holders
of Notes, regardless of Titan Group’s prospects and financial performance. The Initial Purchasers have advised Titan Group
that they currently intend to make a market in the Notes after completing the Offering. However, they have no obligation to do
so and may cease their market-making activities at any time without notice. In addition, any such market making activity will
be subject to limitations imposed by the Securities Act and other applicable laws and regulations. As a result, there may not be
an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, investors may not be able to resell their Notes at a
fair value, if at all.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to_**
**_revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the
potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed herein and other factors that may
affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to
revision, suspension or withdrawal by the credit rating agency at any time. No assurances can be given that a credit rating will
remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating
agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the
credit rating assigned to the Notes or any indication from the ratings agencies that the Issuer’s ratings are under review by one
or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of Titan Group’s financings and
could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and, therefore, investors must rely on the procedures and the_**
**_relevant clearing systems to exercise their rights and remedies._**

Unless and until definitive registered notes are issued in exchange for book-entry interests in the Notes (which may
occur only in very limited circumstances), owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes.
Instead, the nominee of the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the Notes.
Payments of principal, interest, premium and additional amounts, if any, owing on or in respect of the Notes in global form will
be made to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent will, in turn, make such payments to the common depositary for Euroclear and
Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with the common depositary’s procedures. After
payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, the Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the
payment of principal, interest, premium or additional amounts, if any, to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if
investors own a book-entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and if investors are not
participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, they must rely on the procedures of the participant through which they own their
interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.


-----

Unlike holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon the
Issuer’s solicitations for consents or requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if investors own
book-entry interests, they will be permitted to act only to the extent they have received appropriate proxies to do so from
Euroclear and/or Clearstream or, if applicable, a participant. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the
granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable the investors to vote on any requested actions on a timely basis. The lack
of physical certificates could also:

     - result in payment delays on the Notes because the Trustee will be sending payments on the Notes to Euroclear
and Clearstream instead of directly to the investor;

     - make it difficult for the investors to pledge the Notes if physical certificates are required by the party demanding
the pledge; and

     - hinder the investors’ ability to resell their Notes because some investors may be unwilling to buy Notes that are
not in physical form.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until definitive registered Notes
are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own book-entry interests, they will be restricted to acting through
Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream may not be adequate to
ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.”

**_An investor may be unable to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities laws violations._**

The Issuer and the Guarantors are organized or incorporated outside the United States, and a substantial portion of our
business is conducted outside the United States. The directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors are nonresidents of, and substantially all of their assets are located outside of, the United States. Although the Issuer and the Guarantors
will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be
unable to effect service of process within the United States on the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the
Guarantors. In addition, as a substantial portion of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and their subsidiaries and those
of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce against them
judgments obtained in U.S. courts. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer and
the Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.

Additionally, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of foreign jurisdictions would enforce (i) judgments of
United States courts obtained against the Issuer, the Guarantors and the directors and executive officers who are not residents
of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the United States federal and state securities laws or (ii) in
original actions brought in such foreign jurisdictions against us or such persons predicated upon the United States federal and
state securities laws.

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters, with certain jurisdictions. For further
information see “Service of Process and Enforcement of Judgment.”

**_Investors in the Notes may face foreign exchange risks or adverse tax consequences._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euros. If investors in the Notes measure their investment returns by
reference to a currency other than the Euro, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange related risks due to, among
other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the Euro relative to the currency by reference to which the investors
measure the return on their investments because of economic, political and other factors over which Titan Group has no control.
Depreciation of the Euro against the currency by reference to which the investors measure the return on their investments could
cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to the investors
when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which they measure the return on their investments.
Investment in the Notes may also have important tax consequences as a result of any foreign currency exchange gains or losses.
See “Certain Tax Considerations.”

Titan Group, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee and the Paying Agent with respect to the Notes will not be obligated
to convert, or to assist any registered owner or beneficial owner of such Notes in converting, payments of principal, interest,


-----

premium or additional amounts, if any, or any redemption price made with respect to such Notes into US Dollars or any other
currency.

**_Trading in the clearing systems is subject to minimum denomination requirements._**

The Notes will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof. It is possible that the clearing systems may process trades which could result in amounts being held in denominations
smaller than the minimum denominations. If definitive Notes are required to be issued in relation to such Notes in accordance
with the provisions of the relevant global notes, a holder who does not have the minimum denomination or an integral multiple
of €1,000 in excess thereof in its account with the relevant clearing system at the relevant time may not receive all of its
entitlement in the form of definitive notes unless and until such time as its holding satisfies the minimum denomination
requirement.

**_The Indenture will not be qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended._**

The Indenture will not be required to, and will not be, qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended
(the “TIA”), and will not incorporate nor include, and will not be subject to, any of the provisions of the TIA. Consequently,
the holders of the Notes will not be entitled to the protections provided under the TIA to holders of debt securities issued under
a qualified indenture, including those respecting preferential collections by the trustee or conflicting interests of the trustee.

**_The Notes may be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

The Notes may be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Notes are issued
with original issue discount, in addition to the stated cash interest on the Notes, US Holders (as defined under “Taxation—
_Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations”) will generally be required to include the amounts representing the_
original issue discount in gross income on a constant yield basis in advance of receipt of the cash payments to which such
income is attributable. See “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.”

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The Offering is expected to be consummated prior to the completion of the Acquisition. Pending consummation of the
Acquisition, on the Issue Date, the Initial Purchasers will deposit the gross proceeds of the Offering into an Escrow Account.
The release of the Escrow Proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the closing of the
Acquisition. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

Assuming the release of the proceeds of the Offering from the Escrow Account on or about the Completion Date, we
estimate the aggregate gross proceeds from the Offering will be €375 million. We intend to use the proceeds from the Offering,
together with borrowings under the Term Loan B Facility and proceeds of shareholder contributions, (i) to pay the purchase
price of the Acquisition, (ii) to fund cash on Titan Group’s balance sheet and (iii) to pay the costs, fees and expenses related to
the Transactions, including the Offering. We currently expect no amounts to be drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility on
the Completion Date.

The following table illustrates the estimated sources and uses with respect to the Transactions. Actual amounts are
subject to adjustment and may differ significantly from estimated amounts at the time of the consummation of the Acquisition,
depending on several factors, including development in working capital, differences from our estimate of fees and expenses
and the timing of the Completion Date.

(2) Includes estimated shareholder funding from entities affiliated with KPS in an amount of €560.0 million and from Crown in an amount of €140.0 million
(pursuant to an equity roll-over as set out in the Acquisition Agreement) in the form of equity. Actual amounts may vary based on, among other things,
customary completion account adjustments as set out in the Acquisition Agreement.
(3) Actual amount may vary based on, among other things, customary completion account adjustments as set out in the Acquisition Agreement.
(4) Represents an estimate of the costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions. Actual costs, fees and expenses may vary and
additional costs, fees and expenses may be payable after the Issue Date out of cash flow generated through interim trading.

**CAPITALIZATION**

The following table sets forth consolidated cash and cash equivalents and consolidated capitalization (consisting of
total financial liabilities and shareholders’ equity) as of March 31, 2021 of the Issuer on an as adjusted basis to give effect to
the Transactions as if such events had occurred on March 31, 2021.

We have prepared the information presented in the “As Adjusted” column for illustrative purposes only. Such
information addresses a hypothetical situation and, therefore, does not represent our actual financial position or results.
Consequently, such information may not be indicative of our current total capitalization, or any other prior date. Investors are
cautioned not to place undue reliance on this hypothetical information.

This table should be read in conjunction with “Use of Proceeds,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Description of Certain Financing and Guarantee Arrangements,”_
“Description of the Notes” included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

Total equity[(7)] ............................................................................................................................... 700
**Total capitalization ...................................................................................................................** 2,279

(1) Cash and cash equivalents at the time of the Offering may be different than the amounts presented because of, among other reasons, interim trading. The
adjusted cash and cash equivalents amount represents our cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2021, adjusted to give effect to the assumed use of
cash and cash equivalents following completion of the Transactions on the Completion Date. Actual amounts may vary based on, among other things,
customary completion account adjustments as set out in the Acquisition Agreement.
(2) We currently expect no amounts to be drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility on the Completion Date. See “ Use of Proceeds.”
(3) Represents the total amount outstanding under the Term Loan B Facility.
(4) The Notes have been presented in the table at their aggregate principal amount of €375.0 million, which excludes capitalized issue costs of the Notes that
will be amortized over the life of the Notes as additional interest expense. Please see “ Description of the Notes.”
(5) Following the Completion Date, the Business will operate on a stand-alone basis independently of Crown, its United States parent. Given that none of
the Group’s operations are in the United States, we expect that our reporting currency will shift from the U.S. Dollar to the Euro and we anticipate
preparing our financial statements under IFRS. The amounts in this line item represent the total U.S. GAAP operating lease liabilities from the Audited
Combined Financial Statements as at December 31, 2020, as a proxy for the IFRS 16 lease liabilities and is based on a convenience translation of Euro
to US Dollar of 1:1.2163. See Annex A for a discussion of certain differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS.
(6) The amount does not reflect certain existing factoring and other similar arrangements of the Titan Group that are envisioned to be rolled over in connection
with the Acquisition. See “ Description of Certain Financing and Guarantee Arrangements”
(7) As adjusted figures include estimated shareholder funding from entities affiliated with KPS in an amount of €560.0 million and from Crown in an amount
of €140.0 million (pursuant to an equity roll-over as set out in the Acquisition Agreement) in the form of equity. Actual amounts may vary based on,
among other things, customary closing adjustments as set out in the Acquisition Agreement.

(1) We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental measures of our operating performance. EBITDA
represents operating income/(loss) plus depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as adjusted for certain non-operating
and non-recurring items as set forth below. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA on a pro forma basis for estimated procurement
savings. We believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information as supplemental measures of
performance and liquidity. We note, however, that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, may not be
comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our operating
results as reported under U.S. GAAP and have limitations as analytical tools. Some of these limitations include the following: (i) they do not reflect
capital expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (ii) they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements
for, working capital needs; (iii) they do not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on
debt; and (iv) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced
in the future and do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements. See “ Presentation of Financial and Other
_Information – Alternative performance measures (“APMs”)” and “ Risk Factors –Risks Relating to the Acquisition – Titan Group’s ability to operate_
_its business effectively may suffer if it is unable to cost-effectively establish its own administrative and other support functions in order to operate as a_
_standalone company after the expiration of the Transitional Services Agreement with the Crown Group.”_

The calculations for Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA are based on various assumptions, management estimates and unaudited
management accounts. These amounts have not been audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm. This information is inherently
subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or results of operations of the transactions
for the periods presented and may not be comparable to our combined financial statements or other financial information included in this Offering
Memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA because we believe they are helpful to investors as measures of our operating performance and ability to service our debt.

The following table provides a reconciliation of (i) net income to EBITDA, (ii) EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA and (iii) Adjusted EBITDA to Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the period indicated:

(a) This amount represents that portion of the historical costs and expenses of Crown assigned to Titan Group in the Audited Combined Financial
Statements and Unaudited Interim Condensed Combined Financial Statements using an allocation method primarily based on percentage of
sales, including expenses for executive management, finance, legal, information technology, employee benefit administration, treasury and risk
management as well as technology royalties.

(b) This amount represents the costs and expenses required to operate the Group on a standalone basis. These costs cover substantially the same
categories that comprise the amounts under “ Discontinued Corporate Allocations”. Standalone costs are expected to be significantly less than
costs incurred under the Discontinued Corporate Allocations. See “ Risk Factors — Risks Relating to the Acquisition — Titan Group’s ability to
_operate its business effectively may suffer if it is unable to cost-effectively establish its own administrative and other support functions in order_
_to operate as a standalone company after the expiration of the Transitional Services Agreement with the Crown Group.” Standalone costs are_
based on management estimates and assumptions (including the successful implementation of our standalone strategy) and are forward looking
in nature. As such, this information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in our estimates. Any failure by us to successfully execute on our standalone strategy could materially impact our results. As such,
this information is inherently subject to business, economic and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those contained in our estimated standalone costs and expenses. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial impact or
results of these actions and initiatives and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. If one or more of our underlying
assumptions proves to have been incorrect, this could lead to substantially higher costs than planned and we may not be able to realize fully, or
realize in the anticipated time frame, the estimated benefits from our standalone cost-savings. See "Risk Factors — Risks Relating to the
_Acquisition — Titan Group has no operating history as a standalone company and it may not be successful in implementing its strategy as a_
_standalone business."_

(c) Following the Completion Date, the Business will operate on a stand-alone basis independently of its United States parent. Given that none of
the Group’s operations are in the United States, we expect that our reporting currency will shift from the U.S. Dollar to the Euro and we anticipate
preparing our financial statements under IFRS. The amounts in this line item represent the estimated impact of operating lease expenses
recognized under IFRS 16, which introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees. The amounts in this line item represent
the U.S. GAAP operating lease expense from the Audited Combined Financial Statements as a proxy for the IFRS 16 lease liabilities. See Annex
A for a discussion of certain differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. A lessee recognizes a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the
underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligations to make lease payments. There are optional exemptions for short-term leases
and leases of low value items.

(d) This adjustment in the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily relates to a $25 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge, incurred related
primarily to our aerosols and promotional packaging activities, resulting from the outlook for tinplate aerosol packaging having declined and
operating costs in the aerosol and promotional packaging activities having increased, as well as an $8 million restructuring add-back and a $3
million loss on disposal. The adjustment in the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily relates to a $2 million gain on disposal. The Business
has undergone a variety of restructuring efforts, primarily related to plant closures in France and Germany in an effort to reduce overall fixed


-----

headcount and duplicative positions. Restructuring costs included in this adjustment take account of severance and other general cost associated
with implementing the restructuring such as cleaning or stripping plants.

(e) Represents the removal of non-operating costs included in pension expense, in particular amortization of prior year unrealized losses related to
German pensions.

(f) Represents costs associated with discontinued operations in Peru, primarily comprised of VAT expenses and operating losses. The facility in
Peru is not part of the Titan Group going forward.

(g) This amount normalizes the impact of bad debt expense to $1.1 million per annum based on historical bad debt expense accruals, run-rate and
relatively consistent sales year over year over a period of 10 years.

(h) Represents (i) expenses in relation to the implementation of a new information technology system in the year ended December 31, 2018 leading
to more precise methodologies in monitoring inventory, (ii) recoveries of customer claims from suppliers in relation to defective products, (iii)
removal of EBITDA relating to a customer contract which was discontinued in the year ended December 31, 2018, and (iv) normalizing costs
in relation to the Business’ UK pension system due to a change from a defined benefit plan to a defined contribution plan in the year ended
December 31, 2019.

(i) Our Adjusted EBITDA margin amounted to 13.5%, 11.6%, 12.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, and
8.5% and 14.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.

(j) This amount represents estimated savings expected to be realized in connection with procurement initiatives for raw materials, in particular
tinplate through, inter alia, negotiation of price discounts in place of long payment terms and intensifying cross-functional cooperation to
harmonize specifications of raw materials. Pro forma procurement savings are based on management estimates and assumptions (including the
successful implementation of certain initiatives) and are forward-looking in nature. As such, this information is inherently subject to risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our estimates. Any failure by us to successfully execute
on our strategy to achieve procurement efficiencies could materially impact our results. See “ Risk Factors – Titan Group has no operating
_history as a standalone company and it may not be successful in implementing its strategy as a standalone business.”_

(k) Not meaningful.

(2) Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA divided by net sales.

(3) Capital expenditure includes both maintenance and growth capital expenditure. In the years ended December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2020, growth
capital expenditure represented on average approximately 10% of capital expenditures.

(4) Free cash flow represents Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures.

(5) Cash conversion represents free cash flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA.

(6) Volumes represents the number of units sold of food cans only.

(7) Pro forma net debt represents our net debt on a pro forma basis for the Transaction, including an aggregate of €375 million under the Notes offered
hereby. See “ Capitalization.” Pro forma net debt is presented for illustrative purposes only and is based on a convenience translation of Euro to US
Dollar of 1:1.1728.

(8) Pro forma net secured debt represents the Term Loan B Facility net of pro forma cash and cash equivalents. See “Capitalization.” Pro forma net
secured debt is presented for illustrative purposes only and is based on a convenience translation of Euro to US Dollar of 1:1.1728.

(9) Pro forma cash interest expense represents cash pay interest payable under the Credit Facilities Agreement (including the Term Loan B Facility but
not including the Revolving Credit Facility) and the cash pay interest payable in respect of the Notes as if the Transaction had occurred on April 1,
2020. This amount does not include any interest on lease liabilities, or any commitment or utilization fees associated with the Senior Facilities
Agreement and assumes an imputed weighted average interest rate for the Term Loan B Facility. Pro forma cash interest expense is presented for
illustrative purposes only and is based on a convenience translation of Euro to US Dollar of 1:1.162.

The Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Condensed Combined Financial Statements included
in this Offering Memorandum are based on U.S. GAAP, which differs in certain respects from IFRS. For a discussion of certain
significant differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS, see Annex A. Management has undertaken a preliminary analysis to
assess the potential impact on the Group’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows from a change from U.S.
GAAP to IFRS. Management has determined that the application of IFRS 16 is expected to impact the Group's treatment of
leases, in particular with respect to the income statement. For the estimated impact of the application of IFRS 16 on the Group's
Adjusted EBITDA, see “Summary Financial and Other Information.” While Management believes that the application of IFRS
16 will be the main impact to the Group’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows as a result of the change from
U.S. GAAP to IFRS, the Group has not prepared and is not presenting a reconciliation of the Audited Combined Financial
Statements and the Unaudited Interim Combined Consolidated Financial Statements to IFRS in this Offering Memorandum,
and it is possible that such a change could lead to other differences to the Group’s financial position, results of operations and
cash flows from the amounts presented in this Offering Memorandum. See “Risk Factors – The Financial Statements are based


-----

_on U.S. GAAP and there may be differences between our financial position and results of operations prepared in accordance_
_with U.S. GAAP and IFRS. In addition, should Titan Group decide to adopt IFRS as its accounting reporting method, this could_
_potentially result in material changes to certain of its financial information from the information presented in this Offering_
_Memorandum.”_
Following the Completion Date, the Business will no longer be part of the Crown Group and hence will be operated
independently from its United States parent. Given that none of the Group’s operations are in the United States, we expect that
our reporting currency will shift from the U.S. Dollar to the Euro, representing the functional currency in a majority of the
jurisdictions in which we operate. Therefore, we have included below a convenience translation into the Euro, based on the
exchange rates derived from Titan Group’s accounting systems or, in the case of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, the average
exchange rate for the twelve months period ended March 31, 2021 based on market observable rates, of the summary financial
data included above which is presented for illustrative purposes only. Footnotes to the tables have not been repeated or
separately translated into Euro. See “Presentation of Financial Information – Convenience Translation”.

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF**
**OPERATIONS**

_The following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition as of and for the years_
_ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, as derived from the Audited Combined Financial Statements and as of and for the_
_three-months periods ended March 31, 2020 and 2021 as derived from the Unaudited Interim Condensed Combined Financial_
_Statements. It covers periods prior to the consummation of the Acquisition; accordingly, the discussion and analysis of_
_historical periods does not reflect the significant impact that the Transactions will have on us. Certain monetary amounts,_
_percentages and other figures included in this Offering Memorandum have been subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly,_
_figures shown as totals in certain tables may not be the arithmetic aggregation of the figures that precede them, and figures_
_expressed as percentages in the text may not total 100% or, as applicable, when aggregated may not be the arithmetic_
_aggregation of the percentages that precede them._

_Unless the context indicates otherwise, in this section references to “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Group,” refer, to the_
_Titan Group comprising the Business._

_You should read this discussion in conjunction with the sections entitled “Presentation of Financial and Other_
_Information,” “Summary Financial Information and Other Data” and “Selected Financial Information” of this Offering_
_Memorandum._

_For the preparation of the Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Combined Financial_
_Statements it was necessary to make assumptions and estimates. Accordingly, the Audited Combined Financial Statements and_

_forward-looking statements._

**Overview**

We are a European leader in the design, manufacture and sale of metal packaging solutions, with number one or
number two market positions across our product groups in the countries we operate in. We are the clear market leader in the
26.7-billion-unit European market for metal food cans and ends, holding the number one market position with an approximate
39% market share based on volume in the year ended December 31, 2020. As the largest European manufacturer of metal food
cans and ends and the largest European buyer of tinplate steel (based on our estimated consumption of approximately 20% of
total European tinplate production), our business is a critical asset in the European food supply chain.

We have been in the industry for more than 200 years and have an established reputation for the highest quality
products and exceptional customer service. From the founding of our predecessor business in 1799 to our acquisition by Crown
in 1996 and our acquisition of Mivisa in 2014, our business has shown itself to be a leader in European metal packaging time
and time again. Following the Transactions, we will become a leading stand-alone business in Europe.

Our product portfolio consists predominantly of food packaging, with approximately 95% of our sales in the year
ended December 31, 2020 going to food related end markets. Our products are used by hundreds of millions of consumers on
a daily basis across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we produced approximately 12
billion food cans, approximately 24 billion ends, approximately 5.3 billion metal closures, approximately 581 million aerosol
cans and approximately 134 million metal promotional packaging containers. Our products are used to package food in a
diverse array of end-markets, including fruits and vegetables, tomatoes, fish, pet food, culinary, infant nutrition and dairy. Each
of our end-markets is driven by fundamental demand drivers that are stable and largely uncorrelated with broader
macroeconomic cycles.


-----

**Note: For the year ended December 31, 2020**
1. According to leading global consulting firm
2. According to Management estimates

We sell our products in more than 90 countries with France, Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy and Germany
representing 15%, 14%, 12%, 11% and 7% of our sales, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2020 and other
geographies making up the remaining 41% of sales in the same period. Sales to our top 10 customers represented just 32% of
our total sales in the year ended December 31, 2020. We benefit from long-standing relationships with our customers, having
worked with our top 10 customers for an average of over 25 years.

Our business is significantly insulated from raw material price fluctuation through a combination of formulaic and
negotiated raw material pass-through mechanisms, providing us with margin stability and consistent historical cash flows. We
have demonstrated our ability to pass through fluctuations in the prices of our raw material inputs over the long term. Moreover,
as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, Titan Group’s pass-through was on track for full recovery of raw material price
increases in 2021. Based on Management estimates, the vast majority of sales are covered by at least annual contracts, with up
to 40% of total sales secured on multi-year contracts. Our customer contracts provide sales volume visibility, as many contracts
stipulate a guaranteed percentage of total customer orders for the term of the contract.

We operate 44 strategically located manufacturing facilities (in addition to the Braunstone site, which will be
transferred at the end of the transition period) in 17 countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, which enhance our access
to customer end-markets and support local demand. Our manufacturing scale is complemented by our services and customer
support capabilities including over 20 technical services locations, seven dedicated product design studios, four dedicated
laboratory testing facilities and a world-class research and development facility that have put us at the forefront of the European
tinplate packaging industry.

In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, we had net sales of $2,241 million, $2,138 million and $2,227
million, respectively, and Adjusted EBITDA of $303 million, $247 million and $267 million, respectively. Our net sales and
Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA were $2,297 million and $317 million, respectively, for the twelve months ended March 31,
2021. These amounts translate, for convenience purposes only, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, to net
sales of €1,897 million, €1,910 million and €1,951 million, respectively, and Adjusted EBITDA of €256 million, €221 million
and €234 million, respectively, and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, to net sales and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
of €1,974 million and €272 million, respectively.

**Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations**

The following are a description of the main factors which have affected our financial condition and results of
operations for the three-months period ended March 31, 2020 and 2021 and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and
2020, as well as certain factors which are expected to impact our financial condition and results of operations in the future.

The businesses, operations, assets and liabilities comprising the Titan Group have historically operated as part and
under the umbrella of the global Crown Group, which provided substantial management and shared services to the business.
Upon completion of the Acquisition, Titan Group will operate on a standalone basis. We have no history operating as a
standalone group, see also “Risk Factors––We have no operating history as a standalone company.” Consequently, our future
results of operations will exclude cost historically allocated to Titan Group by Crown and will include costs and expenses for
us to operate as a standalone business, and we expect these costs and expenses to be materially different than our historical cost
structure. We will also incur a significant amount of debt in connection with the Transactions. Accordingly, our historical results
presented in this Offering Memorandum are not indicative of our future results of operations, financial positions and cash flows.


-----

**_COVID-19 and Macroeconomic Environment_**

In the year ended December 31, 2020 and the three months ended March 31, 2021, the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on production and aggregate demand became apparent in all economies. In leading global economies, authorities
enacted strong expansionary measures to provide income support to households and firms, provide credit to the economy and
bolster market liquidity. The spread of the virus in Europe since the end of February 2020 and the measures adopted to reduce
the rate of infection had significant repercussions on economic activity in the year ended December 31, 2020 and the three
months ended March 31, 2021. In relation to the Group, the COVID-19 pandemic generated a modest increase in canned food
consumption due to more at-home eating, which was partially offset by lower sales of large format cans for the food services
industry. In addition, demand for aerosols packaging declined as personal care habits changed during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Sales of promotional packaging also declined as marketplaces such as airport shops where such packaging is sold were closed.
Overall, we estimate that benefits due to increases in demand for food cans offset losses in volume in our aerosols and
promotional packaging activities and increased expenditures, resulting in a net neutral impact to our financial performance.

Our manufacturing facilities were deemed system relevant in each jurisdiction in which we operate and remained fully
operational throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Our office workforce experienced no disruption since the outbreak of the
COVID-19 pandemic due to our ability to swiftly switch all platforms and processes to be functional remotely and to promptly
enhance communication channels. Even before the restrictive measures in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic came into effect,
we adopted a series of further, voluntary and increasingly stringent precautionary measures in addition to those required by
law, with a view to ensuring a greater degree of protection for employees. We leveraged the use of smart working arrangements
for those activities that can be carried out remotely, and vacation and paid leave were incentivized. In addition, we took
advantage of social safety-net arrangements as appropriate, in conjunction with the introduction of anti-contagion safety
protocols, use of personal protection equipment and sanitization of business premises.

**_Seasonality_**

Demand for some of our products is seasonal. At least 45% of our revenue is generated from sales to seasonal food
end-markets. The industry enters its busiest period in the third quarter when the majority of seasonal fruits and vegetables are
harvested. Due to the foregoing factors our working capital requirements typically build during the first half of a financial year
and decrease during the second half of a financial year. Inventory levels typically increase in the first half of the year to meet
peak demand in the second and third quarters. Our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity may therefore be impacted by
these seasonal practices.

**_Weather Conditions_**

Weather conditions can reduce crop yields and adversely affect customer demand for fruit and vegetable cans in any
given year. In addition, demand for our seafood packaging is affected by variation in local fish catches. Severe weather
conditions associated with climate change such as droughts, hail, floods or frost, are unpredictable and may potentially impact
agricultural production which in turn may lead to reduced demand for our products in the regions in which we currently operate.
See also “Risk Factors––Titan Group's business is seasonal and adverse weather conditions could reduce Titan Group's net
_sales.”_

**_Raw Material Expenses_**

Raw materials constitute the substantial majority of our production cost and our total costs of raw materials were
$1,196 million, $1,148 million and $1,159 million, or 53.7%, 53.7% and 51.7%, respectively, of our net sales for the year ended
December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our key raw material input is steel (both tinplate and tin-free forms), which
constituted 48.5%, 51.2% and 49.2% of the total cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018,
respectively. We believe we are the largest purchaser of tinplate steel in Europe. Our relationships with domestic European
steel mills are a key strength of our business and represent a critical strategic advantage compared to our competitors. The cost
of steel is affected by a variety of micro and macro factors, primarily based on the supply and demand for steel, market
movements in other base metals and geopolitical factors. Importantly, steel is generally purchased under one-year contracts
with prices that are fixed for each calendar year, minimizing the intra-year volatility of our primary input cost.

We have not experienced any material supply issues related to our key raw materials that impacted our ability to meet
customer demand requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that our strong relationships with the leading
European suppliers of steel, including committed volume contracts, have allowed us to source steel consistently through a
variety of market conditions. We also believe that certain of our competitors are experiencing difficulties in purchasing these
raw materials because of a lack of scale. We centrally manage our procurement operations across the Group in order to achieve


-----

economies of scale, seek consistency across our relationships across Europe, the Middle East and Africa and provide more
certainty for production planning.

Changes in the cost of raw materials affect both our net sales and our cost of materials and thus substantially affect
our results of operations. However, the price for steel is not often a substantial factor affecting our underlying business
performance as we typically pass-through any increases in raw material prices to our customers. Through a combination of
contracts which include input cost pass-through provisions and annual price negotiations which also reflect tinplate prices, we
have historically been able to minimize margin volatility due to changes in raw material costs. We pass through changes in raw
material costs relating to the remainder of our business’s revenues through annual pricing negotiations. Since steel prices are
also contracted for on an annual basis, our customer pricing and raw material input cost changes are generally matched. We
have been generally able to successfully pass through raw material price fluctuations and maintain largely consistent margins
throughout much of our operating history. However, in 2019, Titan offered certain price concessions to capture wallet share
and long long-term contracts. This improved revenue certainty at the expense of short short-term margins.

**_Foreign Exchange Transactions_**

During the periods discussed herein, our reporting currency was the U.S. Dollar, however our sales and revenue and
operating costs are realized in other currencies, predominantly the Euro, which represents approximately 74% of our revenue.
As a result, our historical financials are exposed to foreign exchange translation fluctuations between such other currencies and
the U.S. Dollar. The translation of foreign currencies back to the U.S. Dollar may have a significant impact on our revenues
and financial results. Foreign exchange has an unfavorable impact on revenues when the U.S. Dollar is relatively strong as
compared with foreign currencies and a favorable impact on revenues when the U.S. Dollar is relatively weak as compared
with foreign currencies.

Our business has a limited level of transactional currency exposure arising from sales or purchases by operating
activities in currencies other than their functional currencies.

Assets and liabilities of the Group denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, were translated to U.S. Dollar
using the applicable period-end rates of exchange. To counteract seasonal effects, the income, expense and cash flow items
were translated to U.S. Dollar at average exchange rates prevailing throughout the applicable period. Translation adjustments
are accumulated as a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss).

Following the Completion Date, the Business will no longer be part of the Crown Group and hence will be operated
independently from its United States parent. Given that none of the Group’s operations are in the United States, we expect that
our reporting currency will shift from the U.S. Dollar to the Euro, representing the functional currency in a majority of the
jurisdictions in which we operate. While we will remain subject to limited foreign exchange transaction risk, such shift would
eliminate the risk arising from currency translation to the U.S. Dollar. We expect this change in reporting currency to have a
positive impact on the stability and comparability of our results of operations going forward.

**_Sustainability_**

Steel and aluminum packaging is environmentally sustainable. Not only are steel and aluminum infinitely recyclable,
but they also have the highest recycling rates amongst packaging formats. Additionally, according to the Can Manufacturing
Institute, recycling saves up to 75% of the energy required to produce virgin steel. Greater environmental consciousness and
strong sustainability trends have led to an increased preference for recyclable packaging. Consumers increasingly view
sustainability as a key purchasing criteria and seek out more environmentally friendly packaging, which has been further
reinforced by regulatory developments. Changes in regulations and ability to reuse materials and produce packaging that is
perceived as environmentally friendly can affect both our net sales and our cost of materials and thus substantially affect our
results of operations. Metal packaging’s properties position it to benefit from the increasing backlash against the use of plastic
products.

**Description of Key Components of Our Income Statement**

**_Net Sales_**

Net sales consist of gross sales less sales adjustments related to provisions for customer returns, allowances, rebates,
pass-through taxes and eliminations of intra-group transactions. We disaggregate net sales based on the timing of transfer of
control for goods and services. The transfer of control for goods and services may occur at a point in time or over time; in other


-----

words, sales may be recognized over the course of the underlying contract, or they may occur at a single point in time based
upon the transfer of control.

**_Cost of Products Sold_**

Costs of products sold includes fixed and variable production costs. Such variable costs mainly consist of the costs of
raw materials, realized effective hedges related to commodity hedges, unrealized and realized ineffective hedges related to
commodity hedges, energy, freight, utilities, handling and conversion costs, waste disposal, consumables, attributable
depreciation charges and directly attributable overhead expenses, including wages and salaries and overhead expenses that are
attributable to production. Due to the seasonal demand of our business, we utilize temporary labor to scale production to meet
customer demand. Changes in variable costs relating to raw material prices are generally passed through to customers. Fixed
costs include a portion of overhead labor costs, as well as rent, impairment of inventories, repairs and maintenance.

**_Depreciation and Amortization_**

Depreciation and amortization relates to the depreciation of property, plant and equipment and the amortization of
intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
assets. The Group periodically reviews the estimated useful lives of its plant, property and equipment and, where appropriate,
changes are made prospectively. Definite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when facts and circumstances
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable from their undiscounted cash flows.

**_Selling and Administrative Expenses_**

Selling expenses include all selling costs. During the periods presented herein, Selling costs comprise the sales and
customer service activities of the organization. Administrative expenses typically include advertising costs, insurance costs,
legal and professional fees, office supplies, design and development cost, sales and marketing costs, finance costs, information
technology, human resources and other administrative costs.

As from the Closing Date, certain allocated administrative expenses of our current United States parent will not
continue, while some allocated charges will need to be replicated by costs going forward. Please refer to the reconciliation of
Adjusted EBITDA included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum for further detail. See “Summary Financial and Other
_Information.”_

**_Technology Royalty_**

Technology royalty refers to an intragroup charge to Crown for general research and development and overall business
processes for the periods presented herein. From the Closing Date onwards, this charge to Crown will discontinue.

**_Restructuring and Other_**

Restructuring costs relate to reduction of manufacturing capacity and headcount across the Group. Other relates to
asset impairments and gains on the sale of assets.

**_Goodwill Impairment_**

Goodwill impairment relates to impairment charges where an asset’s carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.
Goodwill is carried at cost and reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year or when facts and
circumstances indicate goodwill may be impaired.

**_Interest Expense and Other Expenses_**

Interest expense relates to interest expenses from our intragroup and external financings including bank borrowings,
interest expense associated with accounts receivable factoring and securitization programs, trade bills and other financial
expenses. Other expenses relates to pension and related non-services costs as well as foreign exchange gains or losses.


-----

**_Provision for Income Taxes_**

Income tax expenses consist of current tax expense and deferred tax expense. Deferred taxes represent the future
expected tax consequences of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities based upon
enacted tax rates and laws. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that
a tax benefit will not be realized. Investment tax credits are accounted for using the deferral method. Income tax-related interest
and penalties are reported as income tax expense.

The Group’s effective tax rate (calculated as income taxes divided by income before income taxes) was 27.9% for the
year ended December 31, 2020, 30.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019, and 24.0% for the year ended December 31,
2018. The Group’s effective income tax rate fluctuates based on, among other factors, the geographic mix of earnings. The
higher effective income tax rate in 2019 is related to a $25 million non-deductible impairment charge primarily related to our
aerosols and promotional packaging activities.

**_Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests_**

We consolidate entities in which we own or control more than fifty percent of voting shares or otherwise have a
controlling financial interest in the entity. We consider ourselves to have a controlling financial interest in the entity if we have
(1) the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and (2) the
obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the entity or the right to receive benefits from
the entity that could potentially be significant to the entity.

The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests refers to the share of profit belonging to the minority
shareholders of the entity which is controlled by the Group, but for which only a portion of earnings are returned to the Group.
The portion returned reflects the percentage of entity ownership. In this case, the Group’s line item represents the share of
profit belonging to the minority shareholders of the Group.

**Alternative Performance Measures (“APMs”)**

Below is a discussion of certain non-US GAAP financial information. Such financial information is not defined under
US GAAP, and other companies may calculate such financial information differently or may use such measures for different
purposes, limiting the usefulness of such measures as comparative measures. The APMs should not be considered in isolation
and investors should not consider such information as alternative to net income as an indicator of our financial performance,
an alternative to income from operations as an indicator of our operating performance, or an alternative to cash flows from
operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Such financial information must be considered only in addition to, and not as
a substitute for or superior to, financial information prepared in accordance with US GAAP included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these APMs and are also advised to review them in
conjunction with the Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Condensed Combined Financial
Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

This Offering Memorandum contains financial measures that are not defined or recognized under US GAAP,
including: EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA margin. We present these APMs because we believe that they contribute to a better understanding of our results of
operations by providing additional information on what we consider some of the drivers of our financial performance.
Furthermore, we believe that these APMs are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties
as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity.

In addition, the presentation of these measures is not intended to and does not necessarily comply with the reporting
requirements of the SEC; compliance with its requirements would require us to make changes to the presentation of this
information. We believe that the description of these APMs in this Offering Memorandum follows and complies with the
European Securities and Markets Authority Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures dated October 5, 2015.

See also “Presentation of Financial Information––Alternative performance measures (“APMs”).”

**_EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin_**

We calculate EBITDA as net income before provision of income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization.
EBITDA is not a measurement of performance under US GAAP and investors should not consider EBITDA as an alternative


-----

to income from operations as an indicator of our operating performance, or an alternative to cash flow from operating activities
as a measure of our liquidity.

We calculate Adjusted EBITDA by applying adjustments for non-operating or non-recurring items to EBITDA. We
calculate Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA by applying adjustments for the benefit of cost savings from operational improvement
opportunities that we expect to realize within the next three years. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA
divided by net sales.

We believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are meaningful for investors because they
provide an analysis of our operating results, profitability and ability to service debt and because they are used by our chief
operating decision makers to track our business evolution, establish operational and strategic targets and make important
business decisions. To facilitate the analysis of our operations, EBITDA excludes amortization, impairment and depreciation
expenses from income from operations in order to eliminate the impact of general long term capital investment.

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to our net income for the periods
discussed herein.

(1) This amount represents that portion of the historical costs and expenses of Crown assigned to Titan Group in the Audited Combined Financial
Statements and Unaudited Interim Condensed Combined Financial Statements using an allocation method primarily based on percentage of sales,
including expenses for executive management, finance, legal, information technology, employee benefit administration, treasury and risk
management as well as technology royalties.

(2) This amount represents the costs and expenses required to operate the Group on a standalone basis. These costs cover substantially the same
categories that comprise the amounts under “ Discontinued Corporate Allocations”. Standalone costs are expected to be significantly less than costs
incurred under the Discontinued Corporate Allocations. See “ Risk Factors — Risks Relating to the Acquisition — Titan Group’s ability to operate
_its business effectively may suffer if it is unable to cost-effectively establish its own administrative and other support functions in order to operate_
_as a standalone company after the expiration of the Transitional Services Agreement with the Crown Group.” Standalone costs are based on_
management estimates and assumptions (including the successful implementation of our standalone strategy) and are forward looking in nature. As
such, this information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our
estimates. Any failure by us to successfully execute on our standalone strategy could materially impact our results. As such, this information is
inherently subject to business, economic and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained


-----

in our estimated standalone costs and expenses. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial impact or results of these actions
and initiatives and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. If one or more of our underlying assumptions proves to have
been incorrect, this could lead to substantially higher costs than planned and we may not be able to realize fully, or realize in the anticipated time
frame, the estimated benefits from our standalone cost-savings. See "Risk Factors — Risks Relating to the Acquisition — Titan Group has no
_operating history as a standalone company and it may not be successful in implementing its strategy as a standalone business."_

(3) Following the Completion Date, the Business will operate on a stand-alone basis independently of its United States parent. Given that none of the
Group’s operations are in the United States, we expect that our reporting currency will shift from the U.S. Dollar to the Euro and we anticipate
preparing our financial statements under IFRS. The amounts in this line item represent the estimated impact of operating lease expenses recognized
under IFRS 16, which introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees. The amounts in this line item represent the U.S.
GAAP operating lease expense from the Audited Combined Financial Statements as a proxy for the IFRS 16 lease liabilities. See Annex A for a
discussion of certain differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. A lessee recognizes a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying
asset and a lease liability representing its obligations to make lease payments. There are optional exemptions for short-term leases and leases of
low value items.

(4) This adjustment in the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily relates to a $25 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge, incurred related
primarily to our aerosols and promotional packaging activities, resulting from the outlook for tinplate aerosol packaging having declined and
operating costs in the aerosol and promotional packaging activities having increased, as well as an $8 million restructuring add-back and a $3
million loss on disposal. The adjustment in the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily relates to a $2 million gain on disposal. The Business has
undergone a variety of restructuring efforts, primarily related to plant closures in France and Germany in an effort to reduce overall fixed headcount
and duplicative positions. Restructuring costs included in this adjustment take account of severance and other general cost associated with
implementing the restructuring such as cleaning or stripping plants.

(5) Represents the removal of non-operating costs included in pension expense, in particular amortization of prior year unrealized losses related to
German pensions.

(6) Represents costs associated with discontinued operations in Peru, primarily comprised of VAT expenses and operating losses. The facility in Peru
is not part of the Titan Group going forward.

(7) This amount normalizes the impact of bad debt expense to $1.1 million per annum based on historical bad debt expense accruals, run-rate and
relatively consistent sales year over year over a period of 10 years.

(8) Represents (i) expenses in relation to the implementation of a new information technology system in the year ended December 31, 2018 leading to
more precise methodologies in monitoring inventory, (ii) recoveries of customer claims from suppliers in relation to defective products, (iii) removal
of EBITDA relating to a customer contract which was discontinued in the year ended December 31, 2018, and (iv) normalizing costs in relation to
the Business’ UK pension system due to a change from a defined benefit plan to a defined contribution plan in the year ended December 31, 2019.

(9) Our Adjusted EBITDA margin amounted to 13.5%, 11.6%, 12.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, and 8.5%
and 14.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve months ended
March 31, 2021 was $317 million. Please see “ Summary Financial and Other Information.” This amount includes estimated savings expected to
be realized in connection with procurement initiatives for raw materials, in particular tinplate through, inter alia, negotiation of price discounts in
place of long payment terms and intensifying cross-functional cooperation to harmonize specifications of raw materials. Pro forma procurement
savings are based on management estimates and assumptions (including the successful implementation of certain initiatives) and are forwardlooking in nature. As such, this information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from
those contained in our estimates. Any failure by us to successfully execute on our strategy to achieve procurement efficiencies could materially
impact our results. See “ Risk Factors – Titan Group has no operating history as a standalone company and it may not be successful in implementing
_its strategy as a standalone business.”_

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest ................................................... — (1) —

**Net income attributable to the Group....................................................................** **9** **34** **277.8%**

_Net sales_

Our net sales increased by $70 million, or 15.2%, to $530 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 from
$460 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to higher sales volume in the seasonal
foods end markets, including fruits and vegetables, with food can volumes increasing 8.5% for the three months ended March
31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020, in light of suppressed volumes for the three months ended
March 31, 2020 during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, which have normalized for the three months ended March
31, 2021. These trends were offset by lower sales volume in the fish end market for the three months ended March 31, 2021.

_Costs of products sold_

Costs of products sold increased by $38 million, or 9.6%, to $434 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021
from $396 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. Our costs of products sold as a percentage of net sales decreased
by 4.2 percentage points to 81.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2021 from 86.1% for the three months ended March
31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to an inventory pricing headwind in the three months ended March 31, 2020 caused
by a weaker than expected harvest in 2019 which did not repeat in the three months ended March 31, 2021.

_Depreciation and amortization_

Depreciation and amortization increased by $1 million, or 7.1%, to $15 million for the three months ended March 31,
2021 from $14 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, largely as a result of foreign currency translation, with the
Euro appreciating by 9.4% compared to the same period of the prior year.


-----

_Selling and administrative expenses_

Selling and administrative expenses increased by $1 million, or 3.8%, to $27 million for the three months ended March
31, 2021 from $26 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, largely due to foreign currency translation. The
underlying selling and administrative expenses in the operating currencies were lower in the three months ended March 31,
2021 than in the same period of the prior year.

_Technology royalty_

Technology royalty increased by $1 million, or 20.0%, to $6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 from
$5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, largely due to the increase in sales and associated increased cost
allocation. These expenses will not continue to be charged from Crown to the Business following the Completion Date.

_Restructuring and other_

We incurred $1 million of restructuring and other costs in the three months ended March 31, 2020 which were
primarily related to a loss on disposal of certain assets. We did not incur any such costs in the three months ended March 31,
2021.

_Income from operations_

Income from operations increased by $30 million, or 166.7%, to $48 million for the three months ended March 31,
2021 from $18 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, largely due to higher sales, lower cost of products sold,
lower selling and administrative expenses and foreign currency translation impact.

_Interest expense_

Interest expense increased by $1 million, or 100%, to $2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 from $1
million for the three months ended March 31, 2020.

_Provision for income taxes_

Provision for income taxes increased by $4 million, or 66.7%, to $10 million for the three months ended March 31,
2021, from $6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, largely due to higher income from operations.

_Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests_

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests amounted to $1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021,
primarily attributable to increased income in our Morocco business due to an increase in volume from a rebound in the fishing
industry, partially offset by foreign exchange impact. We reported no net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the
three months ended March 31, 2020.

_Net sales_

Our net sales increased by $89 million, or 4.2%, to $2,227 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $2,138
million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to higher sales unit volumes, with food can
volumes increasing 7.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 relative to the prior year due to increased sales of smaller
format cans, a better harvest relative to the prior year, as well as a positive impact of foreign currency translation. These impacts
were partially offset by the pass-through of lower raw material costs, as changes in raw material costs impact revenue levels
by a corresponding amount when they are passed through.

_Costs of products sold_

Costs of products sold increased by $62 million, or 3.4%, to $1,867 million for the year ended December 31, 2020
from $1,805 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales decreased
by 0.6 percentage points to 83.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 84.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
This decrease was primarily due to operating cost reductions as a result of our continuous improvement initiatives.

_Depreciation and amortization_

Depreciation and amortization were effectively flat year-over-year, increasing $1 million, or 1.7% to $59 million for
the year ended December 31, 2020 from $58 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, largely as a result of foreign
currency translation, with the Euro appreciating by 1.9% compared to the prior year period.


-----

_Selling and administrative expenses_

Selling and administrative expenses increased by $7 million, or 6.7%, to $112 million for the year ended December
31, 2020 from $105 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, largely due to higher sales expense from increased net
sales, as well as the impact of foreign currency translation.

_Technology royalty_

Technology royalty decreased by $2 million, or 7.1%, to $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $28
million for the year ended December 31, 2019, largely due to the change in type of sales by country and associated change in
allocation. These expenses will not continue to be charged from Crown to the Business following the Completion Date.

_Restructuring and other_

Restructuring and other costs decreased by $3 million, or 60.0%, to $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020
from $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Restructuring costs in each year related to headcount reductions at
certain facilities. In the year ended December 31, 2019, these costs were partially offset by gains on the sale of various assets
across the Group’s operations.

_Goodwill impairment_

We recorded no goodwill impairment in the year ended December 31, 2020, whereas we recorded $25 million goodwill
impairment in the year ended December 31, 2019 related primarily to our aerosols and promotional packaging activities. Please
refer to the comparison of results for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 for additional detail on this goodwill
impairment.

_Income from operations_

Income from operations increased by $49 million, or 43.8%, to $161 million for the year ended December 31, 2020
from $112 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher sales volume and the one time goodwill
impairment charge that only impacted the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Interest expense_

Interest expense was stable at $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December
31, 2019.

_Provision for income taxes_

Provision for income taxes increased by $10 million, or 32.3%, to $41 million for the year ended December 31, 2020,
from $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as the goodwill impairment charge did not recur in the year December
31, 2020.

_Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests_

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by $1 million, or 50.0%, to $1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020, from $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by lower income in our Morocco
business due to a decrease in volume from a temporary downturn in the fishing industry.

_Net sales_

Our net sales decreased by $103 million, or 4.6%, to $2,138 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from
$2,241 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of foreign currency
translation and lower sales volume due to lower crop yields with food can volumes increasing only 1.4% for the year ended
December 31, 2019 relative to the prior year, partially offset by the pass-through of higher raw material costs. Moreover, we
granted price concessions to certain customers in the year ended December 31, 2019, which led to lower net sales in that year
but to increased volumes over the long-term.

_Cost of products sold_

Costs of products sold decreased by $38 million, or 2.1%, to $1,805 million for the year ended December 31, 2019
from $1,843 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales increased by
2.2 percentage points to 84.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 82.2% for the year ended December 31, 2018. This
increase was primarily due to increased raw material costs, including tinplate steel and other non-metal raw materials, as well
as increases in labour, energy and freight and other costs, offset by operating cost reductions as a result of our continuous
improvement initiatives. Management decided not to pass-through the increased raw material costs to customers in an effort to
gain market share.

_Depreciation and amortization_

Depreciation and amortization were effectively flat at $58 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 relative to
$60 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.


-----

_Selling and administrative expenses_

Selling and administrative expenses decreased by $6 million, or 5.4%, to $105 million for the year ended December
31, 2019 from $111 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, largely due to lower selling expenses associated with lower
sales volumes, as well as cost saving initiatives implemented in the year.

_Technology royalty_

Technology royalty increased by $2 million, or 7.7%, to $28 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $26
million for the year ended December 31, 2018 largely due to the change in type of sales by country and associated change in
allocation. These expenses will not continue to be charged from Crown to the Business following the Completion Date.

_Restructuring and other_

Restructuring and other costs increased by $9 million to a cost of $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019
from gains of $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which were due to the sale of two food can facilities in the
United Kingdom which more than offset restructuring costs associated with headcount reductions.

_Goodwill impairment_

We recorded no goodwill impairment in the year ended December 31, 2018, whereas we recorded a $25 million noncash goodwill impairment charge in the year ended December 31, 2019 related to our aerosols and promotional packaging
activities, resulting from a determination that fair value had declined below its carrying value due to the outlook for tinplate
steel aerosol packaging having declined and operating costs in the aerosol and promotional packaging activities having
increased.

_Income from operations_

Income from operations decreased by $93 million, or 45.4%, to $112 million for the year ended December 31, 2019
from $205 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to reduced sales and a goodwill impairment charge
incurred in the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Interest expense_

Interest expense decreased by $2 million, or 18.2%, to $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $11
million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

_Provision for income taxes_

Provision for income taxes decreased by $13 million, or 29.5%, to $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2019,
from $44 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, largely due to reduced income from operations.

_Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests_

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased by $1 million, or 100.0%, to $2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019, from $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily driven by higher income in our Morocco
business due to an increase in volume, partially offset by an accounting adjustment in post-retirement benefits and foreign
exchange impact.

_Three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to three months ended March 31, 2020_

Our net cash used for operating activities was $183 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021, representing a
decrease of $25 million compared to the prior year, primarily attributable to higher sales volume and improved profitability.

Our net cash used in investing activities was $11 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021, representing an
increase of $8 million compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily attributable to capital expenditures
relating to the development of a new facility in Russia and improvement of existing manufacturing capabilities.

Our net cash provided by financing activities was $193 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared
to $202 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily attributable to intercompany loans from Crown.


-----

_Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019_

Our net cash generated by operating activities was $184 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, representing
an increase of $33 million compared to the prior year. The increase in cash generated by operating activities was primarily
driven by improved working capital management, particularly our ability to reduce inventory.

Our net cash used in investing activities was $31 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, representing a decrease
of $6 million compared to the prior year, primarily attributable to a decrease in capital expenditures, partially offset by sales of
assets and equipment.

Our net cash used in financing activities was $150 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, representing a
decrease of $127 million compared to the prior year, primarily attributable to a reduction in our regular cash transfers to Crown.

_Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018_

Our net cash generated by operating activities was $151 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a
decrease of $79 million compared to the prior year. The decrease in cash generated by operating activities was primarily related
to lower cash generated from net working capital in the year, as well as the lower profit generated in 2019 relative to prior year.

Our net cash used in investing activities was $37 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an
increase of $10 million compared to the prior year, primarily attributable to an increase in capital expenditures, partially offset
by sales of assets and equipment.

Our net cash used in financing activities was $277 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an
increase of $86 million compared to the prior year, primarily attributable to an increase in our regular cash transfers to Crown.

**_Liquidity_**

Before entering into the Financing, the primary sources of liquidity for our business have been cash flow from
operating activities and the existing revolving credit facilities of the Crown Group. Following completion of the Financing, we
expect that our primary source of liquidity will be cash flows from operating activities and the Revolving Credit Facility. It is
expected that, as of the Completion Date, the Revolving Credit Facility will be undrawn except that in the event that freely
available cash on the balance sheet on or about the Completion Date is lower than our estimate or insufficient to support our
working capital requirements due to, among other things, a negative movement in working capital, we may draw down amounts
under the Revolving Credit Facility on the Completion Date or shortly thereafter.

We have used our cash flow to fund operating expenses, working capital, capital expenditures, and capital and interest
payments related to our debt obligations. Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operations together with
available borrowings and cash on hand, will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity and debt service needs, we cannot
assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future debt and equity financing will be
available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes offered hereby, or to fund
our other liquidity needs.

We believe that the potential risks to our liquidity include:

   - a reduction in operating cash flows due to a lowering of operating profit from our operations, which could be caused
by a downturn in our performance, the industry as a whole or the economy as a whole;

   - the failure or delay of our customers to make payments due to us;

   - the failure to maintain low working capital requirements; and

  - the need to fund expansion and other development capital expenditures.

   - If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under the Revolving Credit
Facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

   - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;

   - sell our assets;

   - obtain additional debt or equity financing; and/or

   - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.


-----

We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory
terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of the Notes and any future debt may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives.

**Working Capital**

Our working capital follows a seasonal pattern, and is generally at its highest seasonal peak in the first half of each
year as working capital builds in advance of the highest sales experienced in the third quarter of each year. See “—Key Factors
_Affecting Our Results of Operations—Seasonality.” Changes in working capital are primarily due to the timing of our inventory_
build and raw material purchases relative to our customer sales and associated collections.

**Changes in working capital ..............................................................** **39** **(1)** **34** **(231)** **(242)**

Changes in working capital are measured as the changes in assets and liabilities in a period, as presented in our
combined statement of cash flows in the Audited Combined Financial Statements and our Unaudited Interim Condensed
Combined Financial Statements. For the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 and the years ended December 31,
2020, 2019 and 2018, our movements in net working capital were $(242) million, $(231) million, $34 million, $(1) million and
$39 million, respectively. The increase in working capital spend from the three months ended March 31, 2020 to the three
months ended March 31, 2021 was primarily due to an increase in inventory net of increase in trade payables. The decrease in
working capital spend from the year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2020 was a result of a reduction
in inventory offset by an increase in trade and other receivables. The slight increase in working capital spend from the year
ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2019 was a result of an increase in inventory offset by an increase
in trade and other payables.

We anticipate that our working capital requirements in the foreseeable future will generally be stable as a percentage
of net sales. We also manage our working capital using a number of accounts receivable financing programs. See “Off Balance
_Sheet Arrangements” below. However, these requirements can fluctuate for a variety of factors, including any significant_
increase in receivables due to longer time periods to collect payment from our customers or a substantial increase in the cost
of our raw materials.

In addition, Titan Group is party to several supply chain financing arrangements, in which a financial institution fulfils our
suppliers’ trade receivables on our behalf and we benefit from extended payment terms. In connection with the Acquisition, we
expect that certain of these financing arrangements representing an amount of approximately $124 million as of March 31,
2021 of accounts payable extensions will be discontinued. This may temporarily impact our net working capital and liquidity
positions, in which case we may draw down amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility to cover any amounts in excess of
internally generated cash flows and cash available on balance sheet. See "Risk Factors — Risks Relating to the Acquisition —
_We are exposed to risks related to our supplier financing arrangements which may terminate at completion or shortly following_
_the Acquisition.”_

**Capital Expenditures**

Capital expenditures for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 and the years ended December 31, 2020,
2019 and 2018 amounted to $11 million, $3 million, $33 million (including $2 million growth capital expenditures), $41 million
(including $7 million growth capital expenditures), $24 million, respectively. We define capital expenditures as consisting
primarily of expenditure on property, plant and equipment. This includes expenditure on new manufacturing plants and
expansion of existing plant capacity for new production lines, maintenance capital expenditure comprising expenditures on


-----

maintenance of machinery and buildings, improvements of existing plants, and improvements to the health and safety
conditions at our facilities.

From 2018 to 2020, we invested $98 million in total capital expenditures, of which approximately $9 million was in
growth projects. Our historical capital expenditure requirements have been focused on maintaining our existing asset base and
improving the health and safety conditions at our facilities. However, there have been several recent growth investments
including a new PVC-Free Closure Line, which supports above market growth of PVC Free closures and positions us for highly
competitive supply to market.

Our estimated capital expenditure budget for the year ended December 31, 2021 is similar to our capital expenditure
in the year ended December 31, 2020. We expect that our capital expenditure (including both maintenance and growth capital
expenditure) will increase modestly in the near term as we seek to re-allocate capital to margin accretive strategic investments.
We have a fully developed capital plan with numerous projects that have payback periods of approximately three years.

**Contractual Obligations**

We have contractual commitments providing for payments primarily pursuant to our outstanding financial debt,
including the financial obligations arising from the Notes.

Our consolidated contractual obligations as of March 31, 2021, after giving pro forma effect to the Offering, were as
follows:


**More than**

**5 years**


**Total**


**Less than**

**1 year** **1–5 years**

**Total Contractual Obligations** [(4)] ............................................................... **2,817** **920** **75** **1,822**

(1) These purchase commitments specify significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable pricing
provisions; and the approximate timing of transactions.
(2) Long-term debt represents the principal under the Term Loan B Facility and the Notes and is presented based on a convenience translation of Euro to
US Dollar of 1:1.1728. Long-term debt does not include any interest on long-term debt.
(3) Pension projections require the use of numerous estimates and assumptions such as discount rates, rates of return on plan assets, compensation
increases, health care cost increases, mortality and employee turnover and therefore projected contributions been provided for only five years.
(4) Total Contractual Obligations does not include any interest on long-term debt.

**Employee Pensions**

In accordance with the laws and practices in each of the countries in which we operate, we participate in, or operate,
benefit plans providing for the payment of post-employment benefits (including retirement benefits) to eligible current and
former employees, retirees and their beneficiaries. Virtually all of our employees are entitled to pension benefits.

**Off Balance Sheet Arrangements**

The Group utilizes receivables securitization and factoring facilities in the normal course of business as part of
managing its cash flows. The factoring programs rely on the creditworthiness of the Group’s customers and not the Group
itself. KPS and Titan are in advanced discussions with all of the Company’s factoring counterparties and substantially all have
committed to continue their existing programs with Titan on a standalone basis.

The Group accounts for transfers under its securitization facilities as sales because the Group sells full title and
ownership in the underlying receivables and has met the criteria for control of the receivables to be considered transferred. As
of March 31, 2021, March 31, 2020, December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the amount outstanding
under our securitization arrangements, all of which were non-recourse, was $140 million, $119 million, $129 million, $125
million and $115 million, respectively.


-----

The Group accounts for its factoring arrangements as either sales or secured borrowing based on whether it has
transferred control over the factored receivables. The Group’s continuing involvement in factored receivables accounted for as
sales is limited to servicing the receivables. The Group receives adequate compensation for servicing the receivables and no
servicing asset or liability is recorded. As of March 31, 2021, March 31, 2020, December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and
December 31, 2018, the amount outstanding under our factoring arrangements, almost all of which were non-recourse, was
$242 million (of which $7 million was related to recourse factoring arrangements), $225 million (of which $5 million was
related to recourse factoring arrangements), $324 million (of which $17 million was related to recourse factoring arrangements),
$310 million (of which $14 million was related to recourse factoring arrangements) and $304 million (of which $9 million was
related to recourse factoring arrangements), respectively.

At December 31, amounts securitized or factored were as follows:

**As of the year ended December 31,**

**2018** **2019** **2020**
_(in $ millions)_
**Audited**
Accounted for as sales ......................................................................... 410 421 436

The Company recorded expenses related to factoring facilities of $8 million, $8 million and $10 million in the years ended
December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

**Environmental Matters**

Compliance with the Group’s Environmental Protection Policy is mandatory and the responsibility of each employee
of the Group. The Group is committed to the protection of human health and the environment and is operating within the
increasingly complex laws and regulations of national, state and local environmental agencies or is taking action to achieve
compliance with such laws and regulations. Environmental considerations are among the criteria by which the Group evaluates
projects, products, processes and purchases. The Group is dedicated to a long-term environmental protection program and has
indicated and implemented many pollution prevention programs with an emphasis on source reduction. The Group continues
to reduce the amount of metal used in the manufacture of containers through “lightweighting” programs. The Group recycles
nearly 100% of scrap aluminum, steel and copper used in its manufacturing processes. Many of the Group’s programs for
pollution prevention reduce operating costs and improve operating efficiencies.

The potential impact on the Group’s operations of climate change and potential future climate change regulation in
the jurisdictions in which the Group operates is highly uncertain. See “Risk Factors––Titan Group is subject to costs and
_liabilities related to stringent environmental and health and safety standards.”_

**Critical Accounting Policies**

Our financial statements and the accompanying notes contain information that is pertinent to this discussion and
analysis of our financial position and results of operations. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US
GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities,
revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are evaluated based on available
information and experience. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For a
summary of significant accounting policies see note B to the Audited Combined Financial Statements, included elsewhere in
this Offering Memorandum.

Throughout the periods covered by the Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Condensed
Combined Financial Statements, the Group operated as a part of the Crown Group. Consequently, stand-alone financial
statements have not been historically prepared for the Group. The financial statements have been derived from Crown’s
historical accounting records as if the Group operated on a stand-alone basis. The financial statements include the historical
operations, assets and liabilities of the legal entities and components of legal entities that are considered to comprise the Group’s
business.


-----

**Market Risk**

The main risks to which we are exposed in connection with our operations are raw material costs, interest rate risk
and the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates. We limit this exposure through established raw material pass-through
practices, as well as programs that include the use of derivative financial instruments, primarily swaps and forwards.
Counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions. These instruments are viewed as risk management tools,
involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. The extent to which we use such instruments is
dependent upon our access to them in the financial markets and our use of other methods, such as netting exposures for foreign
exchange risk and establishing sales arrangements that permit the pass-through to customers of changes in commodity prices
and foreign exchange rates.

**_Currency Exchange Risk_**

During the periods discussed in this Offering Memorandum, the Group presented its financial information in U.S.
Dollar. The Group operates in 17 countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and hence currency exchange risk arises from
commercial transactions and recognized assets and liabilities. As a result of the Audited Combined Financial Statements and
the Unaudited Interim Condensed Combined Financial Statements being presented in U.S. Dollar, the results of the Group are
also impacted by fluctuations in the U.S. Dollar exchange rate versus the functional currencies of the Group, including the Euro
(represents approximately 74% of our revenue), the British Sterling and the Moroccan Dirham.

Fluctuations in value of these currencies with respect to the U.S. Dollar may have a significant impact on our financial
condition and results of operations. We believe that a strengthening of the U.S. Dollar exchange rate by 1% against all functional
currencies from the December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 rate, respectively, would decrease invested capital by approximately
$18 million, $17 million and $19 million in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. On a forward
going basis, the Business will report in Euro, which is consistent with the primary functional currency of our operating units.

We manage foreign currency exposures at the operating unit level. Exposures that cannot be naturally offset within an
operating unit may be hedged with derivative financial instruments where possible and cost effective in our judgment. Foreign
exchange contracts generally mature within twelve months.

The table below provides information in U.S. Dollars as of March 31, 2021 about the Group’s forward currency
exchange contracts. The majority of the contracts expire in 2021 and primarily hedge anticipated transactions and unrecognized
firm commitments and are recorded at fair value. The contracts with no amounts in the fair value column have a fair value of
less than $1 million.

**Contract**
**fair value**

**Buy/Sell** **Contract Amount** **gain/(loss)**

# (in $ millions) U.S. Dollar/Euro ........................................................................ 31.8 (0.5) Sterling/Euro.............................................................................. 29.4 2.3 Euro/Sterling.............................................................................. 34.5 (2.9) U.S. Dollar/Sterling .................................................................... 17.9 1.3 Total ......................................................................................... 113.6 0.2

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

From time to time, we may manage our interest rate risk associated with fluctuations in variable interest rates through
interest rate swaps. The use of interest rate swaps and other methods of mitigating interest rate risk may increase overall interest
expense.

**_Commodity Risk_**

We are modestly exposed to the risk of fluctuations in commodity prices. Our primary raw material, tinplate steel, is
not a traded commodity and does not have a commonly accepted index price. Tinplate steel represents approximately 95% of
our metal purchases. Despite this dynamic, the nature of our annual tinplate steel pricing negotiations and subsequent pass

-----

through pricing strategies to customers for the following year provides a natural hedge as input cost changes are matched to
customer price changes.

We also purchase aluminum, which represents approximately 5% of our metal purchases. Aluminum is a traded
commodity that is regularly quoted on the LME. The risk of changes of the price of aluminum is connected with the common
practice of determining the prices in the contracts on the basis of the monthly average sales price of aluminum on the LME.
We endeavor to avoid unnecessary risks and limit the impact of threats related to our business to an acceptable level, which is
achieved primarily through contracts that pass-through raw material costs to customers and by means of hedging transactions.
As of March 31, 2021, the Group had forward commodity contracts to hedge aluminum price fluctuations with a notional value
of $12.3 million and a net gain of $2.9 million. The maturities of the commodity contracts closely correlate to the anticipated
purchases of those commodities.

**_Credit Risk_**

Credit risk arises from cash and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposure to our
customers, including outstanding receivables.

Credit risk has historically been managed by Crown’s central treasury function, who places excess liquid funds with
recognized and reputable financial institutions. The credit ratings of banks and financial institutions are monitored and the risk
of default is controlled by limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one bank or institution.

It is our policy to extend credit to customers in good standing. Credit risk is managed on an ongoing basis and we
periodically assess the financial reliability of customers, taking into account their financial position, past experience and other
factors. Provisions are made where deemed necessary and the utilization of credit limits is regularly monitored. We do not
expect any significant counterparty to fail to meet its payment obligations towards us. There is no recent history of material
non-payment default with any of our major customers.

**INDUSTRY OVERVIEW**

**Market Overview**

The global packaging industry is a large, consumer-driven industry with stable growth characteristics. We operate in
the metal container sectors and our primary operating regions are Europe, the Middle East and Africa, although we serve the
global market with certain of our products.

Metal packaging is becoming increasingly attractive to brands as their strength and rigidity allows them to be filled at
high speeds and easily transported, while their shelf-stable nature means that refrigeration is not required, thereby resulting in
further energy savings in the supply chain. The ability to customize and differentiate products supplied in metal containers,
through innovative design, shaping and printing, also appeals to our customers. Metal offers performance and convenience for
brands compared to alternatives. It acts as a superior barrier to oxygen and light and is resilient, as it can be durable, tamperproof and fire and temperature resistant. Moreover, it is convenient, and can be light and robust, with portable characteristics
and easy open and recloseable solutions. When used in the food market, metal has the advantage of retaining nutritional value,
without the requirement for preservatives. From a supply chain perspective, metal packaging allows for efficient transportation
and storage and is suited to processing on installed high-speed filling lines and retort processes.

Despite competition from other formats and materials, metal cans remain a key food packaging format, owing to their
attractive value proposition. The use of metal cans as a food packaging format is expected to have modest but stable growth of
0.6% per annum in the Group’s key markets of Western Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, between 2020
and 2025, principally driven by macroeconomic growth, as forecasted by Smithers.

Metal packaging is also increasingly attractive to both brands and end-consumers who are increasingly focused on
sustainability. Metal packaging has significant advantages compared to other packaging substrates. Recycling rates for steel
and aluminum in Europe are 83% and 76%, respectively, according to Metal Packaging Europe, amongst the highest of any
substrate. Moreover, metal’s properties never degrade during use or recycling, as a result, metal is considered a permanent
material and plays a critical role in the circular economy. Additionally, all unused material in the production process can be
recycled back into production, so no metal scrap created in production goes to waste. Beyond recyclability, metal packaging
also aids in sustainability on account of its functionality. Superior barrier properties (as described above) compared to other
substrates make metal packaging ideal for food preservation, reducing food waste, increasing the accessibility of healthy foods
in an economical manner and providing contamination protection, reducing the prevalence of food-borne illnesses.

Metal has gained increasing traction with brand owners who want to meet their own goals and commitments for
sustainability to satisfy their own end-consumers preferences. Companies such as Nestle and Princes Group, both key customers
of Titan Group, have stated that they intend to use 100% recyclable or reusable packaging by 2025, and Nestle has announced
that they will entirely eliminate the use of ten problematic plastics in their packaging by 2024.

Products in the EMEA region’s food can industry are concentrated amongst three food can types: 3-Piece, 2-Piece
Drawn and Wall Ironed (“DWI”) and 2-piece Draw Redraw (“DRD”). 3-Piece is a well-established, lower cost steel can with
flexible sizes that is used for almost all end-markets, including fish, culinary, pet and nutritional. 2-Piece Drawn Wall Ironed is
typically made of steel and has low production costs, high potential for down gauging and fewer can failure modes (with no
side seam or end seam) used mostly for seasonal, culinary and pet food end-markets. 2-Piece Draw Redraw is made from steel
or aluminum. This is used for shallower cans, offering a wide variety of shapes and high-quality printing. This can mostly
serves the fish, culinary and pet food end-markets.

Most of the sales in the EMEA region are concentrated in the 3-Piece steel cans, making up 73% of sales, with 2-Piece
Aluminum, 2-Piece Steel and other can types making up 11%, 15%, and 1% of can sales in the EMEA market, respectively, as
of October 2020, according to Management estimates. Titan Group’s product offering is aligned with the market. 74% of our
sales are 3-Piece Steel, and 2-Piece Aluminum and 2-Piece Steel make up 4% and 22% of our sales in the year ended December
31, 2020, respectively.

Metal packaging manufacturers hold a critical position in the EMEA food packaging supply chain. Tinplate is the
main raw material used in metal packaging production, with approximately 90% of all tinplate produced being used for
packaging products according to a leading global consulting firm. This creates an important dynamic between tin manufacturers
and can producers. Tinplate manufacturers rely on can manufacturers for a stable source of demand. As EU’s largest buyer of
tinplate, consuming 20% of all production in 2019 according to Management estimates, Titan Group represents a critical partner
to all major tinplate suppliers in Europe. On the consumers’ side, food producers and can fillers are highly fragmented and are


-----

dependent on the quality, safety and availability of cans. The critical position of can manufacturers in the value chain between
tinplate producers and food producers and can fillers provides staying power and margin expansion opportunities.

**Market Development and Outlook**

The food can packaging market, which is the second largest metal can packaging category globally after beverage
cans according to Wall Street equity research, has historically experienced stable demand throughout economic cycles. In
Europe, the food cans industry sold approximately 26.7 billion units in 2020 according to a leading global consulting firm,
representing a CAGR of 0.2% since 2015. Specifically, many key food end-markets including fruit & vegetables, shelf stable
fish, culinary (such as baked beans), pet food and infant formula have shown resilience over time. According to a leading global
consulting firm analysis representing trends for European food cans volume sold, market growth of fruits & vegetables, culinary
and pet food have each fluctuated by CAGRs of less than +/-1% between 2015 and 2020. Shelf stable fish, culinary and pet
food are expected to fluctuate by CAGRs of less than +/-1% between 2020 and 2024, with infant nutrition expected to grow by
a CAGR of 1.0% from 2020 to 2023. Fruits & vegetables are expected to decline by a CAGR of 1.4% between 2020 and 2024.

Shelf stable foods represent a consumer diet staple across most cultures and geographies. Metal cans currently
represent the best barrier material and provides over two years of shelf-life, which is critical for managing seasonal harvest
cycles. This shelf-life helps maintain the availability of the underlying food product for consumers, should there be a poor
harvest of the relevant item during this two-year period. In 2020, shelf stable foods experienced additional growth attributed to
an increase in at-home meal consumption and evolving consumer preferences due to the COVID-19 pandemic, although this
benefit was somewhat offset by reduced demand for food cans in food service applications. A majority of the recent demand
increases and underlying trends are forecast to persist according to a leading global consulting firm, with sustainability trends
expected to provide favorable long-term market tailwinds. These developments are supported by recent innovations into
convenient, single-serve packaging offerings. Pet food and infant nutrition represent particular areas of potential growth. The
dog and cat populations in Europe continue to increase and pet owners have demonstrated a willingness to spend considerable
sums on their pets. Furthermore, Europe exports a significant amount of infant nutrition products and over the past 10 years
over $1 billion has been invested in Europe for filling infant nutrition into metal cans.

**_Competitive Landscape_**

The European food cans and ends packaging market is mature and heavily consolidated with the top two players, Titan
Group is a clear leader in the food can market, with 39% market share based on 2019 / 2020 EU food cans volume. Collectively,
the top two participants in the market hold a combined market share of over 65% based on 2019 / 2020 volume, with no other
manufacturer having a market share of greater than 3% according to leading global consulting firm. Other manufacturers consist
of mostly regional or local manufacturers, which are limited in scale and footprint to serve customers on a pan-European basis.

The European food cans and ends packaging market is relatively insulated from imports given the uneconomical cost
of shipping finished metal packaging long distances. In addition, due to the time sensitive nature of customers’ requirements,
customers prefer shorter supply chains, benefiting manufacturers that are located nearby to customers. Furthermore, new
challengers in the markets face significant obstacles in the form of high barriers to entry for numerous reasons. Sizable capital
requirements are needed to add capacity, particularly in the front-end of operations such as coil cutting, printing and lacquering.
Additionally, new entrants find economic benefits of adding capacity limited, especially in mature markets with entrenched
customers. There are also rigorous qualification requirements demanded by sensitive food end-markets. Additionally, many
customers have filling lines which are tuned to work with certain suppliers, resulting in high switching costs and creating a
barrier for new entrants in the market. Lastly, inherent strengths of the metal substrate, including rigidity and corrosion
resistance, provides tinplate with a degree of protection against substitution from other substrates like aluminum or plastics.

**_Additional Product Markets_**

Closures, aerosols and promotional packaging markets represent smaller subsectors of the metal packaging industry.
Metal vacuum closures exist in a variety of shapes, sizes and specifications and help provide easy-open convenience and visual
appeal for packaging across various substrates. Aerosols come in various diameters and finishings, serving mainly the personal
care, food and household end-markets. Promotional and premium containers come in numerous lid and closure variations,
servicing mostly the biscuits, powders, confectionery and syrup end-markets.

Within Closures, Titan Group holds the number two market position with over 25% market share in Europe as of
October 2020 according to Management estimates. The Group’s primary closures competitors include Silgan, Technocap and
Massilly.

**Overview**

We are a European leader in the design, manufacture and sale of metal packaging solutions, with number one or
number two market positions across our product groups in the countries we operate in. We are the clear market leader in the
26.7-billion-unit European market for metal food cans and ends, holding the number one market position with an approximate
39% market share based on volume in the year ended December 31, 2020. As the largest European manufacturer of metal food
cans and ends and the largest European buyer of tinplate steel (based on our estimated consumption of approximately 20% of
total European tinplate production), our business is a critical asset in the European food supply chain.

We have been in the industry for more than 200 years and have an established reputation for the highest quality
products and exceptional customer service. From the founding of our predecessor business in 1799 to our acquisition by Crown
in 1996 and our acquisition of Mivisa in 2014, our business has shown itself to be a leader in European metal packaging time
and time again. Following the Transactions, we will become a leading stand-alone business in Europe.

Our product portfolio consists predominantly of food packaging, with approximately 95% of our sales in the year
ended December 31, 2020 going to food related end markets. Our products are used by hundreds of millions of consumers on
a daily basis across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we produced approximately 12
billion food cans, approximately 24 billion ends, approximately 5.3 billion metal closures, approximately 581 million aerosol
cans and approximately 134 million metal promotional packaging containers. Our products are used to package food in a
diverse array of end-markets, including fruits and vegetables, tomatoes, fish, pet food, culinary, infant nutrition and dairy. Each
of our end-markets is driven by fundamental demand drivers that are stable and largely uncorrelated with broader
macroeconomic cycles.

**Note: For the year ended December 31, 2020**
1. According to leading global consulting firm
2. According to Management estimates

We sell our products in more than 90 countries with France, Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy and Germany
representing 15%, 14%, 12%, 11% and 7% of our sales, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2020 and other


-----

geographies making up the remaining 41% of sales in the same period. Sales to our top 10 customers represented just 32% of
our total sales in the year ended December 31, 2020. We benefit from long-standing relationships with our customers, having
worked with our top 10 customers for an average of over 25 years.

Our business is significantly insulated from raw material price fluctuation through a combination of formulaic and
negotiated raw material pass-through mechanisms, providing us with margin stability and consistent historical cash flows. We
have demonstrated our ability to pass through fluctuations in the prices of our raw material inputs over the long term. Moreover,
as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, Titan Group’s pass-through was on track for full recovery of raw material price
increases in 2021. Based on Management estimates, the vast majority of sales are covered by at least annual contracts, with up
to 40% of total sales secured on multi-year contracts. Our customer contracts provide sales volume visibility, as many contracts
stipulate a guaranteed percentage of total customer orders for the term of the contract.

We operate 44 strategically located manufacturing facilities (in addition to the Braunstone site, which will be
transferred at the end of the transition period) in 17 countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, which enhance our access
to customer end-markets and support local demand. Our manufacturing scale is complemented by our services and customer
support capabilities including over 20 technical services locations, seven dedicated product design studios, four dedicated
laboratory testing facilities and a world-class research and development facility that have put us at the forefront of the European
tinplate packaging industry.

In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, we had net sales of $2,241 million, $2,138 million and $2,227
million, respectively, and Adjusted EBITDA of $303 million, $247 million and $267 million, respectively. Our net sales and
Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA were $2,297 million and $317 million, respectively, for the twelve months ended March 31,
2021. These amounts translate, for convenience purposes only, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, to net
sales of €1,897 million, €1,910 million and €1,951 million, respectively, and Adjusted EBITDA of €256 million, €221 million
and €234 million, respectively, and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, to net sales and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
of €1,974 million and €272 million, respectively.

**Strengths**

**_1. Longstanding European market leader and critical asset in the European food packaging supply chain_**

We are the clear leader in the European market for food cans and ends, holding the number one market position with
an approximate 39% market share based on volume in the year ended December 31, 2020. Sales of metal food cans and ends
represented 85% of our total revenue in this period. We also believe that we hold the number one or number two market position
in Europe across the other product categories we serve, namely metal closures, aerosol cans and promotional containers with
market shares of approximately 28%, 12% and 24%, respectively, measured by volume for the year ended December 31, 2020.
We have been in the European market for over 200 years and have a reputation with customers for providing the highest quality
products and superior service.

In the year ended December 31, 2020, we produced approximately 12 billion food cans, approximately 24 billion
ends, approximately 5.3 billion metal closures, approximately 581 million aerosol cans and approximately 134 million metal
promotional packaging containers. Including intermediate precursor products, our manufacturing assets produce 500 million
products per day on average. We have a well-established manufacturing presence with 44 strategically located manufacturing
facilities (in addition to the Braunstone site, which will be transferred at the end of the transition period) across 17 countries
enhancing access to customers, end markets, local demand and suppliers. We operate 34 food cans & ends manufacturing
facilities (in addition to the Braunstone site, which will be transferred at the end of the transition period), five closures
manufacturing facilities, three aerosol manufacturing facilities and three promotional packaging manufacturing facilities. We
have a well-invested asset base supported by in-house research and development expertise. We believe the investment required
to replicate our facility footprint, in addition to the know-how of operating canmaking assets that we developed over our history
create high barriers to entry.

The European market for food cans and ends is mature and highly consolidated with the top two players, ourselves
and our primary competitor, holding a combined market share of over 65% based on volume in the year ended December 31,
2020. The third largest manufacturer has a market share of 3%. Other competitors consist of mostly regional or local
manufacturers, who lack the ability to serve larger food customers at scale or are limited in their ability to serve customers
across multiple geographies. The European food cans and ends market is relatively insulated from import competition given
the high cost of shipping metal packaging long distances and the short lead times customers demand. Due to the significance
of transportation costs in the food can industry, our regional production capabilities support expedient and cost-efficient
transportation to local customers. Furthermore, there are high barriers to entry due to sizeable capital requirements needed to


-----

add capacity, rigorous qualification requirements demanded by customers, and heightened scrutiny with respect to safety
requirements as a result of serving sensitive food end-markets.

We hold a critical position in the European food packaging supply chain as the largest European manufacturer of metal
food cans and ends and the largest European buyer of tinplate steel. Our business is the key link between tinplate steel, a
commodity raw material that we purchase and convert to finished packaging for our large and fragmented, primarily European,
customer base of food manufacturers. Can producers are the largest consumers of tinplate steel in Europe, with approximately
90% of tinplate steel in Europe being used in packaging, of which 40 to 50% is for food cans and 10 to 15% is for each of
beverages, general line, aerosols and closures. Moreover, the market is largely stable with no significant shifts expected. We
are Europe’s largest buyer of tinplate, consuming approximately 20% of all tinplate production in Europe in 2020 according to
Management estimates. Tinplate steel suppliers rely on us for a stable source of demand, and our position as the largest
consumer of tinplate steel makes us a critical partner to all of the major suppliers of tinplate steel in the European market. Our
over 1,000 customers rely on us as Europe’s largest supplier of food cans and ends. Because of our scale, we are often the only
supplier that can serve high volume customers on a pan-European basis. Our customers depend on our supply to go to market
and rely on our packaging to ensure their products reach store shelves. We provide their products with the benefit of a long
shelf life that metal food cans offer. Our packaging is an important part of our customers’ brands, and we work closely with
our customers to develop designs that ensure their products are attractive to end-consumers at points of sale.

**_2. Diverse, stable revenue mix with exposure to a range of non-cyclical, food-related end markets_**

We sell essential food packaging products into a highly diverse mix of geographies, customers and end-markets, which
supports revenue stability and resilience. Our products serve over 90 countries consisting of both sales into mature, developed
countries and higher growth, developing countries. No single country represented more than 15% of our sales in the year ended
December 31, 2020, with the largest contributors being France, Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy and Germany at 15%, 14%,
12%, 11% and 7% of sales, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2020.

Our product portfolio consists 95% of food packaging, which has historically experienced stable demand throughout
economic cycles. We serve numerous food-related end-markets, including shelf-stable fruit and vegetables, shelf-stable fish,
culinary (such as baked beans), pet food and infant formula, which represented 24%, 18%, 11%, 8% and 8% of sales,
respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2020. Each of our end-markets is driven by fundamental demand drivers, such as
population growth, eating at home trends, urbanization, and a growing global middle class, that are stable and largely
uncorrelated with broader macroeconomic cycles, and not subject to significant innovation threats.


-----

**Note: For the year ended December 31, 2020**

Metal cans represent the best barrier material and provide a shelf life of over two years while still retaining the
freshness of the food being packaged. In addition, metal food cans provide a host of other benefits to our customers, including
i) allowing for fast filling speeds with limited loss, ii) having high strength and allowing for ease of handling and iii) being
resistant to corrosion, thereby allowing for high-acid contents (e.g., tomatoes). These qualities make our products highly costeffective solutions for our customers and limit the threat of substitution from other substrates.

The stability of our end-markets is evidenced by their historical and forecast growth rates. According to a leading
global consulting firm market growth for the packaging of shelf stable vegetables, culinary products, infant nutrition products
and shelf stable fish in Europe have each fluctuated by CAGRs of less than +/-1.5% between 2015 and 2020, and are expected
to fluctuate by CAGRs of less than +/-1.5% between 2020 and 2024. Furthermore, between 2015 and 2020 the food can volumes
sold in Iberia grew by a CAGR of 2% and in our other key markets of France, Italy, the UK and Germany food can volumes
fluctuated by a CAGR of less than +/-1.5% over this period.

**_3. Diverse, blue-chip customer base with longstanding, contractual relationships_**

We supply over 1,000 customers across a range of resilient product categories and end markets. No single customer
represented more than 8% of our sales in the year ended December 31, 2020, with our top 10 customers representing 32% of
sales for the same period. Our customers include blue-chip, global food and consumer businesses including Abbott, Bonduelle,
Danone, Nestle and Unilever, large national and regional food companies, as well as many smaller and independent fisheries
and farmers. We benefit from long-standing relationships with our customers, having worked with our top 10 customers on
average for over 25 years. We are the sole or main supplier for several of our top customers. We believe that the quality of our
products, our track record of providing reliable supply proven over decades and the significant costs to customers involved in
switching manufacturers creates customer stickiness. Before a manufacturing plant or line can begin manufacturing new can
SKUs for a customer, its products typically must be qualified through a process that can take several months to over a year. In
addition, can manufacturers may face downtime on their lines when running new SKUs, thereby impacting customers’ security
and reliability of supply. Customers who decide to change manufacturers also typically lose the benefit of volume rebates from
former suppliers and face uncertainty regarding the stability, reliability and quality of their new partners.

Customers praise our technological know-how, understanding of their requirements and ability to produce and deliver
large volumes of specialty food cans consistently on time and in full. Our customers incur high costs if their packaging is not
delivered when required. As an example, tomatoes must be sealed in their packaging within six hours of being picked to ensure
their freshness, often requiring our manufacturing facilities to ship dozens of truckloads of food cans per day in a continuous
rotation to certain customer facilities during harvest season. We are recognized as an industry leader in product development
and deliver solutions that offer greater consumer convenience and functionality in response to market demands. Can fillers
require producers who can satisfy their branding, quality and safety needs. We believe we consistently satisfy these needs and
enable our customers to differentiate their brands through packaging and address changing safety requirements ahead of time.

**_4. Sustainability- and consumer-driven tailwinds benefit metal packaging_**

Our metal packaging products are favorably positioned to benefit from the increase in demand for sustainable
packaging given their infinitely recyclable nature. Greater environmental consciousness and strong sustainability trends are
expected to support an increased preference for metal packaging over the long-term. End consumers increasingly view
sustainability as a key purchasing criteria and seek out more environmentally friendly packaging. Food producers – our
customers – are aggressively responding to this demand. For example, several major food conglomerates have announced that
they aim to sell mostly recyclable or reusable materials by 2025. These trends are further reinforced by regulatory
developments. For example, the EU circular economy plan adopted in 2020 has a clear focus on recyclable packaging, which
is likely to put pressure on plastic in favor of other packaging materials. Metal packaging provides excellent options for the
sustainability initiatives of companies and brands, since metal properties do not degrade during use or recycling. Consumers
already recognize metal packaging as a highly recyclable substrate, evidenced by recycling rates of over 80% for steel and 75%
for aluminum in Europe, and food brands increasingly want to position themselves as environmentally friendly.

As a further sustainability benefit, metal packaging’s superior barrier properties make it ideal for food preservation,
which reduces food waste. Metal packaging increases the accessibility of healthy foods in an economical manner and provides
contamination protection, thereby reducing the prevalence of food-borne illnesses.


-----

Within the metal packaging industry, we are a European leader in sustainability awareness as a Co-Founder of the
Metal Packaging Europe Association and an active participant in other major sustainability focused associations, which serve
as conduits for sustainability reform at the regulatory and legislative level.

**_5. Attractive financial profile with flexible cost structure and ability to generate consistent free cash flow_**

We have a strong track-record of robust free cash flow generation and cash conversion as a result of our flexible cost
structure and resilient cash flows. We generated average annual free cash flow of $239 million and an average cash conversion
rate of approximately 88% from 2018 to 2020.

Our business is significantly insulated from raw material price fluctuation through a combination of formulaic and
negotiated pass-through mechanisms, providing us with consistent historical cash flows and supporting our margins. We have
demonstrated our ability to pass through fluctuations in the prices of our raw material inputs over the long term. Based on
Management estimates, the vast majority of sales are covered by at least annual contracts, with up to 40% of total sales secured
on multi-year contracts. Our customer contracts provide sales volume visibility, as many contracts stipulate a guaranteed
percentage of total customer orders for the term of the contract. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, over 97% of
Titan Group’s pricing for 2021 was already agreed.

We estimate that approximately 87% of our cost base is fully- or semi-variable, consisting mostly of material costs,
labor costs, freight, energy, which represented 61%, 15%, 5% and 3%, respectively, of our total costs for the year ended
December 31, 2020 in addition to other consumables. The semi-variable characteristics of our labor costs come from our ability
to reduce our labor costs through the use of seasonal and temporary employees. Our variable cost structure allows us to quickly
adapt our production capacity to harvest cycles, which can result in modest volume fluctuations from year to year.

Our cash flow stability is bolstered by the non-cyclical end-markets we serve, our ability to pass-through raw material
prices changes, our long-term customer relationships with contracted volumes, and customer stickiness. Our modest capital
expenditure requirements and well-managed, disciplined approach to working capital further strengthen our free cash flow
conversion. We believe our free cash flow profile will enable us to reduce leverage through debt repayment over time.

**_6. Experienced management team supported by a best-in-class financial sponsor_**

We benefit from a talented management team with deep roots in the business and decades of experience. Our
management team has a strong track-record of value creation in the consumer packaging industry and has an average 30 years
of service in the industry.

Our management team has been involved in the preparation of our transition from being a part of Crown to operating
as a stand-alone business, including the development of our stand-alone strategy. We have also moved to reinforce the team in
its new existence as a stand-alone company by announcing the appointment of Tomás López as Chief Executive Officer. Mr
López will bring experience and a track-record of success in managing Mivisa before it was acquired by Crown. See also
“Management.”

KPS Capital Partners (“KPS”) has a strong track-record of realising improvements in manufacturing companies and
over two decades of constructive investing in highly complex corporate carve-outs on a global basis. KPS creates value for its
investors by working constructively with talented management teams to make businesses better, and generates investment
returns by structurally improving the strategic position, competitiveness and profitability of its portfolio companies, rather than
primarily relying on financial leverage. KPS will support management and leverage its core operational improvement expertise.
Furthermore, Crown will retain a 20% equity stake in the stand-alone company, validating its belief in the potential of the
business and allow for a smooth transition of the business to an independent company.

**Strategy**

Our strong cash flow generation has historically been utilized in support of broader goals within the larger Crown
organization. We have a unique position in the European food supply chain as the largest manufacturer of food cans and ends
in Europe and we believe that we are the largest buyer of tinplate steel in Europe. We believe that, despite our market position,
our historic margins have lagged those of key competitors and our own potential as a result of the lack of focus on our business
under our prior owners. Under Crown’s ownership, the business has mainly focused on volumes and cash generation to support
Crown’s other businesses, which presents a significant opportunity for margin improvement. From 2017 to 2020, Titan Group
represented approximately 20% of Crown’s sales but only 8% of its capital expenditures.


-----

As a stand-alone business, we aim to reorient the business towards growth and margin improvement. Capitalizing on
the above strengths as a stand-alone business, we believe we have numerous levers to create additional value, grow volumes,
improve profitability and generate cash flows.

**_1. New Markets and Growth Opportunities_**

The Business has numerous growth opportunities arising from favorable consumption trends, such as a greater focus
on convenience, growth in single serve packaging, increasing premiumization and higher focus on sustainability. Operating as
a stand-alone entity, we will have greater flexibility to pursue opportunities that were not previously considered or prioritized
while integrated within the wider Crown business. In addition, we will have the benefit of a steady capital expenditure program
that is focused on our business, allowing us to pursue multi-year growth projects which we were unable to pursue under prior
ownership. End-markets such as infant nutrition and wet petfood have volume growth opportunities at attractive margins that
we believe we can capture by employing our capabilities and expertise developed in other end-markets. Our metal cans are
well-positioned to benefit from these growth opportunities in light of their favorable barrier properties and the premium
perception and convenience that our products offer. In addition, we are focused on growing our share and penetration in key
emerging markets such as Eastern Europe and Africa, where our existing customers are establishing footprints that we can
readily support with existing technologies and know-how.

**_2. Procurement Optimization_**

Tinplate steel makes up for more than 80% of our raw materials spend and represented 48% of our cost of products
sold in the year ended December 31, 2020. We believe our market position enables us to optimize sourcing and pricing for our
tinplate steel purchases and provides further opportunities for margin expansion. While the Business under Crown’s ownership
mainly focused on ensuring stability of supply and favorable working capital arrangements, as a stand-alone business we will
have the opportunity to manage supply arrangements in support of better margins, including through utilizing a greater share
of raw materials from low cost countries. We have developed optimization initiatives to realize the most favorable pricing with
suppliers for the highest quality tinplate with the shortest supply chain lead times.

There is potential for additional cost savings opportunities in the form of reduced spend on logistics, raw material
specification complexity reductions, indirect cost savings and contract structure improvements. We believe there is an
opportunity to purchase higher volume of fewer SKUs, and also consolidate production of precursor products into fewer
facilities, thereby reducing the number of facilities receiving raw material shipments and to improve the structure of certain of
our contracts. In addition, we believe there are opportunities to optimize indirect and other materials procurement through
targeted sourcing initiatives. In the three months ended March 31, 2021, Titan Group already realized the benefit of improved
procurement practices and commercial efforts, leading to expanding margins for this period.

**_3. Manufacturing Optimization_**

We expect to realize further efficiencies by improving the asset utilization and productivity of our manufacturing
footprint. We intend to employ targeted capital expenditures focused on modernizing the equipment used at several of our key
facilities with a goal of increasing the capacity of those facilities and allowing more efficient and cost-effective production
while reducing the number of facilities in our network.

Our Business grew substantially following the acquisition of Mivisa in 2014, however, we did not fully integrate the
Mivisa and legacy manufacturing footprints and did not achieve the margin targets or synergies forecast at the time. We believe
that there are certain manufacturing function overlaps and duplications as a result of the acquisition and our organic growth.
We intend to replicate the “hub and spoke” operating model, used successfully by Mivisa, whereby certain functions that can
easily and cost-effectively be transported are completed at lower cost plants to improve and optimize asset utilization. For
example, we believe that the manufacturing of ends and certain upstream functions such as metal processing and coating can
be consolidated into facilities that specialize in production of those precursor products. Such products would then be transported
to existing can finishing or assembly plants that are located close to our customers and have a lean operating footprint. This
approach was successfully developed at Mivisa, which operated the largest ends production facility in the world in Murcia,
Spain, producing more than 9 billion ends annually and serviced nearly its entire network using this plant and also serviced a
significant export business of ends. We intend to replicate this model across the Group’s existing manufacturing footprint.

**_4. Commercial Excellence and Continuous Improvement Initiatives_**

In addition to revenue improvement and market share capture, our strategy also has a strong focus on delivering further
cost savings and unlocking further margin improvement potential. We plan to develop a continuous improvement culture and


-----

invest in training across the entire business. KPS and Management have conducted a comprehensive and granular review of
our operating model. We believe that as a stand-alone business, we will be able to realize these cost savings and margin
expansions based on KPS’ proven track record in realising improvements in manufacturing businesses.

We have identified a number of commercial excellence and continuous improvement priorities, including (i) more
focused deployment of capital expenditures, (ii) quality management in the form of manufacturing and operational excellence
initiatives; (iii) maintenance and repair optimization, (iv) using a local sales force to improve engagement between our sales
and operations teams and (v) a focus on customer service, innovation and responsiveness initiatives. As a stand-alone business
focused on the manufacturing of food cans and ends, we will be more readily able to pursue these opportunities rather than
having to compete with the other capital priorities of our former owner.

Our planned capital projects include investments focused on asset productivity, such as tooling upgrades to multi-die
presses and high speed printing and coating lines capable of delivering up to 300% improvements in productivity. Our planned
capital projects typically have a payback of approximately two to three years. We also believe there is an opportunity to improve
the effectiveness of our commercial function by streamlining our financial reporting structure, providing greater visibility to
our local sales teams and enabling them to optimize the margin profile of products they are selling. We believe our customers
derive significant value from our product offering and we intend to capture additional margin for the superior service and
capabilities that we offer.

**Our History**

We have been in the industry for more than 200 years and have an established reputation for the highest quality
products and exceptional customer service. From the founding of our predecessor business in 1799 to our acquisition by Crown
in 1996 and our acquisition of Mivisa in 2014, our business has shown itself to be a leader in European metal packaging time
and time again. Following the Transactions, we will become a leading stand-alone business in Europe.

The businesses, operations, assets and liabilities comprising the Titan Group are currently being operated as part and
under the umbrella of the global Crown Group. On April 8, 2021, Bidco and Crown entered into the Acquisition Agreement
pursuant to which Crown has agreed to sell the Titan Group to Bidco pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the
Acquisition Agreement. Upon completion of the Acquisition, Bidco and its direct and indirect shareholders will become the
majority shareholder of our business (with Crown retaining a 20% ownership stake) and Titan Group will operate on a
standalone basis, see also “Risk Factors––We have no operating history as a standalone company.”

The proceeds of the Offering will, upon satisfaction of the conditions to release from the Escrow Account, be used to
fund part of the cash portion of the consideration due to Crown under the Acquisition Agreement. As of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, neither the Issuer, nor Bidco has any material assets or liabilities nor have the Issuer or Bidco engaged in any
activities other than those related to their incorporation and registration and the Acquisition. Unless otherwise required by the
context, this Offering Memorandum presents our business and operations and other information as if the Acquisition has
occurred.

**Our Products**

We supply total packaging solutions, including metal cans, ends and closures, tinplate aerosol cans and promotional
premium metal containers while working closely with customers, retailers and glass and plastic container manufacturers to
develop innovative closure solutions and meet customer requirements. The Group’s commitment to innovation has led to
developments in packaging materials, surface finishes, can shaping, lithography, filling, retorting, sealing and opening
techniques and environmental performance. Through our manufacturing network of 44 facilities in Europe, the Middle East
and Africa (and the Braunstone UK facility, which Crown will transfer to the Titan Group post-closing), we serve our customers
in over 92 countries.

**_Food Cans and Ends_**

The Group manufactures a variety of food cans, including two-piece and three-piece cans in numerous shapes and
sizes, which are being sold to global and regional food producers, independent fisheries and farmers. Some of Titan Group’s
food cans and ends customers include Abbot Laboratories, Bonduelle, C&D Foods, Jealsa, Nestle and Princes Group, among
others. Technologies used to produce food cans include three-piece welded, two-piece drawn and wall-ironed and two-piece
drawn and redrawn.


-----

The Group also manufactures easy open, vacuum and conventional ends for a variety of heat-processed and dry food
products including fruits and vegetables, meat and seafood, soups, ready-made meals, infant formula, coffee and pet food. The
Group owns several trademarks and offers a series of can ends, including its Easylift™ full aperture steel food can ends, and
PeelSeam™ and PeelFit™, flexible aluminum foil laminated food can ends to its customers.

We serve our food cans and ends customers from our 34 metal can and ends manufacturing facilities located in Europe,
the Middle East and Africa.

**_Closures_**

The Group also offers a wide variety of metal vacuum closures and sealing equipment solutions to leading global and
regional food producers including Andros Foods, Danone, Greencore, Neerlands Glorie, Orkla and Unilever, among others.


-----

The Group offers expertise in closure design and decoration, ranging from quality printing of the closure in up to nine colors,
to inside-the-cap printing, which offers customers new promotional possibilities and better product protection through our
trademark Orbit™. We serve our closures customers from five manufacturing facilities located in Europe.

**_Aerosol Cans_**

The Group’s customers for aerosol cans and ends include manufacturers of personal care, food, household and
industrial products, including Friesland Campina, SC Johnson, Unilever and WD-40, among others. The Group offers its
customers a broad range of products including multiple sizes and finishing schemes as well as a full array of design, technical
and market support services. We serve our aerosols customers from three aerosols manufacturing facilities located in Europe.


-----

**_Promotional Packaging_**

The Group’s promotional packaging business is primarily located in Europe. The Group produces a wide variety of
promotional and premium containers with numerous lid and closure variations. The Group offers its customers an extensive
portfolio of packaging designs and printing capabilities that help differentiate its products (and those of its customers) in the
marketplace. The Group was awarded the Can of the Year award in 2020 by The Canmaker magazine for packaging it designed
and produced for Fishers Gin, which serves as an example of the Group’s leading capabilities in promotional packaging. Some
of the Group’s promotional packaging customers include Ferrero, Britvic Nestle and Mondelez, primarily for promotional
activities. We serve our promotional packaging customers from three promotional packaging manufacturing facilities located
in the United Kingdom.

**Sales and Distribution**

Titan Group’s customers qualify suppliers on the basis of their ability to provide consistent service with strong quality
performance, innovative designs and technologies in a cost-effective manner.


-----

The Group markets and sells products to customers through its own sales and marketing staff. Contracts with large
customers are generally centrally negotiated, but products are ordered through and distributed directly by the Group’s local
facilities. The Group’s facilities are generally located in proximity to their respective major customers, particularly for food
cans, as these products do not ship cost-effectively across long distances. The Group works closely with customers to develop
new business and to extend the terms and scope of its existing contracts.

Many customers provide the Group with quarterly or annual estimates of product requirements along with related
quantities pursuant to which periodic commitments are given. Such estimates assist the Group in managing production and
controlling use of working capital. The Group schedules its production to meet customer requirements. Because the production
time for the Group’s products is short, any backlog of customer orders in relation to overall sales is not significant.

**Seasonality**

The food packaging business is seasonal with the first quarter tending to be the slowest period as the autumn packing
period in the Northern Hemisphere has ended and new crops are not yet planted. The industry generally enters its busiest period
in the third quarter when the majority of fruits and vegetables are harvested. Due to this seasonality, inventory levels increase
in the first half of the year to meet peak demand in the second and third quarters. Weather represents a substantial uncertainty
in the yield of food products and is a major factor in determining the demand for food cans in any given year. See also “Risk
_Factors––Titan Group's business is seasonal and adverse weather conditions could reduce Titan Group's net sales.”_

The Group’s other businesses primarily include aerosol and specialty packaging and can making equipment, which
tend not to be as significantly affected by seasonal variations.

**Competition**

Most of the Group’s products are sold in highly competitive markets, primarily based on price, quality, service and
performance. The Business competes with other packaging manufacturers as well as with fillers, food processors and packers,
who, to a limited extent, manufacture containers for their own use and for sale to others. The Group’s competitors include, but
are not limited to, Massilly, Silgan Holdings, Trivium, Auxiliar, DomIberia, Glud Marstrand and Sarten.

**Customers**

The Group’s customers consist of global and regional food producers, consumer products manufacturers and
marketers and independent fisheries and farmers. The Group was the sole or primary supplier for its top ten customers with
whom it had an average relationship of over 25 years. The Group’s top ten customers represented in the aggregate
approximately 32% of its net sales in the year ended December 31, 2020. In each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019
and 2018, no one customer accounted for more than 7% of the Group’s net sales. See also “Risk Factors––The loss of a major
_customer and/or customer consolidation could reduce Titan Group's net sales and profitability.” The contracts with our_
customers generally provide for the pass-through of metal price fluctuations. In addition, multiyear relationships allow both
parties to work together to streamline the product, service and supply process, potentially leading to cost reductions and
improvements in product and service, with benefits arising to both parties. Wherever possible, we seek to enter into multi-year
supply agreements with our customers. See also below under “––Research and Development.” Titan’s product offerings are
complemented by topline services and customer support. Titan Group has over 20 customer technical services locations, 7
dedicated product design studios and 4 dedicated laboratory testing facilities.

**Research and Development**

The Group’s principal Research, Development & Engineering (“RD&E”) Center is located in Wantage, England. The
Group utilizes its centralized RD&E capabilities to advance and deliver technologies for its international packaging activities
that (1) promote development of value-added metal packaging systems for its customers, (2) design cost-efficient
manufacturing processes, systems and materials that further the sustainability of metal packaging, (3) provide continuous
quality and/or production efficiency improvements in its manufacturing facilities, (4) advance customer and vendor
relationships, and (5) provide value-added engineering services and technical support. These capabilities facilitate (1) the
identification of new and/or expanded market opportunities by working directly with customers to develop new packaging
products or enhance existing packaging products through the application of new technologies that better differentiate our
customers’ products in the retail environment (for example, the creation of new packaging shapes or novel decoration methods)
and/or the incorporation of consumer-valued features (for example, improved openability and ease of use) and (2) the reduction
of manufacturing costs by reducing the material content of the Group‘s products (while retaining necessary performance
characteristics), reducing spoilage, and increasing operating efficiencies in our manufacturing facilities.


-----

The Group maintains a substantial portfolio of patents and other intellectual property (IP) in the field of metal
packaging ends and closures, in particular, and seeks strategic partnerships to extend its IP in existing and emerging markets.

The Group spent $6.9 million, $6.8 million and $7.3 million in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018,
respectively in its centralized RD&E activities. Certain of these activities are expected to improve and expand the Group’s
product lines in the future. These expenditures include projects within the Group’s RD&E facilities to improve manufacturing
efficiencies, reduce unit costs, and develop new and improved value-added packaging systems. These expenditures do not
include related product and process developments occurring within the Group’s decentralized business units.

**Materials and Suppliers**

The Group uses various raw materials, primarily tinplate steel, in its manufacturing operations. In general, these raw
materials are purchased in highly competitive, price-sensitive markets which have historically exhibited price and demand
cyclicality. These and other materials used in the manufacturing process have historically been available in adequate supply
from multiple sources.

Generally, the Group’s principal raw materials are obtained from the major suppliers in the regions in which it operates
plants. Titan Group estimates that it sources approximately 75-80% of its tinplate from the largest three European suppliers and
up to 25% from European challengers and imports from outside Europe, including China, Japan, Turkey and South Korea.
Some plants in less developed countries, which do not have local mills, obtain raw materials from nearby, more developed
countries. The Group has agreements for what it considers adequate supplies of raw materials. However, sufficient quantities
may not be available in the future due to, among other things, shortages due to excessive demand, weather or other factors,
including disruptions in supply caused by raw material transportation or production delays. From time to time, some of the raw
materials have been in short supply but, to date, these shortages have not had a significant impact on the Group’s operations.
See also “Risk Factors––Titan Group's financial results could be materially adversely affected if Titan Group is not able to
_secure sufficient quantities of raw materials or if the price of raw materials or energy rises and Titan Group cannot increase_
_the price of its products.”_

In the year ended December 31, 2020, consumption of tinplate steel represented approximately 48% of consolidated
cost of products sold, excluding depreciation and amortization. Due to the significance of tinplate steel to overall cost of
products sold, raw material efficiency is a critical cost component of the products manufactured. Supplier consolidations,
changes in ownership, government regulations, political unrest and increased demand for raw materials in the packaging and
other industries, among other risk factors, provide uncertainty as to the availability of and the level of prices at which the Group
might be able to source such raw materials in the future. Moreover, the price of raw materials can be subject to significant
volatility. The Group’s raw material supply contracts vary as to terms and duration, with tinplate steel contracts typically one
year in duration with fixed prices for the year. The Group generally attempts to mitigate its steel price risk by matching its
purchase obligations with its sales agreements; however, there can be no assurance that the Group will be able to fully mitigate
that risk. See also “Risk Factors––Titan Group's financial results could be materially adversely affected if Titan Group is not
_able to secure sufficient quantities of raw materials or if the price of raw materials or energy rises and Titan Group cannot_
_increase the price of its products.”_

There can be no assurance that the Group will be able to fully recover from its customers the impact of raw material
price increases or that the use of derivative instruments will effectively manage the Group’s exposure to price volatility. In
addition, if the Group is unable to purchase raw materials, particularly tinplate steel, for a significant period of time, its
operations would be disrupted and if the Group were unable to fully recover the higher cost of those raw materials, its financial
results may be adversely affected. The Group continues to monitor this situation and the effect on its operations. As a result of
continuing international supply and demand pressures, other commodity-related costs affecting the Group’s business may
increase as well, including natural gas, electricity and freight-related costs. The Group will attempt to increase prices on its
products accordingly in order to recover these costs.

In response to the volatility of raw material prices, ongoing productivity and cost reduction efforts in recent years
have focused on improving raw material cost management.

The Group’s manufacturing facilities are dependent, in varying degrees, upon the availability of water and processed
energy, such as natural gas and electricity. Certain of these may become difficult or impossible to obtain on acceptable terms
due to external factors which could increase the Group’s costs or interrupt its business.


-----

**Sustainability and Environmental, Health and Safety Matters**

The Group’s Credit Facilities Agreement is currently planned to incorporate a sustainability ratchet, whereby the
margin thereunder is subject to adjustment based on the Group’s performance measured against certain key performance
indicators, currently envisioned to be centered around greenhouse gas emissions, product lifecycle management and air quality.
The Group’s operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, including
notably those relating to treatment, storage and disposal of waste, the use of chemicals in the Group’s products and
manufacturing process, discharges into water, emissions into the atmosphere, remediation of soil and groundwater
contamination and protection of employee health and safety. Future regulations may impose stricter environmental
requirements on the packaging industry and may require additional capital investment. Anticipated future restrictions in some
jurisdictions on the use of certain coatings may require the Group to employ additional control equipment or process
modifications.

The Group has a Corporate Sustainability Policy and a Corporate Environmental Protection Policy. Environmental
awareness is a key component of sustainability. Environmental considerations are among the criteria by which the Group
evaluates projects, products, processes and purchases. The Group is committed to continuous improvement in product design
and manufacturing practices to provide the best outcome for the human and natural environment, both now and in the future.
The Group has annual objectives with an emphasis on spoilage reduction, resource realignments, efficiency improvements and
labor savings. By reducing the per-unit amount of raw materials used in manufacturing its products through “lightweighting”,
the Group can significantly reduce the amount of energy, water and other resources and associated emissions necessary to
manufacture metal containers. The Group aims to continue that process of improvement in its manufacturing process through
investment in machinery upgrades with state-of-the-art, energy-efficient technologies and standardization programs focused on
material and efficiency savings to assure that consumers and the environment are best served through the use of metal
packaging. The Group is also committed to providing a safe work environment for its employees through programs that
emphasize safety awareness and the elimination of injuries and incidents. The Group had no significant incidents in 2020.There
can be no assurance that current or future environmental laws or liabilities will not have a material effect on the Group’s
financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Discussion of the Group’s environmental matters is contained within
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Environmental Matters” and
“Description of Certain Financing and Guarantee Arrangements—Credit Facilities Agreement.”

**Employees**

At December 31, 2020, the Group had approximately 6,300 employees. Collective bargaining agreements with
varying terms and expiration dates cover approximately 5,500 employees. The Group does not expect that renegotiation of the
agreements expiring in 2021 will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or
cash flow. The Group does not currently expect that any collective bargaining agreements will need to be renegotiated as a
result of the Acquisition.

We do not currently anticipate material changes in the Group’s employee count after completion of the Acquisition.

**Properties**

As of December 31, 2020, the Group operated 44 manufacturing facilities of which 7 were leased. Certain leases
provide renewal or purchase options. The principal manufacturing facilities as at December 31, 2020 are listed below and are
grouped by jurisdiction.

The Group’s European headquarters are in Baar, Switzerland. The Group maintains a research facility in Wantage,
England.

The Group’s manufacturing and support facilities are designed according to the requirements of the products to be
manufactured. Therefore, the type of construction may vary from plant to plant. Warehouse space is generally provided at each
of the manufacturing locations, although the Group also leases outside warehouses.

Ongoing productivity improvements and cost reduction efforts in recent years have focused on upgrading and
modernizing facilities to reduce costs, improve efficiency and productivity and phase out uncompetitive facilities. The Group
has also opened new facilities to meet increases in market demand for its products. These actions reflect the Group’s continued
commitment to realign manufacturing facilities to maintain its competitive position in its markets. The Group continually
reviews its operations and evaluates strategic opportunities.


-----

Utilization of any particular facility varies based upon product demand. While not possible to measure with any degree
of certainty or uniformity the production capacity of these facilities, management believes that, if necessary, production can be
increased at several existing facilities through the addition of personnel, capital equipment and, in some facilities, square
footage available for production. In addition, the Group may from time to time acquire additional facilities or dispose of existing
facilities.

Excluded from the list below are operating facilities in unconsolidated subsidiaries as well as service or support
facilities. The service or support facilities include machine shop operations, plant operations dedicated to printing for cans and
closures, coil shearing, coil coating and RD&E operations. Some operating facilities produce more than one product but have
been presented below under the product with the largest contribution to sales.

The following table summarizes Titan Group’s principal list of manufacturing facilities:

(2) Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Russia, Poland, Portugal and Turkey.
(3) Ghana, Ivory Coast, Madagascar and Morocco.

**Insurance**

The Group carries insurance that it believes to be common in the industry and sufficient to cover the principal risks
of damage to its business. The Group maintains insurance policies with respect to certain operating risks, including product
liability, damage to property (including buildings, plants, machinery and stock, including as a result of catastrophic events
such as fire, flood, storms and earthquakes), industrial accidents, third-party liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, and
cyber-crime. The Group undertakes periodic risk reviews to assess whether its insurance is in line with its business risks and
whether the developments in insurance policies are reflective of the changes in its business. See "Risk Factors - We may be
_subject to losses that might be completely or partially uninsured."_

**Legal Proceedings**

In March 2015, the Bundeskartellamt, or German Federal Cartel Office (“FCO”), conducted unannounced inspections
of the premises of several metal packaging manufacturers, including one of the Group’s German subsidiaries. The local court
order authorizing the inspection cited FCO suspicions of anti-competitive agreements in the market for the supply of metal
packaging products. The Group conducted an internal investigation into the matter and discovered instances of inappropriate
conduct by certain employees of German subsidiaries of the Group. The Group cooperated with the FCO and submitted, in
September and October 2015, a leniency application with the FCO which disclosed the findings of its internal investigation to
date. In April 2018, the FCO discontinued its national investigation and referred the matter to the European Commission (the
“Commission”). Following the referral, Commission officials conducted unannounced inspections of the premises of several
metal packaging manufacturers, including Group subsidiaries in Germany, France and the United Kingdom.

The Commission’s investigation is ongoing and, to date, the Commission has not officially charged the Group or any
of its subsidiaries with violations of competition law. The Group is cooperating with the Commission and submitted a leniency
application in April 2018. This application may lead to the reduction of possible future penalties. At this stage of the
investigation the Group believes that a loss is probable but is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the Commission’s


-----

investigation and is unable to estimate the loss or possible range of losses that could be incurred, and has therefore not recorded
a charge in connection with the actions by the Commission. If the Commission finds that the Group or any of its subsidiaries
violated competition law, fines levied by the Commission as well as third party damage claims by private enforcement, class
action or individual claims and any related costs and damages could be material to the Company’s operating results and cash
flows for the periods in which they are resolved or become reasonably estimable. In the Acquisition Agreement, Crown has
agreed to indemnify us for certain losses in connection with this investigation.

In March 2018, the French Competition Authority started a preliminary investigation regarding possible
infringements to French competition law with respect to the switch to bisphenol-A free cans in France which implemented
legislation restricting the use of bisphenol-A in all recipients as of 1 January 2015. The French Syndicat National des Fabricants
_de Boîtes, a trade association representing food can suppliers in France of which Titan Group is a member, received a_
questionnaire from the French Competition Authority asking for information regarding the trade association’s activities in
relation to the development of BPA-NI cans. The French Competition Authority opened formal proceedings regarding possible
infringements of competition law in relation to the switch to bisphenol-free cans in France in September 2019. In the context
of the formal proceedings, the French Competition Authority sent, in January and February 2020, two questionnaires to Titan
Group relating to its activities, internal organization and identification of its different entities and their respective turnovers. In
January 2021, Titan Group received a request from the French Competition Authority asking for the permission to declassify
documents previously provided by Titan Group in response to the questionnaires received and Titan Group gave the French
Competition Authority the permission to do so.

The French Competition Authority's investigation is ongoing and, to date, Titan Group has not received any further
requests nor questionnaires from the French Competition Authority. At this stage of the investigation, Titan Group is unable to
predict the ultimate outcome of the French Competition Authority's investigation and is unable to estimate the loss that it could
incur. Should the Board of the French Competition Authority finds that Titan Group or any of its subsidiary violated French
competition law, the fine levied by the French Competition Authority (the amount of which is determined on a case-by-case
basis depending notably on the seriousness of the infringement as well as its duration, but capped at 10% of the worldwide
turnover of the undertaking) could be material to Titan's Group's operating results and cash flows for the periods in which they
are resolved or become reasonably estimable, as well as third party damage claims by private enforcement. In the Acquisition
Agreement, Crown has agreed to indemnify Titan Group for certain losses in connection with this investigation.

In addition to the above legal matter, we are involved in certain other legal proceedings arising in the normal course
of our business. We believe none of these additional legal proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations or cash flows. See “Titan Group is subject to an
_investigation by the European Commission relating to potential anti-competitive behavior and the outcome of this investigation_
_or future investigations could materially adversely affect Titan Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.”_

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING AND GUARANTEE ARRANGEMENTS**

_The following summary of our significant indebtedness does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified_
_by, the underlying documents. Unless otherwise defined in this Offering Memorandum or unless the context requires otherwise,_
_terms defined in the Credit Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement will have the same meanings when used in_
_this section._

**Credit Facilities Agreement**
**_Overview and Structure_**

In connection with the Financing of the Acquisition, Bidco will, on or prior to the Completion Date, enter into the Credit
Facilities Agreement with, among others, Barclays Bank PLC as agent (the “Senior Agent”) and Deutsche Bank AG, London
Branch as security agent (the “Security Agent”), and Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays Bank Ireland PLC, BNP Paribas, Credit

Facilities Agreement will provide for committed facilities in the following amounts:

 - a €1,175.0 million senior secured term loan B facility (the “Term Loan B Facility”); and

 - a €275.0 million senior secured multi-currency revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility” and, together
with Term Loan B Facility, the “Senior Facilities”).

Term Loan B Facility may be utilized by Bidco and may be used (directly or indirectly) (i) to finance or refinance amounts
payable in connection with the Acquisition, (ii) to finance or refinance the payment of any fees, costs, taxes and expenses
related to or incurred or charged in connection with the Acquisition, (iii) to refinance any existing indebtedness of the Target
Group, together with any associated fees, costs, taxes and expenses and/or (iv) for any other purpose contemplated by the tax
structure memorandum or the funds flow statement prepared by Bidco.

The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by Bidco and certain members of the TLB Group (for the purposes of the Credit
Facilities Agreement, the “TLB Group” consists of Bidco and its subsidiaries from time to time, but excluding Unrestricted
Subsidiaries (under and as defined in the Credit Facilities Agreement)) who accede as additional borrowers in euros, sterling,
U.S. dollars and certain other currencies readily available in the relevant interbank market by the drawing of cash advances,
the issue of bank guarantees, standby letters of credit and ancillary and fronted ancillary facilities. The Revolving Credit Facility
may be used (directly or indirectly) for the TLB Group’s working capital and general corporate purposes, including, without
limitation, the refinancing and repayment of existing revolving credit or other workin§ g capital debt and the funding of (i)
capital expenditures, (ii) acquisitions and investments (other than the Acquisition), (iii) operational restructurings and

in connection with any acquisition (including the Acquisition), (v) payment of transaction costs, tax, OID, fees (including any
ticking fees), flex and other financing costs, including VAT thereon and/or (vi) any other purpose contemplated by the tax
structure memorandum and the funds flow statement prepared by Bidco.

In addition to Term Loan B Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility, the Credit Facilities Agreement includes the ability to
incur additional indebtedness (including under one or more additional facilities documented within or outside of the Credit
Facilities Agreement and/or additional Notes and/or other notes) up to an aggregate principal amount equal to the greater of
€270 million and 100% of consolidated pro forma EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facilities Agreement), plus the aggregate
amount of all prepayments of the Senior Facilities and any Senior Secured Indebtedness, debt buy backs, any repayment
following the exercise of “yank the bank” and any other commitment reductions in respect of the Senior Facilities, plus an
unlimited amount, provided that, pro forma for the incurrence of such indebtedness: (i) if such indebtedness constitutes senior
secured liabilities under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Group’s consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio would not
exceed 4.75:1 or, if incurred in connection with a permitted acquisition or other permitted investment, the Group’s consolidated
senior secured net leverage ratio in effect immediately prior thereto; or (ii) if such indebtedness does not constitute senior
secured liabilities under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Group’s fixed charge cover ratio would be at least 2.00:1 or the
Group’s total net leverage ratio would not exceed 6.25x or, in either case, if incurred in connection with a permitted acquisition
or other permitted investment, the Group’s fixed charge cover ratio or total net leverage ratio, as applicable, in effect
immediately prior thereto, in each case, subject to certain other conditions being met.

The Credit Facilities Agreement will also require that certain creditors in respect of secured and unsecured indebtedness
permitted to be incurred under the Credit Facilities Agreement, including pursuant to certain ratio tests and baskets, will be
required to accede to the Intercreditor Agreement to the extent such indebtedness exceeds certain agreed thresholds.


-----

_Availability_

The Term Loan B Facility will be available on and from the date of the Credit Facilities Agreement up to the earlier of: (a) 6
December 2021 or, if earlier, the date which is ten (10) Business Days after the date that is the Longstop Date (as defined in
the Acquisition Agreement, as such date may be extended from time to time with the consent of all the Mandated Lead
Arrangers) or such later date as may be agreed by the Senior Agent (acting on the instructions of all the lenders under the Credit
Facilities Agreement), (b) the date on which Bidco (or KPS) notifies the Mandated Lead Arrangers in writing that the
Acquisition Agreement is terminated by either party thereto in accordance with its terms and (c) the Completion Date.

The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized from the date of the Credit Facilities Agreement until the date which is one
month prior to the maturity date applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility.

_Interest and Fees_

Loans under the Credit Facilities Agreement will bear interest at a variable rate per annum. For loans denominated in dollars,
the rate will be based on the London Interbank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”) until switching on 31 December 2021 to the Secured
Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. For loans denominated in
Sterling or euro, the rate will be based on the Sterling Over Night Index Average Rate (“SONIA”) or the Euro Interbank
Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) respectively. In each case, an applicable margin will be added to the interest rate, which (following
the first full fiscal quarter commencing after the Completion Date) will be subject to a decreasing margin ratchet based on the
Group’s consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio. In addition, the margin applicable to Loans under the Term Loan B
Facility will be subject to a sustainability margin ratchet based on certain key performance indicators in respect of the TLB
Group’s results of operation which is expected to commence in 2022 on or or around the date of the delivery to the Senior
Agent of the Non-Financial Annual Report, as further described in the definitive documentation for the Term Loan B Facility.

If LIBOR, SOFR, SONIA or EURIBOR is less than zero, LIBOR, SOFR, SONIA or EURIBOR (as the case may be) shall be
deemed to be zero in respect of Term Loan B Facility loans and Revolving Credit Facility loans.

A commitment fee will be payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Revolving Credit Facility from
the date of first utilization of the Senior Facilities to the end of the availability period applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility
at a rate of 30% of the applicable margin for the Revolving Credit Facility. Commitment fees will be payable quarterly in
arrear, on the last date of the availability period applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility and, if cancelled in full, on the
cancelled amount of the relevant lender’s commitment at the time the cancellation becomes effective.

Default interest will be calculated as an additional 1% on the defaulted amount.

_Repayments_

Term Loan B Facility will be repaid in full on the date that is seven years from the Completion Date. In respect of the Revolving
Credit Facility, each advance will be repaid on the last day of the interest period relating thereto, subject to an ability to roll
over cash drawings. All outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid on the date falling six and a
half years from the Completion Date. Amounts repaid by the borrowers on loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility
may be reborrowed, subject to certain conditions being met.

The Credit Facilities Agreement will contain a “soft call” whereby lenders under Term Loan B Facility will, subject to
customary carve-outs and exceptions, benefit from a prepayment fee of 1% if Term Loan B Facility is voluntarily refinanced
or amended pursuant to a refinancing transaction (other than in connection with any transaction that would constitute a change
of control, initial public offering or other transformative acquisition) within 6 months of first utilization of the Senior Facilities,
the primary purpose of which is reduce the yield on Term Loan B Facility.

_Voluntary and Mandatory Prepayments_

The Credit Facilities Agreement will permit voluntary prepayments to be made (subject to certain restrictions on the number
of voluntary prepayments permitted to be made and de minimis amounts) and will require mandatory prepayment in full or in
part in certain circumstances, including:

     - on a change of control or an initial public offering which results in a change of control, subject to an individual
lender put option at par;

     - from certain excess proceeds received by Bidco or any guarantor under the Term Loan B Facility from certain asset
disposals, to the extent required to be applied in prepayment of the Senior Facilities and subject to (i) step-downs

-----

     - for each financial year (commencing with the first full financial year commencing after the Completion Date), a
percentage of excess cash flow, subject to (i) step-downs based on the Group’s consolidated senior secured net
leverage ratio and (ii) certain de minimis amounts.

_Guarantees and Security_

Subject to certain agreed security principles and the terms of the Credit Facilities Agreement, the Senior Facilities will benefit
from guarantees and security from certain members of the TLB Group incorporated in The Netherlands, England & Wales,
France, Germany, Italy and Spain which will be limited by reference to certain legal and tax issues.

that, in the event that the aggregate amount of all utilizations under the Revolving Credit Facility (excluding any utilizations
by way of letters of credit, bank guarantees or ancillary facilities or any amounts utilized to fund any
original issue discount or up-front fees incurred in connection with the syndication of the Senior Facilities) exceeds an agreed
percentage of the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility on the relevant testing date, the Group’s consolidated
senior secured net leverage ratio does not exceed an agreed ratio. The financial covenant will be subject to an equity cure
regime.

having a long-term corporate credit rating equal to or better than Baa3 according to Moody’s or BBB- according to S&P’s.

_Events of Default_

The Credit Facilities Agreement will provide for substantially consistent events of default as under the Notes, the occurrence
of which would allow, unless otherwise indicated below, the majority (being 50.1%) of the lenders under the Credit Facilities
Agreement to accelerate all outstanding loans and terminate their commitments (subject in certain cases to agreed grace periods,
financial thresholds, cure rights, clean-up periods and other qualifications) including (i) breach of the financial covenant,
provided that (A) in the event of such breach, only the majority lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility may exercise
acceleration rights as a result of such breach and (B) if the majority lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility have exercised
such acceleration rights as a result of such breach, the remaining lenders shall have a right of cross-acceleration;
(ii) misrepresentation; (iii) invalidity and unlawfulness of the Credit Facilities financing documents; (iv) repudiation and
recession of the Credit Facilities financing documents; (v) breach of material obligations under the Credit Facilities financing

Guarantors (together with any other entity which accedes to the Intercreditor Agreement as a debtor, (the “Debtors”)) and the
Issuer will enter into the Intercreditor Agreement with, among others, the Security Agent and the Senior Agent. On or about
the Issue Date, the Trustee in respect of the Notes will become party to the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor
Agreement is governed by English law and sets out, among other things, the relative ranking of certain debt of the Debtors,
when payments can be made in respect of debt of the Debtors, when enforcement action can be taken in respect of that debt,
the terms pursuant to which certain of that debt will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events and
turnover provisions.

By accepting a Note, the relevant holder thereof shall be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and conditions of,
the Intercreditor Agreement. The following description is a summary of certain provisions contained in the Intercreditor
Agreement which relate to the rights and obligations of the holders of the Notes. It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement
in its entirety. As such, you are urged to read the Intercreditor Agreement because it, and not the discussion that follows, defines
certain rights of the holders of the Notes. Capitalized terms used but not defined in the Certain Definitions section herein have
the meanings given to them in the Intercreditor Agreement.

such liabilities the “Senior Subordinated Guarantee Liabilities”) other than the Senior Subordinated Notes
Trustee Amounts pari passu between themselves and without any preference between them.

The Liabilities owed by any Second Lien Issuer/Borrower (to the extent relating to Liabilities in respect of Second Lien Notes
and/or any agreement documenting a Second Lien Facility (a “Second Lien Facility Agreement”) where that Second Lien
Issuer/Borrower is the issuer or, as the case may be, the borrower of such Liabilities) to the Secured Creditors shall rank pari
_passu in right and priority of payment without any preference amongst them._

The Notes (as defined in the section titled ‘Certain Definitions’) and any additional notes issued from time to time in accordance
with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement shall qualify as Senior Subordinated Notes for purposes of the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Guarantees of the Senior Subordinated Notes shall qualify as Senior Subordinated Guarantee Liabilities.
On the Issue Date of the Senior Subordinated Notes, no Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Second Lien Lender Liabilities or
Second Lien Notes Liabilities will be outstanding. Such Liabilities may only be incurred if not prohibited under the terms of
the relevant finance documents in respect of the Permitted Senior Secured Facilities, Senior Secured Notes, Second Lien
Facilities, Second Lien Notes, Senior Subordinated Facilities, Senior Subordinated Notes, the Senior Subordinated Proceeds
Loan Agreement, the Bilateral Facility Documents, Other Secured Finance Documents, the security documents, any agreement
evidencing the Investor Liabilities or the intra-group liabilities or the Intercreditor Agreement, including, without limitation,
the covenants applicable to the Notes (together the “Debt Documents”).

**_Affected Liabilities and Soulte_**

Notwithstanding the above, the expressions “Hedging Liabilities”, “Senior Secured Liabilities” and “Second Lien
**Liabilities” shall also encompass such liabilities which have become Affected Liabilities from time to time.**

“Affected Liabilities” means in respect of any relevant liabilities, (a) those liabilities which have been extinguished or
discharged in connection with a Foreclosure (as defined below) (other than by payment in cash), (b) those liabilities which
have been released, waived or reduced (including under an abandon de créance or remise de dette) at any time following the
Foreclosure Date (as defined below), (c) those liabilities which have been converted into Investment Instruments at any time
following a Foreclosure, (d) the amount of the Soulte (as defined below) (if any) effectively paid by the Creditors (as defined
below) of those liabilities (or any representative thereof) in connection with a Foreclosure but only to the extent (i) not funded
(at the time of such payment) out of Cash Proceeds (as defined below) allocated in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement
or (ii) not repaid by the relevant payee pursuant to a clawback.

“Cash Proceeds” means (a) all amounts or distributions received in cash by the Foreclosed Assets Holders (as defined below)
in respect of certain Collateral (or assets of companies the shares of which constitute Collateral) foreclosed on by the Secured

(including dividends, interest, repayment of principal or share capital and amounts received in connection with a liquidation or
a winding-up of the issuer of the Foreclosed Assets or in connection with a liquidation or a winding-up of a Secured Parties
SPV) and (b) all proceeds received in cash by Foreclosed Assets Holders as a result of an Exit Disposal (as defined below), in
each case before deducting any liabilities for taxes incurred and required to be paid by Foreclosed Assets Holders in connection
with those distributions but, in the case of either a sale of Foreclosed Assets by a Secured Parties SPV or a sale of shares in any


-----

entity which is a subsidiary of any Debtor whose Investment Instruments are the object of a Foreclosure or the Secured Parties
SPV, after deducting any taxes payable by the seller.

“Soulte” means, in relation to any Foreclosure, the amount by which the value of the Collateral so appropriated or foreclosed
as a result of such Foreclosure (as determined in accordance with the relevant Transaction Security Document) exceeds the
amount of the secured obligations secured under the corresponding Transaction Security Document immediately prior to the
occurrence of such Foreclosure occurring (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include any Assigned Recourse Rights
(as defined below) arising from or in connection with such Foreclosure).

Independent Security Agent under a parallel debt or similar structure).

“Common Collateral” refers to security which is created, or expressed to be created, in favor of the Common Security Agent

any Enforcement Action, other than as expressly permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement.

“Second Lien Issuer/Borrower” means the member of the ICA Group which is the issuer of any Second Lien Notes, or, as

     - the liabilities owed to Topco or any holding company of Topco under any agreement providing a loan (other than
the Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan) from Topco or any holding company of Topco to the Issuer or a subsidiary
of the Issuer or for any amounts to be paid by a member of the Senior Subordinated Group to Topco or any holding
company of Topco (the “Investor Liabilities”), and the liabilities under any Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan

Senior Subordinated Notes or a loan under a Senior Subordinated Facility (a “Senior Subordinated Proceeds
**Loan” and the “Senior Subordinated** **Proceeds Loan Liabilities”) are postponed and subordinated to the**
liabilities owed by the Debtors to the Secured Creditors and the intra-group lenders.

**_Restrictions Relating to Senior Secured Creditor Liabilities_**

The Issuer and the Debtors may make payment on the Senior Lender Liabilities, the Bilateral Facility Liabilities and the Senior
Secured Notes Liabilities (together, the “Senior Secured Creditor Liabilities”) at any time, provided that following a Senior
Distress Event which is continuing, payments may only be made by Debtors and received by creditors which is continuing in

their respective terms from time to time (and subject only to any consent required under them).

by any Senior Secured Creditor with respect to such guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss
are immediately paid to the Common Security Agent and applied in accordance with the provisions set out
under the caption “—Application of Proceeds.”

connection with:

**_Restriction on Enforcement: Senior Secured Creditors_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Senior Secured Creditors may not take action specified in paragraphs (iii),
(iv) or (v) of the definition of Enforcement Action below without the prior written consent of an Instructing Group (as defined

Lien Creditors whose Second Lien Credit Participations aggregate more than 66[2]⁄3% of the total Second Lien Credit
Participations at that time; and (ii) there are Second Lien Notes Liabilities outstanding, Second Lien Lenders and Second Lien
Noteholders whose Second Lien Credit Participations aggregate more than 50% of the total Second Lien Credit Participations

prohibited, the Required Consent has been obtained.

_Permitted Senior Subordinated Payments_

Prior to the Priority Discharge Date, any member of the ICA Group may make payments to the Senior Subordinated Creditors
(in respect of the Senior Subordinated Guarantee Liabilities) or the Issuer (in respect of the Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan

or enforcement of such security;


-----

(iv) unless a Senior Acceleration Event or Senior Secured Notes Acceleration Event has occurred, if the payment is of any

expressed as a percentage of the principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Group Liabilities (or the affected amount
thereof), does not exceed the amount of the corresponding consent and/or waiver fee paid to the Senior Secured Creditors
(when expressed as a percentage of the Senior Secured Liabilities (or the affected principal amount thereof));

(v) following the occurrence of a Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan Event of Default which is continuing, if all or part of
the Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan Liabilities are released or otherwise discharged solely in consideration for the
issues of shares in the Issuer (each, a “Debt for Equity Swap”) provided that no cash or cash equivalent payment is
made in respect of the Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan Liabilities and any Liabilities owed by a member of the ICA
Group to another member of the ICA Group, the Investor or any other holding company of the Issuer that arise as a result

the Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) then due in accordance with the Senior Subordinated Finance
Documents and Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan Agreement (as applicable).

_Payment Blockage Provisions_

Until the Priority Discharge Date, except with the Required Senior Consent, no Debtor shall make, (and the Issuer shall procure
that no other member of the ICA Group will make) and no Senior Subordinated Issuer/Borrower nor any Senior Subordinated
Creditor may receive from any member of the ICA Group, any Permitted Senior Subordinated Payment (other than Senior
Subordinated Agent Amounts) if:

(i) a Priority Payment Default is continuing; or

(ii) a Priority Event of Default (other than a Priority Payment Default) is continuing, from the date which is one Business
Day after the date on which the Common Security Agent (acting on the instructions of an Instructing Group) delivers a
notice (a “Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice”) specifying the event or circumstance in relation to that Priority
Event of Default to any Senior Subordinated Issuer/Borrower and the Senior Subordinated Creditor Representatives until
the earliest to occur of:

(A) the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice;

(B) in relation to payments of Senior Subordinated Group Liabilities, if a Senior Subordinated Standstill Period is in
effect at any time after delivery of that Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice, the date on which that Senior
Subordinated Standstill Period expires;

(C) the date on which the relevant Priority Event of Default has been remedied or waived in accordance with the
applicable Senior Secured Finance Documents or the Second Lien Finance Documents (as applicable);

(D) the date on which the Common Security Agent delivers a notice to each Senior Subordinated Issuer/Borrower and
the Senior Subordinated Creditor Representative(s) cancelling the Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice;

(E) the Priority Discharge Date; and

(F) the date on which the Common Security Agent or any Senior Creditor Representative or Second Lien creditor
representative takes Enforcement Action permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement against a Debtor.

Unless each of the Senior Subordinated Creditor Representatives and each Senior Subordinated Issuer/Borrower waives this
requirement:

(i) a new Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice may not be delivered unless and until 360 days have elapsed since the
delivery of the immediately prior Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice; and


-----

(ii) no Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by the Common Security Agent in reliance on a Priority
Event of Default more than 45 days after the date it received notice of that Priority Event of Default.

The Common Security Agent may only serve one Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice with respect to the same event or
set of circumstances. Subject to the paragraph above, this shall not affect the right of the Common Security Agent to issue a
Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice in respect of any other event or set of circumstances.

No Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice may be served by the Common Security Agent in respect of a Priority Event of
Default which had been notified to the Common Security Agent at the time at which an earlier Senior Subordinated Payment
Stop Notice was issued.

Any failure to make a payment due under the Senior Subordinated Finance Documents or Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan
Agreement as a result of the issue of a Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment
Default or Second Lien Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an event of default as a consequence of that
failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Senior Subordinated Finance Document or Senior Subordinated Proceeds
Loan Agreement; or (ii) the issue of an enforcement notice in respect of an event of default in respect of a Senior Subordinated
Facility or Senior Subordinated Notes (a “Senior Subordinated Enforcement Notice”) on behalf of the Senior Subordinated
Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

No Debtor shall be released from the liability to make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to
accrue) under any Senior Subordinated Finance Document or Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan Agreement by the operation
of the provisions set out under each section above under the caption “—Restrictions relating to Senior Subordinated Notes”
even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time by the terms of any of those provisions.

The accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with the Senior Subordinated Finance Documents or Senior
Subordinated Proceeds Loan Agreement shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a Senior Subordinated Payment Stop
Notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop_

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured
Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default, that Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice ceases to be
outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default ceases to
be continuing; and

(ii) the relevant Debtor then promptly pays to the Senior Subordinated Creditors or the Issuer (in respect of the Senior
Subordinated Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) an amount equal to any payments which had accrued under the Senior
Subordinated Finance Documents or the Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan Agreement (as applicable) and which would
have been Permitted Senior Subordinated Payments but for that Senior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice or Senior
Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default (as the case may be),

then any Senior Subordinated Event of Default (including any cross default or similar provision under any other Debt
Document) which may have occurred as a result of that suspension of payments shall be waived and any Senior Subordinated
Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that Senior Subordinated Event of Default shall be waived, in
each case without any further action being required on the part of the Senior Subordinated Creditors or the Issuer (in respect of
the Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan Liabilities only).

_Restrictions on Amendments and Waivers_

Subject to the following paragraph, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Senior Subordinated Creditors may amend
or waive the terms of the Senior Subordinated Finance Documents (other than the Intercreditor Agreement or any security
document) in accordance with their respective terms at any time, subject to any consent required under them provided that the
terms of the Senior Subordinated Finance Documents as so amended or waived are not prohibited by the terms of the Senior
Secured Finance Documents and the Second Lien Finance Document or if Required Creditor Consent is obtained.


-----

Prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the Issuer and any Senior Subordinated Issuer/Borrower may not amend or waive the
terms of the Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan Agreement if such amendment or waiver would result in the Issuer being
subject to more onerous obligations than those contained in the relevant Senior Subordinated Finance Document (under which
the proceeds of the relevant Senior Subordinated Facility or Senior Subordinated Notes are borrowed or issued to be on-lent)
to which the Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan Agreement relates. This restriction shall not apply if such amendment or
waiver relates to an increase in the applicable margin or coupon payable on the relevant Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan
Agreement (provided that such margin or coupon (as the case may be) may be higher than the margin or coupon payable on
the relevant Senior Subordinated Facility or Senior Subordinated Notes to which the Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan
Agreement relates) to the extent it is customary for such Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan Agreement at the date of
borrowing or issuance thereunder, taking into account the then current market provided that to the extent it is necessary on the
basis of a determination made in good faith by the board of directors of the Issuer (for which it can conclusively rely on the
advice and feedback of its tax advisers).

-----

member of the ICA Group to pay that distribution to the Common Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the Secured

section or if the relevant Security Agent requests that a creditor take that action, undertake that action itself in accordance with
the instructions of the relevant Security Agent or grant a power of attorney to the relevant Security Agent (on such terms as the
relevant Security Agent may reasonably require, although no trustee shall be under any obligation to grant such powers of
attorney) to enable the relevant Security Agent to take such action.

The Independent Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral unless instructed
otherwise by the Majority Senior Subordinated Creditors.

Subject to the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral having become enforceable in accordance with its terms the Majority
Senior Subordinated Creditors may give, or refrain from giving, instructions to the Independent Security Agent to enforce, or
refrain from enforcing, the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral as they see fit.

No Senior Subordinated Secured Party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to enforce, any Senior
Subordinated Notes Collateral or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the security documents governing such Senior
Subordinated Notes Collateral except through the Independent Security Agent.

_Manner of Enforcement—_ _Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral_

If the Notes Collateral is being enforced as set forth above under the caption “—Enforcement Instructions— Senior
Subordinated Notes Collateral”, the Independent Security Agent shall enforce the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral in such
manner (including, without limitation, the selection of any administrator of any Debtor or Senior Subordinated Issuer/Borrower
to be appointed by the Independent Security Agent) as the Majority Senior Subordinated Creditors shall instruct or, in the
absence of any such instructions, as the Independent Security Agent sees fit.

_Exercise of Voting Rights_

The Issuer, each intra-group lender and each Investor agree (to the fullest extent permitted by law at the relevant time) with the
Common Security Agent that it will cast its vote in any proposal put to the vote by, or under the supervision of, any judicial or
supervisory authority in respect of any insolvency, pre-insolvency or rehabilitation or similar proceedings relating to any
member of the ICA Group as instructed by the Common Security Agent. The Common Security Agent shall give instructions
for the purposes of this paragraph as directed by an Instructing Group.

Each Investor to which the Issuer owes any liabilities agrees (to the fullest extent permitted by law at the relevant time) with
the Independent Security Agent that it will cast its vote in any proposal put to the vote by, or under the supervision of, any
judicial or supervisory authority in respect of any insolvency, pre-insolvency or rehabilitation or similar proceedings relating
to the Issuer as instructed by the Independent Security Agent. The Independent Security Agent shall give instructions for the
purposes of this paragraph as directed by the Majority Senior Subordinated Creditors.

_Waiver of Rights_

To the extent permitted under applicable law and subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, each of the
Secured Parties, Senior Subordinated Secured Parties, the Debtors and any Senior Subordinated Issuer/Borrower waives all
rights it may otherwise have to require that the security be enforced in any particular order or manner or at any particular time,
or that any sum received or recovered from any person, or by virtue of the enforcement of any of the security or of any other
security interest, which is capable of being applied in or towards discharge of any of the secured obligations (including Senior
Subordinated Liabilities and Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan Liabilities), is so applied.

_Duties Owed_

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, each of the Secured Parties and the Debtors acknowledges that, in the event that the
Common Security Agent enforces, or is instructed to enforce, any Common Collateral prior to the Senior Secured Discharge
Date, the duties of the Common Security Agent and of any receiver or delegate owed to the creditors in respect of the Second


-----

Lien Liabilities (the “Second Lien Creditors”) in respect of the method, type and timing of that enforcement or of the
exploitation, management or realization of any of that Common Collateral shall (subject to certain provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement) be no different to or greater than the duty that is owed by the Common Security Agent, receiver or
delegate to the Debtors under general law. The duty of care owed (whether under the Intercreditor Agreement or under general
law) by the Common Security Agent to the Second Lien Creditors shall be the same whether or not the Second Lien Creditors
are a creditor of the relevant entity in respect of which Enforcement Action is being taken or are beneficiaries of the security
which is being enforced. The Common Security Agent is obliged to promptly notify the Second Lien Creditors of the scheduling
of any proceedings in relation to any Enforcement Action with respect to the Common Collateral.

Furthermore, each of the Secured Parties and the Debtors acknowledges that, in the event that the Common Security Agent
enforces, or is instructed to enforce, any Common Collateral on or after the Senior Secured Discharge Date but prior to the
Priority Discharge Date, the duties of the Common Security Agent and of any receiver or delegate owed to any Senior
Subordinated Notes finance party in respect of the method, type and timing of that enforcement or of the exploitation,
management or realization of any of that Common Collateral shall (subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement)
be no different to or greater than the duty that is owed by the Common Security Agent, receiver or delegate to the Debtors
under general law.

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any Common Collateral is held by a creditor other than the Common Security Agent, then creditors may only enforce that
Common Collateral in accordance with instructions given by an Instructing Group in accordance with the provisions described
in this section captioned “—Enforcement of Security” (and for this purpose references to the Common Security Agent shall be
construed as references to that creditor).

If any Senior Subordinated Collateral is held by a creditor other than the Independent Security Agent, then creditors may only
enforce that Senior Subordinated Collateral in accordance with instructions given by the Majority Senior Subordinated
Creditors in accordance with the provisions described in this section captioned “—Enforcement of Security” (and for this
purpose references to the Independent Security Agent shall be construed as references to that creditor).

_Consultation Period_

Subject to paragraph the paragraph below, before giving any instructions to the relevant Security Agent to (i) enforce the
security or (ii) take any other Enforcement Action, the Agent(s) of the Creditors represented in the Instructing Group concerned
shall consult with each other Agent and the Security Agent in good faith about the instructions to be given by the Instructing
Group for a period of up to 15 days (or such shorter period as each other Agent and the relevant Security Agent shall agree)
(the “Consultation Period”), and only following the expiry of a Consultation Period, shall the Instructing Group be entitled to
give any instructions to the Security Agent to (i) enforce the security or (ii) take any other Enforcement Action.

No Agent shall be obliged to consult in accordance with the paragraph above and the Instructing Group shall be entitled to give
any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the security or take any other Enforcement Action prior to the end of a
Consultation Period if:

(i) the security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event; or

(ii) the Instructing Group or any Agent of the Creditors represented in the Instructing Group determines in good faith (and
notifies each other Agent and the relevant Security Agent) that to enter into such consultations and thereby delay the
commencement of enforcement of the security would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on:

(A) the relevant Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the security; or

(B) the realization proceeds of any enforcement of the security.

**_Payment of a Soulte and Assignment of Recourse Rights_**

“Foreclosed Asset” means (i) any Collateral foreclosed by Secured Parties following a Foreclosure, (ii) (where such Collateral

Parties SPV.

If following any Foreclosure in connection with the enforcement of any French Law Common Collateral, a Soulte is owed by
the Secured Parties to any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider, that Debtor or Third Party Security Provider agrees that
such Soulte shall only become due and payable by the Secured Parties (which have participated in the relevant Foreclosure pro

enforcement of any Common Collateral governed by French law, on the earlier of;

(i) the date which is 12 months after the date on which such Foreclosure occurs; and

(ii) the date which is two Business Days after the date on which the Security Agent receives Cash Proceeds which are capable
of being applied to the payment referred to in paragraph (x) under “—Order of Application of Common Recoveries”

Security Providers pursuant to a Clawback on or prior to the Final Discharge Date. Such pledge agreement shall include
an irrevocable instruction from the relevant Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make from such Soulte Account
any payment required to be fulfilled under the Intercreditor Agreement or any other Debt Document.

If following any Foreclosure in connection with the enforcement of any Senior Subordinated Collateral, a Soulte is owed by
the Secured Parties to the Senior Subordinated Issuer/Borrower, the Senior Subordinated Issuer/Borrower agrees that such
Soulte shall only become due and payable by the Secured Parties (which have participated in the relevant Foreclosure pro rata

on the earlier of:

(i) the date which is 12 months after the date on which such Foreclosure occurs; and

(ii) the date which is two Business Days after the date on which the Independent Security Agent receives Cash Proceeds
which are capable of being applied to the payment referred to in paragraph (x) under “—Order of Application of
Independent Recoveries” below.


-----

Notwithstanding the above, in the event that any payment of the Soulte in accordance with the foregoing provisions to the

as the Security Agent shall direct; and

(ii) such payment shall not have to be made otherwise than by wire transfer to the credit of the Soulte Account; and

(iii) such payment shall not be made unless and until the Senior Subordinated Issuer/Borrower has granted, to the benefit of
the relevant Secured Parties, a pledge, in form and substance satisfactory to the Independent Security Agent acting on
behalf of the relevant Secured Parties over the Soulte Account as security for any obligation of the Senior Subordinated
Issuer/Borrower under any of the Senior Subordinated Finance Documents including any obligation under the
Intercreditor Agreement to pay back any Independent Recoveries or any amounts to be turned over by the Senior
Subordinated Issuer/Borrower pursuant to a Clawback on or prior to the Senior Subordinated Discharge Date. Such pledge
agreement shall include an irrevocable instruction from the Senior Subordinated Issuer/Borrower to make from the Soulte
Account any payment required to be fulfilled under the Intercreditor Agreement or any other Debt Document.

**_Exit Disposal_**

The taking of any steps towards making an Exit Disposal shall be treated as the enforcement of Collateral for all purposes under
the Intercreditor Agreement where “Exit Disposal” means, following a Foreclosure of certain Foreclosed Assets, a sale, disposal
or transfer of: (a) such Foreclosed Assets, (b) any Investment Instrument issued by a Secured Parties SPV holding such

member of the Group, any guarantor or any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider which has granted any Common Collateral
or a guarantee in order to secure or guarantee all or part of the secured obligations may have against any other person (whether
a Debtor or Third Party Security Provider or not), in each case as a result of an enforcement action of any Transaction Security,
enforcement of that guarantee or otherwise as a result of the payment of such secured obligations in lieu of such other person,
and including any right to be repaid by, to receive any amount from or to be indemnified by, that other person (whether prior
to or after enforcement), any right of recourse by way of subrogation, recours subrogatoire, recours personnel, contribution or
any other similar right, action or claim under any applicable law, whether such right arises by law, contract or otherwise.

Each Debtor which has granted Common Collateral or (if such Debtor is not the Issuer) Senior Subordinated Collateral
governed by French law irrevocably and unconditionally assigns under the Intercreditor Agreement to the Common Security
Agent (or, in respect of Senior Subordinated Collateral, the Independent Security Agent) acting in its name, all Recourse Rights
which it has or may have in the future (the Recourse Rights so assigned being herein referred to as the “Assigned Recourse
**Rights” and Assigned Recourse Rights and the amount thereof at any time being herein referred to as the “Amount of Assigned**
**Recourse Rights”).**

The consideration (the “Assigned Recourse Rights Deferred Consideration”) for the assignment of the Assigned Recourse
Rights shall be equal to the Amount of Assigned Recourse Rights but shall be payable only to the extent and when there are
enough cash proceeds to be applied by the Common Security Agent (in respect of Common Collateral) or the Independent
Security Agent (in respect of Senior Subordinated Collateral) to pay such Assigned Recourse Rights Deferred Consideration
in accordance with the waterfall provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement as described under “Application of proceeds” below.

-----

The relevant Security Agent is irrevocably authorized and instructed without any consent, sanction, authority or further
confirmation from any creditor, Debtor, Third Party Security Provider or Senior Subordinated Issuer/Borrower) that it shall (at
the request and cost of the relevant Debtor, Third Party Security Provider, Senior Subordinated Issuer/Borrower or the Issuer)
promptly release (or procure that any other relevant person releases) from the security and the Secured Debt Documents:

(i) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset which is the subject of:

(A) a disposal not prohibited by the terms of the Debt Financing Agreements (including a disposal to a member of the
Senior Subordinated Group, but without prejudice to any obligation of any member of the Senior Subordinated
Group in a Debt Financing Agreement to provide replacement security); or

(B) any other transaction not prohibited by the terms of the Debt Financing Agreements pursuant to which that asset
will:

(I) cease to be held or owned by a member of the Senior Subordinated Group; and/or

(II) become subject to security which is not prohibited by the Debt Financing Agreements provided such release
is expressly contemplated in the Debt Financing Agreements.

(ii) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any document or other agreement requested in
order for any member of the Senior Subordinated Group to effect any amendment or waiver in respect of that document
or agreement or otherwise exercise any rights, comply with any obligations or take any action in relation to that document
or agreement (in each case to the extent not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement);

(iii) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset of any member of the Senior
Subordinated Group which has ceased to be a Debtor, a Third Party Security Provider or a Senior Subordinated
Issuer/Borrower; and

(iv) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any other asset to the extent that such release is
in accordance with the terms of the Debt Financing Agreements.

For the purpose of the above, in the case of a disposal of shares in a Debtor (or any holding company of any Debtor (other than
a Senior Subordinated Issuer/Borrower)), or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor or Third Party Security Provider
(or any holding company of any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider) will cease to be a member of the Senior Subordinated
Group, the relevant Security Agent shall promptly release (or procure that any other relevant person releases) that Debtor or
Third Party Security Provider (or the relevant Holding Company of that Debtor or Third Party Security Provider) and its
subsidiaries from all present and future liabilities (both actual and contingent) under the Secured Debt Documents or any Senior
Subordinated Proceeds Loan Agreement and the respective assets of such Debtor or Third Party Security Provider and its
subsidiaries (and the shares in any such Debtor and/or Third Party Security Provider and/or subsidiary) from the Security and
the Secured Debt Documents (including any claim relating to a Debt Document and any guarantee liabilities or other liabilities
under the Debt Documents).

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraph (i), (ii) or (iv) in this section above the Issuer shall confirm in
writing to the Security Agent that:

(i) in the case of any release requested pursuant to paragraph (i) or (ii) in this section above, the relevant disposal or other
action is not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement; or

(ii) in the case of any release requested pursuant to paragraph (iv) in this section above, the relevant release is in accordance
with terms of the Debt Financing Agreements;

and the relevant Security Agent shall be entitled to rely on that confirmation for all purposes under the Secured Debt
Documents.

The relevant Security Agent shall (at the cost and expense of the relevant Debtor, Senior Subordinated Issuer/Borrower or the
Issuer but without the need for any further consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor, Debtor, Third
Party Security Provider or Senior Subordinated Issuer/Borrower) promptly enter into (or procure that any relevant person enters
into) and deliver such documentation as the Issuer (acting reasonably) shall require to give effect to any release contemplated
by the provisions described in this section titled “Non-Distressed Disposals” (including the issuance of any certificates of noncrystallization of floating charges, any consent to dealing or any other similar or equivalent document that may be required or
desirable).

If requested by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of any of the Debt Financing Agreements, the relevant Security Agent
and the other creditors shall (at the cost of the relevant Debtor, Third Party Security Provider, Senior Subordinated


-----

Issuer/Borrower and/or the Issuer) promptly execute any guarantee, security or other release and/or any amendment,
supplement or other documentation relating to the relevant security documents as contemplated by the terms of any of the Debt
Financing Agreements (and the relevant Security Agent is authorized to execute, and will promptly execute if requested by the
Issuer, without the need for any further consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor, any such release
or document on behalf of the creditors). The Issuer shall confirm in writing to the relevant Security Agent that such request is
in accordance with the terms of a Debt Financing Agreement and the relevant Security Agent shall be entitled to rely on that
confirmation for all purposes under the Secured Debt Documents.

For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Senior Subordinated Finance Documents or the
Second Lien Finance Documents, if any member of the ICA Group is required or permitted under the Prior Ranking Financing
Agreements to apply the proceeds of any disposal or other transaction in prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or
reduction of any liabilities under such Prior Ranking Financing Agreements:

(i) no such application of those proceeds shall require the consent of any Party or Senior Subordinated Creditor or Second
Lien Creditor or will result in a direct or indirect breach of any Senior Subordinated Finance Document or Second Lien
Finance Document; and

(ii) any such application shall discharge in full any obligation to apply those proceeds in prepayment, redemption or any
other discharge or reduction of any Senior Subordinated Liabilities and Second Lien Liabilities.

The paragraph above is without prejudice to any right of any member of the Senior Subordinated Group to apply any proceeds
of any disposal or other transaction in prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or reduction of any Senior Subordinated
Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities to the extent permitted or contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement or any Prior
Ranking Finance Documents.

_Distressed Disposals and Foreclosures_

A “Distressed Disposal” is a disposal of an asset or shares of a member of the Senior Subordinated Group, or in the case of a
Third Party Security Provider, any assets or shares or financial securities which are subject to the Transaction Security, which
is (a) being effected at the request of an Instructing Group in circumstances where the Common Collateral has become
enforceable in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Documents, (b) being effected by enforcement of the Common
Collateral (other than the exercise of any Ancillary Enforcement Rights) in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security
Documents; or (c) being effected, after the occurrence of a Distress Event, by a Debtor, a Third Party Security Provider or a

Third Party Security Provider.

If a Distressed Disposal or an Exit Disposal or a Foreclosure on any asset is being effected, the Common Security Agent is
irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or further
confirmation from any creditor or Debtor):

(i) to release the Common Collateral or any other claim (including any Assigned Recourse Rights) over that asset which is
the subject of the Distressed Disposal, Exit Disposal or Foreclosure and execute and deliver or enter into any release of
that Common Collateral or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any floating charge or any consent to
dealing that may, in the discretion of the Common Security Agent, be considered necessary or desirable;
(ii) if the asset which is subject to the Distressed Disposal, Exit Disposal or Foreclosure consists of all the shares in the
capital of a Debtor to release:

(A) that Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing liabilities, its guarantee liabilities
and its other liabilities;

(B) any Common Collateral granted by that Debtor or Third Party Security Provider or any subsidiary of that Debtor
or Third Party Security Provider over any of its assets; and

(C) any other claim of an intra-group lender, an Investor, or another Debtor or Third Party Security Provider over that
Debtor’s or Third Party Security Provider’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor or Third Party
Security Provider,

on behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors;


-----

(iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor to release:

(A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of its borrowing liabilities,
its guarantees liabilities and its other liabilities;

(B) any Common Collateral granted by that holding company or any subsidiary of that holding company over any of
its assets; and

(C) any other claim of an intra-group lender, an Investor or another Debtor or Third Party Security Provider over the
assets of that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company,

on behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors and Third Party Security Providers;

(iv) if the asset which is subject to the Distressed Disposal, Exit Disposal or Foreclosure consists of shares in the capital of a
Debtor or the holding company of a Debtor and the Common Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities or the Debtor liabilities owed by that Debtor or holding
company or any subsidiary of that Debtor or holding company:

(A) (if the Common Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not intend that any
transferee of those liabilities or Debtor liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a Secured Creditor or a
Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement), to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement
to dispose of all or part of those liabilities or Debtor liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding any other provision
of any Debt Document, the Transferee shall not be treated as a Secured Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes
of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(B) (if the Common Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend that any
Transferee will be treated as a Secured Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement),
to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all (and not part only) of the liabilities owed to the
Secured Creditors and all or part of any other liabilities and the Debtor liabilities, on behalf of, in each case, the
relevant creditors and Debtors;

(v) if the asset which is subject to the Distressed Disposal, Exit Disposal or Foreclosure consists of shares in the capital of a
Debtor or the holding company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Common Security Agent (acting in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all or any
part of the Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of any subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of the
intra-group liabilities or the Debtor liabilities, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to:

(A) agree to the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or Debtor liabilities
on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to which those obligations are owed and on behalf of the
Debtors which owe those obligations; and

(B) (provided the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also a guarantor of the Senior
Lender Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the Second Lien Lender Liabilities and the Second Lien
Notes Liabilities (the “Priority Secured Liabilities”) to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in
respect of those intra-group liabilities or Debtor liabilities on behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities
to which the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or Debtor liabilities are to be transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal or each Exit Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities or Debtor
liabilities) shall be paid to the Common Security Agent (as the case may be) for application in accordance with the provisions
set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the Common
Collateral and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities or Debtor liabilities has occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities or
Debtor liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal or an Exit Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities) effected by, or at the request of, the Common
Security Agent, the Common Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market
conditions (although the Common Security Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal, Exit
Disposal or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher price).

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors are entitled to give, and have
given, instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Common Security Agent is not authorized to release
any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities owed to any Senior Secured
Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities will be paid (or
repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, Bilateral Facility letter of credit, an ancillary


-----

facility or a Bilateral Facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor),
following that release.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Senior Subordinated Creditors are entitled to give, and
have given, instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Common Security Agent is not authorized to
release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities owed to any Senior
Secured Creditor or any Second Lien Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities and any other Senior
Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating
to a letter of credit, Bilateral Facility letter of credit, an ancillary facility or a Bilateral Facility, made the subject of cash
collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor), following that release.

Where borrowing liabilities in respect of any Senior Secured Liabilities or any Second Lien Liabilities would otherwise be
released pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the creditor concerned may elect to have those borrowing liabilities
transferred to the Issuer or Topco, in which case the Common Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the
relevant Debtor or the Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor)
to execute such documents as are required to so transfer those borrowing liabilities.

Subject to the below paragraph, in the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of Liabilities pursuant to the above paragraph
(iv)(B)) effected by or at the request of the Security Agent (acting in accordance with paragraph falling two paragraphs below),
unless the consent of each Senior Agent and Senior Secured Notes Trustee is otherwise obtained, it is a further condition to
any release, transfer or disposal under the second paragraph of this section “Distressed Disposals and Foreclosures” above that:

     - the proceeds of such disposal are in cash (or substantially all in cash); and

     - such sale or disposal is made:

(A) pursuant to a public auction in respect of which the Secured Creditors are entitled to participate; or

(B) where a Financial Adviser selected by the Common Security Agent has delivered an opinion in respect of
such sale or disposal that the amount received in connection therewith is fair from a financial point of view,
taking into account all relevant circumstances, including the method of enforcement, provided that the
liability of such Financial Adviser may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement
(it being acknowledged that the Common Security Agent shall have no obligation to select or engage any
Financial Adviser unless it shall have been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

If prior to the Second Lien Discharge Date, the Senior Subordinated Discharge Date or the first date on which all Senior
Subordinated Proceeds Loan Liabilities have been discharged (the “Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan Discharge Date”),
a Distressed Disposal or an Exit Disposal is being effected such that the Second Lien Liabilities or the Senior Subordinated
Guarantee Liabilities and/or Common Collateral and/or the Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan Liabilities will be released
pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, it is a further condition to the release that either:

     - the Second Lien Creditor Representative and/or the Senior Subordinated Creditor Representative, and/or a Senior
Subordinated Issuer/Borrower (as applicable) has approved the release; or

     - where shares or assets of a Second Lien Issuer/Borrower or guarantor in respect of Second Lien Liabilities (a
“Second Lien Guarantor”) or Senior Subordinated Guarantor are sold:

(A) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash) and/or other marketable securities
or, if the proceeds of such sale or disposal are not in cash (or substantially in cash) and/ or other marketable
securities, the requirements of paragraph (C)(II) below are satisfied;

(B) all claims of the Senior Secured Creditors and (if applicable) Second Lien Creditors against a member of
the ICA Group (if any), all of whose shares are pledged in favor of the creditors in respect of the Priority
Secured Liabilities (the “Priority Secured Creditors”) are sold or disposed of pursuant to such
Enforcement Action, are unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with
such sale (and are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all security under the security
documents in respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is simultaneously and unconditionally
released and discharged concurrently with such sale, provided that in the event of a sale or disposal of any
such claim (instead of a release or discharge):

(I) where the Senior Secured Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Senior Agent and Senior
Secured Notes Trustee (i) determine, acting reasonably and in good faith, that the Senior Secured


-----

Creditors will recover a greater amount if any such claim was released or discharged, and (ii) serve
a notice on the Common Security Agent notifying the Common Security Agent of the same; and

(II) where the Second Lien Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Second Lien Agent and the
Second Lien Notes Trustee (i) determine acting reasonably and in good faith that the Priority Secured
Creditors (collectively) will recover more than if such claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the
purchaser or one of its Affiliates and not released or discharged, and (ii) serve a written notice on the
Common Security Agent confirming the same to the Common Security Agent;

in which cases the Common Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell and transfer such claim to
such purchaser (or an Affiliate of such purchaser) and the consideration for such sale or transfer may be in
the form of non-cash consideration by way of the Senior Secured Creditors and/or the Second Lien Creditor
(as applicable) bidding by an appropriate mechanic all or part of the Senior Secured Liabilities (such that
the Senior Secured Liabilities would, on completion, be discharged to the extent of an amount equal to the
amount of the offer made by the relevant Senior Secured Creditors); and

(C) such sale or disposal is made:

(I) pursuant to a public auction in respect of which the Secured Creditors are entitled to participate; or;

(II) where a Financial Adviser selected by the Common Security Agent has delivered an opinion in
respect of such sale or disposal that the amount received in connection therewith is fair from a
financial point of view, taking into account all relevant circumstances, including the method of
enforcement provided that the liability of such Financial Adviser may be limited to the amount of its
fees in respect of such engagement (it being acknowledged that the Common Security Agent shall
have no obligation to select or engage any Financial Adviser unless it shall have been indemnified
and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

For the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, “entitled to participate” shall be interpreted to mean that any offer, or
indication of a potential offer, that a holder of any Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities or Senior Subordinated
Liabilities makes shall be considered by those running the Public Auction against the same criteria as any offer, or indication
of a potential offer, by any other bidder or potential bidder. If, after having applied those same criteria, the offer or indication
of a potential offer made by a holder of any Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities or Senior Subordinated
Liabilities is not considered by those running the public auction to be sufficient to continue in the public auction process, such
consideration being against the same criteria as any offer, or indication of a potential offer, by any other bidder or potential
bidder (such continuation may include being invited to review additional information or being invited to have an opportunity
to make a subsequent or revised offer, whether in another round of bidding or otherwise), then the right to participate which a
holder of any Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities or Senior Subordinated Liabilities under the Intercreditor
Agreement shall be deemed to be satisfied.

For the purposes of the first and second bullets above and sub-clauses (iv) and (v) and the second paragraph after sub-clause
(v)(B) above, the Common Security Agent shall act:

     - if the relevant Distressed Disposal is being effected by way of enforcement of the Common Collateral, in
accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “—Manner of Enforcement—Common Collateral” above;
and

     - in any other case, (a) on the instructions of the Instructing Group or (b) in the absence of any such instructions, as
the Common Security Agent sees fit.

Similar provisions to certain of those set out above in relation to the release of Common Collateral will be included in the
Intercreditor Agreement in relation to Other Collateral. The definition of “Other Collateral” will include security granted in
favor of certain other creditors required to accede to the Intercreditor Agreement pursuant to requirements set out in the Credit
Facilities Agreement relating to certain Permitted Alternative Debt, Acquisition Indebtedness and Affected Acquired
Indebtedness (as defined in the Credit Facilities Agreement) and which is secured by assets of the ICA Group.

**_Application of Proceeds_**

For the purposes of this section, “Recoveries” refers, collectively, to (i) Group Recoveries (defined below) and (ii) all amounts
from time to time received or recovered by the Independent Security Agent from or in respect of the Debtors or a Senior
Subordinated Issuer/Borrower pursuant to the terms of any Senior Subordinated Finance Document (other than Common
Collateral or any amounts received or recovered by or on behalf of the Senior Subordinated Creditors from a Distressed
Disposal of the Common Collateral) (the “Independent Recoveries”).


-----

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that Secured Parties and Senior Subordinated Secured Parties may only benefit from
Recoveries (as defined above) to the extent that the liabilities of such Secured Parties and Senior Subordinated Secured Parties
have the benefit of the guarantees or security under which such Recoveries are received and provided that, in all cases, the
rights of such Secured Parties and Senior Subordinated Secured Parties shall in any event be subject to the priorities set out in
this section, and provided further, however, that this shall not prevent the Senior Secured Notes Trustee from claiming and
being paid the Senior Secured Notes Trustee amounts, the Second Lien Agent from claiming and being paid the Second Lien
Agent amounts, the Second Lien Notes Trustee from claiming and being paid the Second Lien Notes Trustee amounts, the
Senior Subordinated Creditor Representative from claiming and being paid the amounts owed to it in respect of the Senior
Subordinated Agent Liabilities or the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee from claiming and being paid the Senior Subordinated
Notes Trustee Amounts. This shall not prevent a Senior Secured Creditor benefiting from such Group Recoveries where it was
not legally possible for the Senior Secured Creditor to obtain the relevant guarantees or security, and shall not affect the
equalization provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement described below under the caption “—Equalization.”

_Order of Application of Common Recoveries_

In this section, “Parent Common Transaction Security” means (a) the security assignment agreement over intercompany
receivables owed to the Issuer by Bidco dated on or about the date of the Intercreditor Agreement between the Issuer and the

_Order of Application of Independent Recoveries_

Subject to certain provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement, all Independent Recoveries shall be held by the Independent
Security Agent on trust, to the extent legally permitted, to apply them at any time as the Independent Security Agent (in its


-----

discretion) sees fit, to the extent permitted by applicable law (and subject to the provisions of this section), in the following
order of priority:

(i) in discharging any sums owing to the Senior Subordinated Creditor Representatives (in respect of the amounts due to the

Facility), the Independent Security Agent, any receiver or delegate on a pari passu basis;

in payment to any other person whom the Independent Security Agent is obliged to pay in priority to the Senior
Subordinated Issuer/Borrower;

(vii) (if the Senior Subordinated Collateral Foreclosure Date has occurred), pro rata and pari passu amongst themselves:

Liabilities which have become Affected Liabilities from time to time.

“Replacement Rate” means in respect of any Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Senior Subordinated
Liabilities which have become Affected Liabilities, a rate per annum which is equal to the highest contractual rate (including
default rate) which was applicable to such liabilities under the relevant Debt Documents on the date such liabilities have become
Affected Liabilities.

To the extent that the recoveries held by the Common Security Agent are insufficient to discharge the liabilities owed to all the
creditors in any priority class and if and to the extent this is due to any creditor whose commitments, other participation rights
(including by way of sub-participation) and/or any other rights and claims under the Debt Documents against an insolvent
German Debtor would be subordinated or subject to potential avoidance claims pursuant to section 39 paragraph 1 no. 5 and/or
paragraph 2 or section 135 of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) or section 6 of the German Avoidance Act
(Anfechtungsgesetz) (an “Equitably Subordinated Creditor”) being part of that class of creditors, amongst others, the recoveries
from German Debtors to be applied by the Security Agent in discharge of the liabilities of that class of creditors shall be


-----

distributed to the other creditors of that class and the Equitably Subordinated Creditor shall not be entitled to receive the
recoveries from German Debtors in discharge of any Equitably Subordinated Liabilities.

**_Sponsor Initiated Sale Process_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if based on the valuation report prepared in connection with the Foreclosure over
the shares in Bidco (the “Bidco Shares Foreclosure”) or the Foreclosure over the shares in Issuer or in any of the Issuers’s
holding companies (the “Parent Guarantor Shares Foreclosure”), in accordance with the terms of the relevant Collateral, or
in two other valuation reports prepared and delivered no more than 30 days after the relevant Foreclosure by different and
independent investment banks of international repute at the request of Topco (and as approved by the Common Security Agent
(in the case of a Bidco Shares Foreclosure) or the Independent Security Agent (in the case of a Parent Guarantor Shares
Foreclosure) acting reasonably), it is shown that the enterprise value (on a debt free/cash free basis) of the relevant Foreclosed
Assets on the relevant Foreclosure Date exceeds:

     - in the case of a Bidco Shares Foreclosure, by ten (10) per cent. the liabilities under the relevant Secured Debt
Documents other than the Senior Subordinated Facility Finance Documents and the Senior Subordinated Notes
Finance Documents (immediately prior to such Foreclosure); or

     - in the case of a Parent Guarantor Shares Foreclosure, by ten (10) per cent. the liabilities under the relevant Secured
Debt Documents,

the Issuer (in the case of a Bidco Shares Foreclosure) or Senior Subordinated Issuer/Borrower (in the case of a Parent Guarantor
Shares Foreclosure) shall be entitled by notice to the Security Agent within one month following the delivery of the relevant
above mentioned valuation report(s) (the “Sale Notice”) to request the Common Security Agent (in the case of a Bidco Shares
Foreclosure) or the Independent Security Agent (in the case of a Parent Guarantor Shares Foreclosure) to launch a process for
the sale of the Foreclosed Assets (a “Sponsor Initiated Sale Process”).

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Sponsor Initiated Sale Process shall be organized and run according to the
following principles:

(a) the Common Security Agent (in the case of a Bidco Shares Foreclosure) or the Independent Security Agent (in the case of
a Parent Guarantor Shares Foreclosure) shall manage all aspects of the Sponsor Initiated Sale Process, including the
appointment of an investment bank or entity (the “Sale Expert”) to carry out an organized private auction process for the sale
of the Foreclosed Assets with a view to obtaining the best price reasonably obtainable provided that the terms and conditions
of the mandate letter of such Sale Expert shall provide for a remuneration scheme whereby such Sale Expert is incentivized to
achieve such result;

(b) the proposed sale will have to provide for the full and immediate repayment in cash of all Outstanding Liabilities (as defined
below) up to the amount required to pay all amounts due under paragraphs (i) to (ix) in the payment waterfall described in
“Order of Application of Common Recoveries” in case of a Bidco Shares Foreclosure or under paragraphs (i) to (vi) in the
payment waterfall described in “Order of Application of Independent Recoveries” in case of a Parent Guarantor Shares
Foreclosure (unless otherwise agreed between the relevant purchaser and the relevant Secured Parties);

(c) no representations and warranties will be granted by the Secured Parties to the buyer save for customary representations
and warranties with respect to the ownership of the Foreclosed Assets to be sold and the absence of Security thereon and that
on the date of the transfer that they have the corporate power to effect that transfer and have taken all necessary action to
authorise the making by them of that transfer;

(d) the Common Security Agent (in the case of a Bidco Shares Foreclosure) or the Independent Security Agent (in the case of
a Parent Guarantor Shares Foreclosure) shall keep and the Issuer (in the case of a Bidco Shares Foreclosure) or Senior
Subordinated Issuer/Borrower (in the case of a Parent Guarantor Shares Foreclosure) informed on a regular basis on the
progress made in respect of the sale process and the relevant Secured Parties and the Issuer (or as the case may be Senior
Subordinated Issuer/Borrower) (which in each case shall be invited to participate in such auction) shall be entitled to involve
any third-party bidder to participate in the auction;

(e) the Sponsor Initiated Sale Process shall be no longer than four months from the launch of the process until the delivery of
the final bids (demonstrated by the execution of a binding commitment for a price enabling the discharge in full of all
Outstanding Liabilities up to the amount required to pay all amounts due under paragraphs (i) to (ix) in the payment waterfall
described in “Order of Application of Common Recoveries” in case of a Bidco Shares Foreclosure or under paragraphs (i) to
(vi) in the payment waterfall described in “Order of Application of Independent Recoveries” in case of a Parent Guarantor
Shares Foreclosure (and, in either case, fully financed with customary certain funds provisions for any debt financing), provided


-----

that the Common Security Agent shall communicate to Topco any non-binding indicative offers delivered in the first round of
consultation launched in respect of such Sponsor Initiated Sale Process, and the Senior Secured Creditors and the Second Lien
Creditors may request the termination of the Sponsor Initiated Sale Process if none of such non-binding indicative offers enables
the discharge in full of all Outstanding Liabilities up to the amount required to pay all amounts due under paragraphs (i) to
(ix) in the payment waterfall described in “Order of Application of Common Recoveries in case of a Bidco Shares Foreclosure
or under paragraphs (i) to (vi) in the payment waterfall described in “Order of Application of Independent Recoveries in case
of a Parent Guarantor Shares Foreclosure;

(f) the Common Security Agent (in the case of a Bidco Shares Foreclosure) or the Independent Security Agent (in the case of
a Parent Guarantor Shares Foreclosure) shall be obliged to sell the Foreclosed Assets to the buyer designated in accordance
with these provisions to the extent only that (x) the sale is completed within seven months of the Sale Notice and (y) all the
relevant Outstanding Liabilities as referred to in the above paragraphs are fully discharged in cash as a result of such sale of
the Foreclosed Assets; and

(g) subject to the foregoing, the Common Security Agent (in the case of a Bidco Shares Foreclosure) or the Independent Security
Agent (in the case of a Parent Guarantor Shares Foreclosure) shall retain the best bid based on the recommendations of the Sale
Expert (taking into account all undertakings, guarantees and indemnities to be given by the Secured Creditors).

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Sponsor Initiated Sale Process may not be initiated more than once.

“Outstanding Liabilities” means the Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the Bilateral Lender
Liabilities, the Second Lien Lender Liabilities, the Second Lien Notes Liabilities and the Senior Subordinated Liabilities (and
the Assigned Recourse Rights relating thereto).

**_Option to purchase: Topco Call Option_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, Topco (or any Holding Company of Topco) may after the taking of any
Enforcement Action by the Secured Parties (or by any person on their behalf), by giving not less than 10 days’ notice to the
relevant Security Agent, (x) require the transfer (a “Outstanding Liabilities Transfer”) to it (or to any person acting on its
behalf it may designate) of all, but not part, of the rights, benefits and obligations in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities,
Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the Bilateral Lender Liabilities, the Second Lien Lender Liabilities, the Second Lien Notes
Liabilities and the Senior Subordinated Liabilities (and the Assigned Recourse Rights relating thereto), (the “Outstanding
**Liabilities”)—or (y) procure the full discharge (by it or any person acting on its behalf it may designate) of such Outstanding**
Liabilities if:

(i) in the case of a Outstanding Liabilities Transfer, that transfer is lawful;

(ii) the relevant Agent, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the Second Lien Notes Trustee and Senior Subordinated Notes
Trustee, on behalf of the relevant Secured Creditors are paid an amount equal to the aggregate of:

(A) all of the Outstanding Liabilities (whether or not due), including (without double counting) all amounts that would
have been payable under the relevant Debt Document if such Outstanding Liabilities were being prepaid by the
relevant Debtors on the date of that payment; and

(B) in the case of a Outstanding Liabilities Transfer, all costs and expenses incurred by the relevant Agent, the Senior
Secured Notes Trustee, the Second Lien Notes Trustee, the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee and/or the relevant
Creditors as a consequence of giving effect to that transfer;

(iii) as a result of that transfer the Secured Creditors have no further actual or contingent liabilities to any Debtor under the
relevant Debt Documents;

(iv) an indemnity is provided from Topco or any of its Holding Companies (or from another third party acceptable to the
Secured Creditors) in a form reasonably satisfactory to each Secured Creditor in respect of all losses which may be
sustained or incurred by any Secured Creditor in consequence of any sum received or recovered by any Secured Creditor
from any person being required (or it being alleged that it is required) to be paid back by or clawed back from any Secured
Creditor for any reason;

(v) in the case of an Outstanding Liabilities Transfer, the transfer is made without recourse to, or representation or warranty
from, the Secured Creditors, except that each relevant Secured Creditor shall be deemed to have represented and
warranted on the date of that transfer that it has the corporate power to effect that transfer and it has taken all necessary
action to authorise the making by it of that transfer; and

(vi) Exercise of Topco’s call option as described in the above paragraphs and subsequent completion of the Outstanding
Liabilities Transfer (and payment of the purchase price) or the relevant discharge of the Outstanding Liabilities shall be


-----

completed not later than the earlier of (x) two months after the Foreclosure Date and (y) the date on which the Secured
Parties or a Secured Parties SPV have initiated a disposal process in respect of the Foreclosed Assets (other than for the
avoidance of doubt a sale to a Secured Parties SPV), provided that such process shall only be deemed to have been
initiated once process letters have been distributed to the bidders and provided further for the avoidance of doubt that if
a notice of exercise of the option has been given in accordance with paragraph (a) above prior to the initiation of a
disposal process, the call option shall be permitted to be completed at the end of the 10 day notice period referred to
above. The Outstanding Liabilities Transfer shall apply to the then outstanding Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured
Notes Liabilities, the Second Lien Lender Liabilities, the Second Lien Notes Liabilities and the Senior Subordinated
Liabilities (including the Affected Liabilities relating thereto).

If Topco has exercised the call option described in the paragraphs above and the relevant transfers have not been completed
within the above mentioned period for any reason attributable to Topco, the right of the relevant entity to request a Sponsor
Initiated Sale Process terminates.

Unless agreed with the relevant hedging counterparty, Topco may only require an Outstanding Liabilities Transfer or procure
the discharge of the outstanding liabilities if, at the same time, it procures the full discharge of the Hedging Liabilities or
requires a full transfer to it of the Hedging Liabilities for consideration in the amount that would have been payable under such
hedging obligations had they been terminated on such date plus certain costs and expenses in connection with any such
purchase.

_Liabilities of the Second Lien Issuer/Borrower_

Subject to certain provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement, all amounts from time to time received or recovered by a Security
Agent from a Second Lien Issuer/Borrower (to the extent relating to Liabilities in respect of Second Lien Notes and/or any
Second Lien Facility Agreement where the Second Lien Issuer/Borrower is the issuer or, as the case may be, the borrower of
such Liabilities) pursuant to the terms of any Second Lien Finance Document (other than in connection with the realization or
enforcement of all or any part of the security) shall be held by the relevant Security Agent on trust to apply them at any time
as the relevant Security Agent (in its discretion) sees fit, to the extent permitted by applicable law in the following order of
priority:

(i) in accordance with paragraph (i) of the provision set out in “—Order of Application of Common Recoveries” above;

(ii) in accordance with paragraph (ii) of the provision set out in “—Order of Application of Common Recoveries” above;

(iii) in accordance with paragraphs (vii) of the provision set out in “—Order of Application of Common Recoveries” above;
and

(iv) the balance in accordance with the provisions set out in “—Order of Application of Common Recoveries” above.

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that each Secured Party authorizes the relevant Security Agent to hold any non-cash
consideration received or recovered in connection with the realization or enforcement of all or any part of the security until
cash is received for any such non-cash consideration, provided that the relevant Security Agent may distribute any such noncash consideration to a Secured Party which has agreed, on terms satisfactory to the relevant Security Agent, to receive such
non-cash consideration and the liabilities owed to that Secured Party shall be reduced by an amount equal to the value of that
non-cash consideration upon receipt by that Secured Party of that non-cash consideration.

**_Equalization_**

Subject to certain other terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, for any reason,
any Senior Secured Liabilities remain unpaid after the Enforcement Date and the resulting losses are not borne by the Senior
Secured Creditors in the proportions which their respective exposures at the Enforcement Date bore to the aggregate exposures
of all the Senior Secured Creditors at the Enforcement Date, the Senior Secured Creditors will make such payments amongst
themselves as the Common Security Agent shall require to put the Senior Secured Creditors in such a position that (after taking
into account such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions. No Equitably Subordinated Lender shall have any
rights or claims in relation to any proceeds received from an insolvent German Debtor or the enforcement of the Transaction
Security provided by such insolvent German Debtor and shall turn over all such proceeds to such Creditors as the Security
Agent shall require.

_Equalization: Soulte payments_

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, for any reason, following a Foreclosure certain Secured Parties have not paid
their share of the corresponding resulting Soulte (if any), such Secured Parties will make such payments amongst themselves


-----

as the Security Agent shall require to put the Secured Parties in such a position that (after taking into account such payments)
the amount paid or payable in respect of such corresponding Soulte is borne by all the Secured Parties having participated in
such Foreclosure in the proportions which their respective Exposures at the date of the Foreclosure bore to the aggregate
Exposures of all such Secured Creditors at the date of the Foreclosure.

**_Additional Debt_**

The Intercreditor Agreement permits, in certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions, for the implementation of any
existing, additional, supplemental or new financing arrangement in respect of any of the liabilities, including by way of
refinancing, replacement, increase or otherwise of any such new, existing, additional, supplemental or new financing
arrangement under such finance documents (each an “Additional Debt Financing”). Such Additional Debt Financing may be
made on a basis which is senior to, pari passu with or junior to any of the other liabilities, may benefit from any or all of the
security or may be unsecured, and may be effected in whole or in part by way of a debt exchange, non-cash rollover or other
similar or equivalent transaction, in each case subject to the terms of the Secured Debt Documents.

Subject to compliance with applicable provisions of the Secured Debt Documents each Party shall be required to enter into any
amendment to or replacement of the then current Secured Debt Documents (including for the purpose of reflecting the terms
and ranking of any Additional Debt Financing in the Secured Debt Documents and/or take such other action as is reasonably
required by the Issuer (in each case at the cost of the Issuer) in order to facilitate any Additional Debt Financing, including in
relation to any changes to, the taking of, or the release coupled with the retaking of, any guarantee or Security, provided that
the Security Agent shall not be required to execute a release of assets from any existing security pursuant to this paragraph
unless the Issuer has confirmed in writing to the Security Agent that it has determined in good faith (taking into account any
applicable legal limitations and other relevant considerations in relation to the Additional Debt Financing) that it is not possible
to implement the Additional Debt Financing by either granting additional security and/or amending the terms of the existing
security. Each Agent and the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized and instructed by each Party (other than the Debtors and
Topco), each Secured Party and each Secured Creditor to execute any such amended or replacement Secured Debt Documents
and/or take such action on behalf of the Parties, the Secured Parties and the Secured Creditors (and shall promptly do so on the
request of and at the cost of the Issuer). Where required to permit the creation of any lower ranking security in connection with
any Additional Debt Financing, the beneficiaries of any Transaction Security will consent in the Intercreditor Agreement to
any such lower ranking security being created for the purpose of such Additional Debt Financing.

The provisions contained in this section shall not operate so as to override any provision in any Debt Financing Agreement
which would (i) require the unanimous consent of any of the Senior Lenders, Bilateral Lenders, Hedge Counterparties, Senior
Secured Noteholders, Second Lien Lenders, Second Lien Noteholders, Senior Subordinated Lenders or Topco Noteholders as
applicable under the terms of any of the Debt Financing Agreements or (ii) expressly require the consent of any individual
affected class of Secured Creditors or any individual affected Secured Creditor under the terms of any of the Debt Financing
Agreements.

**_Required Consents_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, subject to certain exceptions, its terms may be amended or waived only with the
consent of the Issuer and the relevant Agents, provided that, to the extent that an amendment, waiver or consent only affects
one class of Creditors, and such amendment, waiver or consent could not reasonably be expected materially and adversely to
affect the interests of the other classes of Creditors, only written agreement from the agent acting on behalf of the affected class
shall be required.

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, an amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement shall
not be made without the consent of:

(i) if the relevant amendment or waiver (the “Proposed Amendment”) is prohibited by the Credit Facilities Agreement
and/or any Permitted Senior Secured Facility Agreement, the Senior Agent (acting on the instructions of the requisite
Senior Lenders in accordance with the Credit Facilities Agreement);

(ii) if the Proposed Amendment is prohibited by the terms of the relevant Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior
Secured Notes Trustee;

(iii) if any indebtedness has been incurred under a Second Lien Facility Agreement and the Proposed Amendment is
prohibited by the terms of the Second Lien Facility Agreement, the Second Lien Agent (acting on the instructions of
the requisite Second Lien Lenders in accordance with the Second Lien Facility Agreement);


-----

(iv) if any Second Lien Notes have been issued and the Proposed Amendment is prohibited by the terms of the relevant
Second Lien Notes Indenture, the Second Lien Notes Trustee;

(v) if any indebtedness has been incurred under a Senior Subordinated Facility Agreement and the Proposed Amendment
is prohibited by the terms of the Senior Subordinated Facility Agreement, the Senior Subordinated Agent (acting on the
instructions of the requisite Senior Subordinated Lenders in accordance with the Senior Subordinated Facility
Agreement);

(vi) if the Proposed Amendment is prohibited by the terms of the relevant Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture, the Senior
Subordinated Notes Trustee;

(vii) if any indebtedness has been incurred under a Bilateral Facility Document and the Proposed Amendment is prohibited
by the terms of the Bilateral Facility Document, the Bilateral Facility Lender providing that Facility;

(viii) if a hedge counterparty is providing hedging to a Debtor under a hedging agreement, that hedge counterparty (in each
case only to the extent that the relevant amendment or waiver adversely affects the continuing rights and/or obligations
of that hedge counterparty;

(ix) Topco; and

(x) the Issuer.

The Intercreditor Agreement may be amended by the Agents, each Security Agent and the Issuer without the consent of any
other party thereto, to cure defects, omissions or resolve ambiguities or inconsistencies or reflect changes of a minor, technical
or administrative nature.

_Amendments and Waivers: Security Documents_

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, the relevant Security Agent may, if authorized by an
Instructing Group in the case of the Common Collateral or the Majority Senior Subordinated Creditors in the case of the Senior
Subordinated Notes Collateral, and if the Issuer, in the case of the Common Collateral, or any Senior Subordinated
Issuer/Borrower, in the case of the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral, consents, amend the terms of, waive any of the
requirements of or grant consents under, any of the security documents which shall be binding on each party.

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, in the case of any amendment or waiver of, or consent under,
any security document governing the Common Collateral which would adversely affect the nature or scope of the charged
property or the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the Common Collateral are distributed that amendment, waiver
or consent shall require approval in accordance with the provisions set out above under the captions “—Required Consents.”

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, in the case of any amendment or waiver of, or consent under,
any security document governing the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral which would adversely affect the nature or scope
of the charged property or the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral are
distributed that amendment, waiver or consent shall require approval in accordance with the provisions set out above under the
captions “—Required Consents.”

_Exceptions_

Subject to the paragraph below and certain other exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, an amendment, waiver or
consent which adversely relates to the express rights or obligations of an Agent, an arranger or the a Security Agent (in each
case in such capacity) may not be effected without the consent of that Agent or, as the case may be, that arranger or the relevant
Security Agent (as the case may be) at such time.

Neither of the preceding paragraph nor the first paragraph of the section above captioned “—Amendments and Waivers:
Security Documents” shall apply:

     - to any release of security, claim or liabilities; or

     - to any consent,

which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in accordance with the provisions set out in the caption “—Proceeds of Disposals”
above.


-----

_Agreement to Override_

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement overrides anything in the Debt
Documents to the contrary (other than any Transaction Security governed by German Law).

**_Thin Cap Limitations for Certain Guarantees_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other Debt Document,
the aggregate amount of the guarantee liabilities of the Issuer and the guarantee liabilities of the Issuer’s direct and indirect
Subsidiaries in their capacity as guarantors of the secured obligations of Bidco under the relevant Secured Debt Documents
(taken as a whole and taking into account any other guarantee limitations in the relevant Secured Debt Documents) (any such
guarantee from the Issuer or that from any of the Issuer’s direct and indirect Subsidiaries shall be referred to as a “Relevant
**Guarantee”) shall not exceed an amount (the “Relevant Maximum Guaranteed Amount”), which if exceeded would result**
in interest payments not being deductible by Bidco for corporate income tax purposes when compared to the position that would
have been applicable in the absence of such guarantee and indemnity obligations. Any limitation of a Relevant Guarantee to
the Relevant Maximum Guaranteed Amount and any further reduction (if any) of the Relevant Maximum Guaranteed Amount,
pursuant to the foregoing provisions, shall be applied against each Relevant Guarantee in the following priority and order:

(i) first, to the Relevant Maximum Guaranteed Amount of the Issuer (the “Parent Maximum Guaranteed Amount”);
(ii) second, if the Parent Maximum Guaranteed Amount has been reduced to zero, to the Relevant Guarantee of each other
guarantor pro rata to the obligations of each of such guarantors under their respective Relevant Guarantee.

The Intercreditor Agreement will also state that, any reduction in the Relevant Maximum Amount of a Relevant Guarantee
pursuant to the foregoing provisions shall be further applied against the remaining liabilities of the relevant guarantor under its
Relevant Guarantee as follows:

(iii) first, in reduction of the liabilities of the relevant guarantor under its Relevant Guarantee which are not Senior Secured
Liabilities, pro rata the obligations of each of such guarantors under all of their Relevant Guarantees; and

(iv) second, in reduction of the liabilities of the relevant guarantor under its Relevant Guarantee when such liabilities are
Senior Secured Liabilities, pro rata the obligations of such guarantors under all of their Relevant Guarantees.

The Intercreditor will also specify that Common Transaction Security granted by the Issuer over the shares in Bidco and over
receivables held by the Issuer against Bidco (as third party security for the borrowing obligations of Bidco) will not be subject
to the limitations arising from thin capitalization.

**Local Facilities**

**_Trade Receivables Assignment Programme_**

Certain of our affiliates in the Netherlands, France, Belgium and the United Kingdom, and potentially other jurisdictions, intend
to enter into a trade receivables assignment program (the “TRA Programme”) involving the sale of certain receivables of
eligible corporate debtors resident in certain jurisdictions. Our affiliates have signed a mandate letter with a financial institution
in respect of the TRA Programme that is subject to customary conditions to closing. The purchase price for each sale of
receivables will be calculated based on the face value of the receivables, less certain discounts and programme fees. Each sale
will be without recourse against the seller, subject to customary exceptions for a receivables assignment programme of this
type. The maximum aggregate amount of the TRA Programme is expected to be set at GBP 45 million and EUR 105 million
and the TRA Programme is expected to be initially available to purchase receivables for 36 months.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

**General**

In this description, the term “Issuer” refers only to Titan Holdings II, B.V. and not to any of its Subsidiaries, and the terms
“we,” “our,” “us” and “the Company” each refer collectively to the Issuer and its consolidated Subsidiaries. For purposes of
this Description of the Notes, the €375 million of       % senior notes due 2029 are referred to as the “notes.” The notes will
be issued pursuant to a senior notes indenture (the “Indenture”), to be dated as of the Issue Date, among the Issuer, Deutsche
Trustee Company Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”), Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as principal paying agent and
transfer agent, Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A., as registrar, and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as the security agent
(the “Security Agent”). Copies of the Indenture (and any supplemental indentures) may be obtained from the Issuer upon
request after the Issue Date. The notes will be issued in private transactions that are not subject to the registration requirements
of the Securities Act, and the Indenture will not be qualified under or subject to and will not incorporate (by reference or
otherwise) any of the provisions of, the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. Application will be made for the notes
to be listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”) and for permission to be granted to deal
in the notes on the Official List of the Exchange. There can be no assurance that this application will be accepted.

The following summary of certain provisions of the Indenture, the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Charge, the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Security Documents and the notes does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to, all the provisions of the Indenture, the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Charge, the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Security Documents and the notes, including the definitions of certain terms therein. Capitalized terms used in
this “Description of the Notes” section and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Indenture.

The Issuer will issue the notes with an initial aggregate principal amount of €375 million. Following the Issue Date, the Issuer
may issue additional notes from time to time as described below under “—Additional Notes.”

This offering is currently expected to be consummated prior to the consummation of the Acquisition. If this offering does close
prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement (the “Escrow Agreement”), to be
dated as of the Issue Date, among the Issuer, the Trustee and an escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”), the gross proceeds of the
offering of the notes will be deposited into an escrow account (the “Escrow Account”) with the Escrow Agent. The Escrow
Agreement, including the conditions to the release of the escrowed proceeds, are more fully described below under “—Escrow
_of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” In the event the Acquisition has not been consummated on or before October_
22, 2021 (the “Escrow Longstop Date”), or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the notes will be redeemed at a price
equal to 100% of the initial issue price of the notes and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the
Issue Date to, but not including, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”). See
“—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

If a holder has given wire transfer instructions to the Issuer or a Paying Agent, the Paying Agent will deliver payment of all
principal, interest and premium, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, on that holder’s notes in accordance with those
instructions. All other payments on the notes will be payable, and the notes may be exchanged or transferred, at the office or
agency of a Paying Agent as specified in the Indenture unless the paying agent elects to make interest payments by check
mailed to the holders at their addresses set forth in the register of holders.

The notes will be issued only in fully registered form, without coupons, in denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples
of €1,000 in excess thereof. Notes in denominations of less than €100,000 will not be available.

**Brief Description of the Notes and the Guarantees**

The notes will be:

- general senior secured obligations of the Issuer;

- secured as set forth under “—Security; Intercreditor Agreement;”

- equal in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s existing and future Indebtedness and other obligations that are not, by their
terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes;

- effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured Indebtedness and other obligations of the Issuer and its
subsidiaries that are secured by assets that do not secure the notes, or that are secured on a first-priority basis over assets
that secure the notes on a second-priority basis (including the Indebtedness Incurred under the Credit Agreement and
certain Hedging Obligations), to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness or such other obligations,
and to any creditor having a preferred claim by operation of law, to the extent of the value of such preferred claim; and


-----

- structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other obligations of the Issuer’s existing and future Subsidiaries that do
not Guarantee the notes as set forth under “—Guarantees”, including obligations to trade creditors.

The Guarantees of each Guarantor in respect of the notes will be:

- a general senior subordinated obligation of such Guarantor;

- secured as set forth under “—Security; Intercreditor Agreement;”

- equal in right of payment to all of such Guarantor’s existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness that is not
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Guarantees;

- subordinated in right of payment to any of such Guarantor’s existing and future Senior Indebtedness, including its
guarantee under the Credit Agreement and certain Hedging Obligations;

- effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured Indebtedness and other obligations of such Guarantor that are
secured by assets that do not secure its guarantee or that are secured on a first-priority basis over assets that secure the
Guarantees on a second-priority basis (including the Indebtedness Incurred under the Credit Agreement and certain
Hedging Obligations), to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness or such other obligations, and
to any creditor having a preferred claim by operation of law, to the extent of the value of such preferred claim; and

- structurally subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of subsidiaries of such Guarantor that do not Guarantee
the Notes, including obligations to trade creditors.

At March 31, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had €1,550 million of total
indebtedness outstanding, including €1,175 million of secured indebtedness outstanding, excluding lease liabilities, nonrecourse factoring transactions, unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs and €275 million of undrawn availability under
our revolving credit facility (without giving effect to letters of credit that may be issued under our revolving credit facility).

Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the issuance of Disqualified Stock by the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries and the issuance of Preferred Stock by the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries, such limitation is subject to
a number of significant qualifications and exceptions. Under certain circumstances, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
may be able to incur substantial amounts of Indebtedness, and such Indebtedness may be secured Indebtedness. The Indenture
will not limit the amount of Indebtedness that any direct or indirect parent company of the Issuer may incur or the incurrence
of liabilities that do not constitute Indebtedness. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—The substantial indebtedness
_of Titan Group could materially adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations and prevent it from_
_fulfilling its obligations under its indebtedness,” “—Certain Covenants—Liens” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on_
_Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.”_

The Guarantees are senior subordinated indebtedness, which means that, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,
the Guarantees rank behind, and are expressly subordinated to, all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantors,
including any obligations under the Credit Agreement and any other Indebtedness ranking pari passu with or senior to such
Indebtedness incurred after the Issue Date. The ability to take enforcement action against the Guarantors is subject to significant
restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement, and potentially any Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after
the Issue Date. In addition, the Guarantees and the collateral securing the notes are subject to release under certain
circumstances, including, but not limited to, the sale of the TLB Borrower or a Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to an enforcement
of security over shares of the TLB Borrower or a Restricted Subsidiary taken by the Security Agent acting at the direction of
an instructing group of senior secured creditors. See “Description of Certain Financing and Guarantee Arrangements—The
_Intercreditor Agreement”. It is therefore likely that holders of Senior Indebtedness and other creditors (including trade creditors)_
of the Guarantors would recover disproportionately more than the holders of the notes recover in any insolvency or similar
proceeding relating to such entity. In any such case, there may be insufficient assets, or no assets, remaining to pay the principal
of or interest on the notes after the repayment in full of all Senior Indebtedness. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—
_Investors’ right to receive payments on the Notes and Guarantees is contractually and effectively subordinated to certain of_
_Titan Group’s indebtedness and obligations, including borrowings under the Credit Facilities Agreement, possible future_
_borrowings as well as indebtedness and obligations of Titan Group’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes”_

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

On the Issue Date and as of the Acquisition Closing Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. In the
circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the Issuer will be permitted to
designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the
restrictive covenants in the Indenture.


-----

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

Concurrently with the closing of the offering of the notes on the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into the Escrow Agreement
with the Trustee and the Escrow Agent, pursuant to which the Initial Purchasers will deposit with the Escrow Agent an amount
equal to the gross proceeds of this offering of the Notes. The initial funds deposited in the Escrow Account, and all other funds,
securities, interest, dividends, distributions and other proceeds and payments credited to the Escrow Account, including any
interest earned on the amounts held in the Escrow Account (less any proceeds and/or funds paid in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement) are referred to, collectively, as the “Escrowed Proceeds.”

In order for the Issuer to cause the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Proceeds to the Issuer (the “Release”), the Escrow
Agent and the Trustee shall have received from the Issuer, on or before the Escrow Longstop Date, an Officer’s Certificate,
upon which both the Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall be entitled to rely absolutely without further investigation, to the
effect that all of the following conditions have been met or will be satisfied on or prior to the Business Day immediately
following the Escrow Longstop Date:

(1) (i) the Acquisition will be consummated promptly upon release of the Escrowed Proceeds and (ii) since the Issue Date,
no material term or condition of the Acquisition Agreement has been amended or waived in a manner or to an extent that
would be materially prejudicial to the interests of holders, other than any amendment or waiver made with the consent
of holders of a majority of the outstanding notes; and (2)as at the date of such Officer’s Certificate, there is no Default
or Event of Default with respect to the Issuer under clause (6) or (11) of the first paragraph under the heading titled
“Events of Default” below.

The Release will occur promptly upon the receipt of such Officer’s Certificate. Upon the Release, the Escrowed Proceeds will
be paid out in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and the Escrow Account will be reduced to zero.

In the event that (a) the satisfaction of the conditions set forth above does not take place on or prior to the Escrow Longstop
Date, (b) in the reasonable judgment of the Issuer, the Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior to the Escrow Longstop
Date, (c) the Acquisition Agreement terminates at any time on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date or (d) there is a Default
or an Event of Default with respect to the Issuer under clause (6) of the first paragraph under the heading titled “Events of
_Default” below on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date (the date of any such event being the “Special Termination Date”),_
the Issuer will redeem all of the notes (the “Special Mandatory Redemption”) at a price (the “Special Mandatory
**Redemption Price”) equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional**
Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to but excluding the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below) (subject to
the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

Notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Issuer, no later than one Business Day following the
Special Termination Date, to the Trustee and the Escrow Agent, and will provide that the Notes shall be redeemed on a date
that is no later than the fifth Business Day after such notice is given by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Date”). On the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent
shall pay to the Principal Paying Agent for payment to each holder the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such holder’s
notes and, concurrently with the payment to such holders, deliver any excess Escrowed Proceeds (if any) to the Issuer. Notice
of such Special Mandatory Redemption shall be given to the holders of the notes at least five Business Days before the Special
Mandatory Redemption Date.

In the event that the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory Redemption exceeds the
amount of the Escrowed Proceeds, one or more of the Sponsors will, pursuant to a commitment provided by such Sponsors, be
required to fund the difference between the Special Mandatory Redemption Price and the amount of the Escrowed Proceeds to
cover the accrued and unpaid interest, and Additional Amounts, if any, owing to the holders of the Notes and any negative
interest charged on the Escrow Account (the “Equity Commitment Letter”). See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Acquisition—If the Acquisition is not completed, you may not obtain the return that you expect on the Notes.” The Holders will_
not have any right to enforce the Equity Commitment Letter, and must rely on the Issuer’s sole right to enforcement under the
Equity Commitment Letter.

To secure the payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price, the Issuer will grant to the Trustee for the benefit of the
holders (by virtue of a parallel debt arrangement set forth in the Indenture) a first-ranking security interest over the Escrow
Account pursuant to an escrow charge dated the Issue Date between the Issuer and the Trustee (the “Escrow Charge”). Receipt
by the Trustee of a notice of Special Mandatory Redemption or the occurrence of the Release shall each constitute deemed
consent by the Trustee for the release of the Escrowed Proceeds from the Escrow Charge.


-----

If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and the rules of
the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange that the Special Mandatory Redemption has occurred and of any
relevant details relating to such Special Mandatory Redemption. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as paying agent
or registrar in respect of the notes.

No provisions of the Escrow Agreement or the Escrow Charge and, to the extent such provisions relate to the Issuer’s obligation
to redeem the Notes in a Special Mandatory Redemption, the Indenture, may be waived or modified in any manner materially
adverse to the holders without the consent of holders of a majority of the outstanding notes. By accepting a note, each holder
will be deemed to have agreed to be bound by the terms of the Escrow Agreement and have irrevocably authorized the Trustee
to take all the actions set forth in the Escrow Agreement without the need for further direction from them under the Indenture.

**Security; the Collateral**

Pursuant to the Security Documents to be entered into on or prior to the Completion Date, the notes have been or will be secured
by:

(1) on a first-ranking basis, a pledge of (i) the shares held in the Issuer by Topco, (ii) the receivables owed to Topco by the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer in respect of any shareholder loan and (iii) the material bank accounts
of the Issuer (together the “Notes Priority Collateral”); and

(2) (to the extent the same secures the Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement on a first-ranking basis) on a second-ranking
basis, (i) a pledge of the shares held in the TLB Borrower by the Issuer and (ii) a pledge of the structural loan receivables
owed by the TLB Borrower to the Issuer (if any),

(together the “Collateral”), to the extent legally possible and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, any thin capitalization or
tax restrictions, any legal or corporate benefit restrictions and the Agreed Security Principles. All Collateral shall be subject to
the operation of the Agreed Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens. See “—Guarantees.” See also “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

On the Issue Date, the notes and the obligations under the Indenture will also be secured by first-priority security interests over
the Escrowed Proceeds pursuant to the Escrow Charge (the “Escrow Collateral”). See ‘‘—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
_Mandatory Redemption.’’ The Escrowed Proceeds that is deposited in the Escrow Account will not be charged to secure any_
obligations other than the Issuer’s obligations under the notes. Upon the definitive release of the Escrowed Proceeds in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement and the Escrow Charge, the first-priority security over such Escrowed Proceeds will
be released.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Collateral and the guarantees may be limited or capped and certain assets will not be pledged
in relation to the notes (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, including (without
limitation):

  - if providing such security or guarantee would be prohibited or limited by general legal or statutory limitations,
regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, equitable subordination, foreign
exchange laws or regulations (or analogous restrictions), transfer pricing, earnings stripping, controlled foreign
corporation, thin capitalization, exchange control restrictions and capital maintenance rules, tax restrictions, retention
of title claims, employee consultation or approval requirements and similar matters or providing such guarantee or
security would not be within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group or conflict with the fiduciary or
statutory duties of their directors or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual prohibition or restriction
or have the potential to result in a material risk of personal or criminal liability of any director or officer of any member
of the Group after the use of reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on
relationships with third parties) to overcome such obstacles;

  - if the time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration taxes,
registration fees, legal fees, notarial costs or any other fees, costs, commissions or expenses directly associated with
the granting of the guarantee or security) of providing the guarantee or security (and in respect of the security, the
extent of its perfection and/or registration) is not proportionate to the benefit accruing to the secured parties of
obtaining such guarantee or security;


-----

- if a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets and the cost involved in creating security over
the immaterial assets is not proportionate to the benefit of such security, only the material assets in that category will
be subject to security;

- if in certain jurisdictions it may be either impossible or impractical to grant a guarantee or create security over certain
categories of assets, the guarantee will not be granted and/or security will not be taken over such assets;

- if any assets are subject to legal requirements, contracts, leases, licenses or any other third party arrangements which
may prevent those assets from being pledged or subject to the applicable guarantee (including requiring a consent of
any third party, minority shareholders, supervisory board or works council (or equivalent)) or where providing such
security or guarantees would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or
obligations with respect to any member of the Group in respect of those assets or as a result such guarantees or require
any of them to take any action materially adverse to the interests of the Group provided that the relevant member of
the Group will use commercially reasonable endeavors to obtain any necessary consent to pledge any such assets or
provide such guarantee if the Security Agent (acting in good faith) specifies prior to the date of the security document
that a relevant asset or guarantee is material and the Issuer in consultation with the relevant Obligor is satisfied that
such endeavors will not involve placing relationships with third parties in jeopardy, or otherwise, will be excluded
from any relevant security or guarantee;

- any requirement for any member of the Group to use reasonable endeavors (or similar) to comply with or to effect any
action, including to grant, perfect or confirm any guarantee or security or to obtain a consent, agreement or permission,
shall apply for a period no longer than 60 days (or such shorter period as may be specified) and, if following the expiry
of such 60 day (or shorter) period, the relevant member of the Group has been unable to comply or to effect such
action, such requirement shall cease to apply;

- if providing such security, perfecting such security or granting such guarantee (i) would not be customary under
relevant local law or (ii) would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Issuer or any Subsidiary to conduct
its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture, or materially adversely
affects the tax arrangements of the Issuer or such Subsidiary, and any requirement under the Agreed Security
Principles to seek consent of any person or take or not take any other action shall be subject to this principle;

- if security over such assets or guarantee from such person is required to support acquired indebtedness to the extent
such acquired indebtedness is not restricted by the Indenture, or if the terms of the documentation governing such
acquired indebtedness prevents the granting of such security or guarantee;

- to the extent possible and unless required by applicable law, there should be no action required to be taken in relation
to the guarantees or security with respect to any transfers or assignments by the secured parties and no member of the
Group (nor any holding company of any member of the Group) shall bear or otherwise be liable for any taxes, any
notarial, registration or perfection fees or any other costs, fees or expenses that result from any assignment or transfer
by a secured party;

- any security document shall only be required to be notarized or notarially certified if required by law in order for the
relevant security to become enforceable or admissible in evidence;

- no security document shall be governed by the laws of a jurisdiction other than a security jurisdiction, which are
France, Germany, Italy, Spain, England & and Wales, The Netherlands and the jurisdiction of incorporation of an
entity that has acceded as an additional guarantor (the “Security Jurisdictions”);

- (i) all security interests (other than as set forth in subclause (ii) below) over an asset shall be governed by the law of
the jurisdiction of incorporation in which that asset is located provided that (i) where the asset comprises a contract, a
security interest may be governed by the governing law of that contract and (ii) except where it is inappropriate under
applicable laws, share security over any subsidiary will be governed by the law of the jurisdiction of incorporation of
that subsidiary;

- (i) no security documents governed by, or perfection actions under, the law of a jurisdiction other than a Security
Jurisdiction shall be required and (ii) in respect of the same assets, security documents and perfection actions may not
be required in more than one Security Jurisdiction;


-----

  - in the case of security from or guarantees over, or over assets of, any joint venture or similar arrangement, any minority
interest or any member of the Group that is not wholly-owned by another member of the Group;

  - no notices shall be required to be sent to insurers, third party debtors or other contractual third parties prior to a
Declared Default that is continuing;

  - in the case of assets subject to security which is a Permitted Lien; and

  - no control agreements or perfection by control or similar arrangements will be required with respect to any deposit
accounts, securities accounts or other assets.

The Collateral (other than the Escrow Charge and the Notes Priority Collateral) will also secure, on a first-priority basis,
liabilities under the Credit Agreement, hedging agreements and certain other future Indebtedness.

Each Security Document shall contain a clause which records that: (i) if there is a conflict between the Security Document and
the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement then (to the extent permitted by law and
to the extent it would not prejudice the creation, priority, perfection, validity or enforceability of the Security created under the
transaction security documents) the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, as applicable, shall take priority over the provisions of the Security Document; and (ii) notwithstanding any
provision of a Security Document, the terms of the Security Documents shall not operate or be construed so as to prohibit or
restrict something which would otherwise be permitted under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of
_Security Interest,” the Collateral may also secure other Indebtedness, including on a basis senior to, junior to or pari passu with_
the notes, and the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with
future issuances of their Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, including any additional
notes, in each case, as permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing
_and Guarantee Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens” below. The enforcement of the_
Security Documents will be subject to the procedures set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. In general, the rights of the
Security Agent (acting on its own behalf or on behalf of the holders of the notes) to take enforcement action under the Security
Documents in respect of the Collateral will be subject to certain standstill provisions, payment blockage and other limits on
enforcement. The ability to enforce may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is
secured by the Collateral in compliance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Certain
_Financing and Guarantee Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”. The proceeds from enforcement of the Collateral may not_
be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the holders of the notes.

The Collateral or, in relation to clause (6) below, the Escrowed Proceeds, may be released, and the Security Agent and the
Trustee shall take any action required to effectuate any release of the Collateral (without the consent of the holders of the notes,
and at the request and expense of the Issuer) as required by the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security
Documents:

# 1. if a Guarantor is released from its Guarantee pursuant to the Indenture, the release of the property and assets of, and
Capital Stock of, such Guarantor;

# 2. if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary following release of the property
and assets and Capital Stock of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

# 3. in connection with any transaction permitted under the covenant described under “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale
_of All or Substantially All Assets” or, other than with respect to the pledge of the shares held in the Issuer, upon a_
disposition not prohibited by the provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—Asset Sales;”

# 4. pursuant to an IPO Pushdown permitted by the Indenture;

 5. other than with respect to the Notes Priority Collateral, upon the release of the security interest securing such Collateral
under the Credit Agreement (other than in connection with discharge of the obligations thereunder) or in accordance
with the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Liens” if the indebtedness that gave rise to the obligation to
grant the Lien over such Collateral in favor of the notes is released;


-----

# 6. in relation to the Escrow Charge, upon release of the Escrowed Proceeds in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement and the Escrow Charge;

# 7. upon the defeasance or discharge of the notes as provided in “—Defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge,” in
each case, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;

# 8. as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver;”

 9. as described under “—Impairment of Security Interest;”

10. as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

# 11. in connection with a Permitted Parent Reorganization; and

 12. as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

**Impairment of Security Interest**

Topco and the Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take any action that would have the result of
materially impairing the security interest with respect to the Collateral or the Escrow Collateral (it being understood that the
Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security interest with
respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders, and the Issuer and Topco shall not, and shall not permit
any Guarantor to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders and the other
beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Escrow Charge, any Lien over any of the Collateral or the Escrow
Collateral that is prohibited by the covenant entitled “Certain Covenants—Liens;” provided, that the Issuer and any Guarantor
may Incur any Lien over any of the Collateral that is not prohibited by the covenant entitled “Certain Covenants—Liens,”
including Permitted Collateral Liens, and the Collateral may be discharged, transferred or released in any circumstances not
prohibited by the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the applicable Security Document.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this covenant shall restrict the discharge and release of any Lien in accordance with
the Indenture, the Escrow Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable,
pursuant to the incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens or any action expressly permitted by the Indenture, the Escrow
Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable. Subject to the foregoing, the
Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or released (followed
by a substantially concurrent retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets) to (i) cure any ambiguity,
omission, defect or inconsistency therein; (ii) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens; (iii) add to the Collateral; (iv) effect a
Permitted Parent Reorganization or (v) make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the holders in any material
respect as determined by the Issuer in good faith and evidenced by an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee; provided,
however, that (except where permitted by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or to effect or facilitate the creation of Permitted Collateral Liens for the benefit of the Security Agent and holders
of other Indebtedness Incurred in accordance with the Indenture), no Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed,
restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or released (followed by a substantially concurrent retaking of a lien of at least
equivalent ranking over the same assets), unless contemporaneously with such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement or modification or release (followed by a substantially concurrent retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking
over the same assets), the Issuer delivers to the Security Agent and the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, from an Independent Financial Advisor or investment bank of international
standing which confirms the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions
related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or release (followed by a substantially
concurrent retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), (2) a certificate from the principal financial
or accounting officer of the Issuer or the Board of Directors which confirms the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification, replacement, or release or (3) an opinion of counsel (subject to any qualifications customary for this
type of opinion of counsel), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to
any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or release (followed by
a substantially concurrent retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), the Lien or Liens created under
the Security Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or released and replaced are valid
and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such
Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
modification or replacement and to which the new Indebtedness secured by the Permitted Collateral Lien is not subject.


-----

In the event that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries comply with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the
Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such actions without the need for
instructions from the holders.

**Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

In connection with the Incurrence of any Indebtedness by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (i) that is not prohibited
by the Indenture to be Incurred pursuant to the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and either to share in the Collateral or to_
rank pari passu or junior in right of payment to the notes or senior, pari passu or junior to any Guarantee, or (ii) the proceeds
of which are used, in whole or in part, to refinance the notes or Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (i), the Trustee
and the Security Agent shall, at the request and expense of the Issuer and without the consent of the holders, enter into with the
Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries and the holders of such Indebtedness (or their representatives) one or more
intercreditor agreements or deeds (including a restatement, replacement, amendment or other modification of the Intercreditor
Agreement) (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”), on substantially similar terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or
terms that are not materially less favorable to the holders), including substantially similar terms as applies to sharing of the
proceeds of security and enforcement of security, priority and release of security and guarantees; provided that such Additional
Intercreditor Agreement will not, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent (as applicable), impose any personal
obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or adversely affect the personal rights, duties, powers, liabilities, indemnification
or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement. As used herein, a
reference to the Intercreditor Agreement also includes any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

In relation to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee shall consent on behalf of the holders to the payment, repayment,
purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the notes thereby;
provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant described herein under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Restricted Payments.”_

The Indenture will also provide that, at the written direction of the Issuer and without the consent of holders, the Trustee and
the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement: (1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) to increase
the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such Intercreditor Agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or its
Restricted Subsidiaries that is subject to any such Intercreditor Agreement (provided that such Indebtedness is Incurred not in
violation of the Indenture), (3) to add Guarantors or other Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement, (4) to further
secure the notes (including additional notes permitted to be Incurred in compliance with the Indenture), (5) to make provision
for pledges of the Collateral to secure additional notes or to implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (6) to facilitate a
reorganization otherwise permitted by the Indenture, (7) as permitted by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or (8) to
make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the holders of notes in any material respect. The
Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement
without the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding, except as otherwise
permitted below under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” or as permitted by the terms of such Intercreditor Agreement,
and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee or Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does
not, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent (as applicable), impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security
Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, powers, liabilities or
immunities under the Indenture or any Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that each holder, by accepting a note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms
and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered
into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and the Security Documents and to have authorized and instructed
the Trustee and the Security Agent to act on its behalf to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents (and any amendment, restatement or modification thereto as contemplated above), on
each holder’s behalf.

A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available to the holders upon
request and will be made available for inspection during normal business hours on any Business Day upon prior written request
at the office of the Issuer.


-----

**Proceeds Loan**

On the Completion Date, the Issuer will loan the proceeds of the offering of notes issued on the Issue Date to the TLB Borrower
(the “Proceeds Loan”) pursuant to a proceeds loan agreement (the “Proceeds Loan Agreement”). The Proceeds Loan
Agreement will provide that the TLB Borrower will pay to the Issuer interest and principal as it becomes payable on the notes
(including any additional amounts due thereunder). The Proceeds Loan will bear interest at a rate at least equal to the interest
rate of the notes and interest on the Proceeds Loan will be payable semi-annually in arrear at least one, and no more than five,
Business Days prior to the corresponding interest payment under the notes. Principal payments of the Proceeds Loan will be
payable at least one, and no more than five, Business Days prior to a corresponding payment of the Issuer to redeem or defease
the notes or as consideration payable under a Change of Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer (each as defined below), each in
accordance with the Indenture. The terms of the Proceeds Loan Agreement will permit the prepayment of all such loans in
whole or in part at any time. As a result, the initial amount of the Proceeds Loan and such on-lending may be reduced, potentially
to zero, prior to the maturity of the Notes. Payments by the TLB Borrower and any subsequent borrower under the Proceeds
Loan will be subject to significant restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing
_and Guarantee Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” The Proceeds Loan will be pledged on a second ranking basis as_
part of the Collateral to secure the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the notes (with the indebtedness under
the Credit Agreement being secured on a first ranking basis).

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a “Paying Agent” and, collectively, the “Paying Agents”) for the
notes in London, United Kingdom (the “Principal Paying Agent”). The principal paying agent will be Deutsche Bank AG,
London Branch.

The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a “registrar” and, collectively, the “registrars”) for the notes. The
registrar for the notes will be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. The registrar will maintain a register on behalf of the Issuer for
so long as the notes remain outstanding reflecting ownership of notes outstanding from time to time (the “Register”). The
registrar will send a copy of the Register to the Issuer on the Issue Date. The Issuer will also maintain a transfer agent. The
transfer agent for the notes will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch. The paying agent will make payment on, and the
transfer agent will facilitate transfers of, notes on behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change the principal paying agent, registrar or transfer agent without prior notice to the holders of the notes.
However, for so long as the notes are listed on the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the
Exchange of any change of the Paying Agent, registrar or transfer agent. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as paying
agent or registrar in respect of the notes.

**Terms of the Notes**

The notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer and will mature on       , 2029. Each note will bear interest at a
rate of        % per annum from the Issue Date or from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or provided for
payable semi-annually to holders of record at the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the interest
payment date on        and        of each year, commencing        . Interest on the Notes will accrue from the date of
original issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year comprised with twelve 30-day months on the aggregate principal amount outstanding.

The rights of holders to receive the payments of interest on such notes are subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect of any notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment
is due to be paid, the holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day
at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**Additional Notes**

From time to time, subject to compliance with the covenants described under the headings “—Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens”,_
the Issuer is permitted to issue additional notes, which shall have terms substantially identical to the notes except in respect of
any of the following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered by the Issuer to the Trustee (“additional
**notes”):**

(1) the title of such additional notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such additional notes;


-----

(3) the date or dates on which such additional notes will be issued;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such additional notes shall bear interest and, if applicable, the
interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such interest rate or rates, the date or dates from which such
interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on which such interest shall be payable or the method by which such
dates will be determined, the record dates for the determination of holders thereof to whom such interest is payable and
the basis upon which such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such additional notes shall be denominated and the currency in which cash or
government obligations in connection with such series of additional notes may be payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms and conditions upon
which, such additional notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) if other than in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, the denominations in
which such additional notes shall be issued and redeemed; and

(8) the ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification numbers with respect to such additional notes.

At the Issuer’s election, additional notes may be established in one or more supplemental indentures to the Indenture in lieu of
an Officer’s Certificate.

Such additional notes may, at our election, be treated, along with all other notes, as a single class for the purposes of the
Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically distinguished for such series.
Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of the Notes”, references to “notes”
shall be deemed to include references to the notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well as any additional notes. Additional
notes may also be designated to be of the same series as the notes initially issued on the Issue Date, but only if they have terms
substantially identical in all material respects to such initial notes. However, in order for any additional notes to have the same
ISIN, CUSIP or common code, as applicable, as the notes initially issued on the Issue Date, such additional notes must be
issued with no more than de minimis original issue discount or be fungible with the initial notes for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.

**Optional Redemption**

On and after      , 2024, the Issuer may redeem the notes, at its option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time,
upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice sent electronically or mailed by first-class mail to each holder’s
registered address or provided otherwise in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, at
the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, plus
Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), if redeemed during the 12-month period commencing
on        of the years set forth below:

**Redemption**

**Period** **Price**

2024 ..................................................................................................................
%

2025 ..................................................................................................................
%

2026 and thereafter ..........................................................................................
100.000%

In addition, at any time prior to      , 2024, the Issuer may redeem the notes at its option, in whole at any time or in part
from time to time, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice sent electronically or mailed by first-class mail to
each holder’s registered address or provided otherwise in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium and accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time and from time to time prior to      , 2024, the Issuer may redeem in the aggregate
up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the notes (calculated after giving effect to any issuance of any additional
notes) in an aggregate amount not exceeding the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings by the Issuer or any direct


-----

or indirect parent of the Issuer, to the extent the amount of the net cash proceeds thereof are contributed to the common or
preferred equity capital (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer or used to purchase Capital Stock (other than Disqualified
Stock) of the Issuer from it, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount thereof) of par plus       %
plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the redemption date (subject to the right of
holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however,
that at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the notes (calculated after giving effect to any issuance of
additional notes) remain outstanding immediately after each such redemption; and provided, further, that such redemption shall
occur within 180 days after the date on which any such Equity Offering is consummated upon not less than 10 nor more than
60 days’ notice provided to each holder of notes being redeemed and otherwise in accordance with the procedures set forth in
the Indenture.

At any time prior to      , 2024, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice sent electronically or mailed by
first-class mail to each holder’s registered address or provided otherwise in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear or
Clearstream, the Issuer may at its option from time to time redeem during each twelve-month period commencing with the
notes Issue Date up to 10% of the original aggregate principal amount of the notes (calculated after giving effect to any issuance
of any additional notes) at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus the Additional
Amounts, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the applicable redemption date (subject to the right
of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

In connection with any redemption of notes (including with funds in an aggregate amount not exceeding the amount of the net
cash proceeds of an Equity Offering, Incurrence of Indebtedness, Change of Control or other transaction), any such redemption
may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including the completion of any related Equity
Offering or other transaction. In addition, if such redemption or notice is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions
precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed (without the need for a
new redemption notice) until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in its sole
discretion), or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions
shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed and/or that such notice may be
rescinded at any time by the Issuer if the Issuer determines in its sole discretion that any or all of such conditions will not be
satisfied (or waived). For the avoidance of doubt, if any redemption date shall be delayed as contemplated by this paragraph
and the terms of the applicable notice of redemption, such redemption date as so delayed may occur, subject to the applicable
procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, at any time after the original redemption date set forth in the applicable notice of
redemption and after the satisfaction (or waiver) of any applicable conditions precedent, including, without limitation, on a
date that is less than 10 days after the original redemption date or more than 60 days after the applicable notice of redemption.
In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Issuer’s
obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

Subject to applicable federal and state securities laws, the Issuer or its affiliates may at any time and from time to time purchase
notes or our other indebtedness. Any such purchases may be made through open market or privately negotiated transactions
with third parties or pursuant to one or more tender or exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as well
as with such consideration as the Issuer or any such affiliates may determine, which may be more or less than the consideration
for which the notes offered hereby are being sold.

Neither the Trustee, the paying agent, the registrar, the transfer agent, nor any of their respective agents shall have any
responsibility or liability for any actions taken or not taken by Euroclear or Clearstream.

**Additional Amounts**

All payments made under or with respect to the notes or any Guarantee will be made free and clear of and without withholding
or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any
deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of (1) any jurisdiction in which
the Issuer or any Guarantor is then incorporated, established or resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or
governmental authority thereof or therein having power to tax or (2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment is made
by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including, without limitation, the jurisdiction of any Paying Agent for the notes)
or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein (each, a “Tax Jurisdiction”), is required to be made
from any payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer under or with respect to the notes or by or on behalf of the Guarantors
under or with respect to any Guarantee, including, without limitation, payments of principal, redemption price, purchase price,
interest or premium, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, will, subject to Optional Redemption for Tax Reasons,
pay or indemnify, as applicable, such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the
net amounts received in respect of such payments by each holder of the notes after such withholding or deduction (including


-----

any withholding or deduction from such Additional Amounts), or after the payment of the relevant indemnity, will equal the
respective amounts that would have been received in respect of such payments in the absence of such withholding or deduction;
provided, however, that no Additional Amounts will be payable for or on the account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been imposed or withheld but for the existence of any present or former connection
between the holder of the relevant notes (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner, member or shareholder of,
or possessor of power over, the relevant holder, if the relevant holder is an estate, trust, nominee, partnership, limited
liability company or corporation) or the beneficial owner of the relevant notes and the relevant Tax Jurisdiction
(including, without limitation, being or having been a citizen, resident or national thereof or being or having been
incorporated therein, present or engaged in a trade or business or maintaining a permanent establishment therein), other
than any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of any note or the enforcement or receipt
of payment under or in respect of any note, the Indenture or any Guarantee; or

(2) any Taxes imposed or withheld as a result of the failure of a holder or beneficial owner of the relevant notes to comply
with any written request, made to that holder or the holder on behalf of that beneficial owner in writing at least 15 days
before any such withholding or deduction would be payable, by the Issuer or any of the Guarantors: (a) to provide timely
or accurate information or evidence concerning the nationality, domicile, establishment, residence or identity of such
holder or beneficial owner or (b) to make any valid or timely declaration or similar claim or satisfy any certification
information or other reporting requirements, which, in each case sub (a) and (b), is required or imposed by a statute,
treaty, regulation or officially published administrative practice of the relevant Tax Jurisdiction as a precondition to
exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, such Taxes, but, in each case, only to the extent
that the holder or beneficial owner is legally eligible to provide such declaration, certification or other information; or
(3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld as a result of the presentation of any note for payment
(where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the
holder or beneficial owner of the notes (except to the extent that such holder or beneficial owner would have been entitled
to Additional Amounts on account of such Taxes had the note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period); or
(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, excise, personal property or similar Tax; or

(5) any Tax which is payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment made under or with respect to the
notes or any Guarantee; or

(6) any Tax imposed or withheld pursuant to the Dutch withholding tax act 2021 (Wet bronbelasting 2021), as amended, on
payments due to a holder of notes affiliated to the Issuer (within the meaning of the Dutch Withholding Tax Act 2021 as
published in the Official Gazette (Staatsblad) Stb. 2019, 513 of 27 December 2019); or

(7) any Tax imposed or withheld on or with respect to any payment if such holder of the notes is not the beneficial owner of
such payment, to the extent that the beneficial owner of the payment would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts
with respect to such payment had such beneficial owner been the holder of such note; or

(8) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld in connection with the presentation of any note for payment by or on behalf of a
holder or beneficial owner of such notes who would have been able to avoid such Taxes by presenting the relevant note
to, or accepting payment from, another Paying Agent; or
(9) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the “Code”), any regulations promulgated thereunder, any official interpretations thereof, any fiscal
or regulatory legislation, rules or official practices adopted pursuant to an intergovernmental agreement between a nonU.S. jurisdiction and the United States with respect to the foregoing sections of the Code or any agreements entered into
pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code; or

(10) any combination of items (1) through (9) above.

In addition to the foregoing, the Issuer and the Guarantors will pay (and indemnify the holder of the notes for) any present or
future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary Taxes, or any other excise or property Taxes, charges or similar levies
imposed by a Tax Jurisdiction on the execution, issuance, delivery, registration or enforcement of any of the notes, the Indenture
or any Guarantee (other than on or in connection with a transfer of the notes other than (i) a transfer of the notes to the Issuer
or the depositary or (ii) the initial sale by the Initial Purchaser) or any other document or instrument referred to therein or the
receipt of any payment with respect thereto (limited, solely in the case of Taxes attributable to the receipt of any payment with
respect thereto, to any such Taxes imposed or withheld in a relevant Tax Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses
(1) through (4) and (6) through (8) or any combination thereof).

If the Issuer or any Guarantor, as the case may be, becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with
respect to any payment under or with respect to the notes or any Guarantee, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case
may be, will deliver to the Trustee on a date at least 15 days prior to the date of payment (unless the obligation to pay Additional


-----

Amounts arises after the 45th day prior to that payment date, in which case the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor shall notify the
Trustee promptly thereafter) an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount
estimated to be so payable. The Officer’s Certificate must also set forth any other information reasonably necessary to enable
the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts on the relevant payment date. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such
Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will make all withholdings and deductions required by law to be made by them and will
remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Issuer or the
relevant Guarantor will furnish to the Trustee, within a reasonable time after the date that the payment of any Taxes so deducted
or withheld is made, certified copies of Tax receipts evidencing payment by the Issuer or a Guarantor, as the case may be, or
if, notwithstanding such entity’s efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not obtained, other evidence of payments by such entity
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee. Such copies or such other evidence of payment shall be made available to the holders
upon reasonable written request.

Whenever the Indenture or this “Description of the Notes” mentions the payment of amounts based on the principal amount,
interest or any other amount payable under, or with respect to, any of the notes or any Guarantee, such mention shall be deemed
to include, without duplication, the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts
are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The above obligation will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any transfer by a holder or
beneficial owner of its notes, and will apply, mutatis mutandis, to any jurisdiction in which any successor Person to the Issuer
or any Guarantor is then incorporated, organized, engaged in business or resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or
through which payment is made by or on behalf of such person on the notes (or any Guarantee) and any political subdivision
or governmental authority thereof or therein.

**Optional Redemption for Tax Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the notes, in whole but not in part, at its discretion at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more
than 60 days’ prior notice to the holders (which notice will be irrevocable and given in accordance with the procedures described
in “—Selection”), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the date fixed by the Issuer for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) and all Additional Amounts (if any)
then due and that will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise (subject to the right
of holders on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is prior to the Tax Redemption
Date and Additional Amounts (if any) in respect thereof), if on the next date on which any amount would be payable in respect
of the notes or any Guarantee, the Issuer or any Guarantor is or would be required to pay Additional Amounts (but, in the case
of the relevant Guarantor, only if such amount payable cannot be paid by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can pay such
amount without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor cannot avoid any such
payment obligation by taking reasonable measures available to it, including the appointment of a different paying agent
(provided that changing the jurisdiction of the Issuer or Guarantor is not a reasonable measure for purposes of this section), as
a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations, protocols or rulings promulgated thereunder) of
a Tax Jurisdiction affecting taxation which change or amendment is announced and becomes effective on or after the
date of this offering memorandum (or, if the relevant Tax Jurisdiction was not a Tax Jurisdiction on the date of this
offering memorandum, the date on which such Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction under the Indenture); or

(2) any change in, or amendment to, the existing official position or the introduction of an official position regarding the
application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations, protocols or rulings (including a holding,
judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published practice), which change, amendment,
application or interpretation is announced and becomes effective on or after the date of this offering memorandum (or, if
the relevant Tax Jurisdiction was not a Tax Jurisdiction on the date of this offering memorandum, the date on which such
Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction under the Indenture) (each of the foregoing clauses (1) and (2), a “Change
**in Tax Law”).**

The Issuer will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer or the
relevant Guarantor would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect of the notes or Guarantees
were then due, and unless at the time such notice is given, the obligation to pay Additional Amounts remains in effect.

Prior to the publication or, where relevant, sending of any notice of redemption of the notes pursuant to the foregoing, the
Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that there has been such Change in Tax Law which would


-----

entitle the Issuer to redeem the notes hereunder. In addition, before the Issuer publishes or sends notice of redemption of the
notes as described above, it will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate to the effect that the obligation to pay Additional
Amounts cannot be avoided by the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor taking reasonable measures available to it.

The Trustee will accept such Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel as conclusive evidence of the existence and
satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders of
the notes.

**Mandatory Redemption**

Except as set forth above and under the caption “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” the Issuer will not
be required to make any other mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the notes.

**Selection**

In the case of any partial redemption, selection of the notes for redemption will be made on a pro rata basis by use of a pool
factor in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable; provided that no such selection shall result
in a holder of notes with a principal amount of notes less than the minimum denomination for the notes as set forth in the sixth
paragraph of this “Description of the Notes.” Neither the Trustee, the Paying Agent nor the Registrar shall be liable for
selections made in accordance with this paragraph. If any note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption relating
to such note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. A new note in principal amount equal to the
unredeemed portion thereof will be issued in the name of the holder thereof upon cancellation of the original note. On and after
the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on notes or portions thereof called for redemption so long as the Issuer has
deposited with the paying agent funds sufficient to pay the principal of, plus accrued and unpaid interest (if any) on, the notes
to be redeemed.

**Guarantees**

Subject to any thin capitalization or tax restrictions, any legal or corporate benefit restrictions and the Agreed Security
Principles, (i) on the Issue Date, the TLB Borrower, (ii) on or about the Completion Date, any Restricted Subsidiary of the TLB
Borrower incorporated in a Security Jurisdiction and that has been established for the purposes of the Acquisition, and
(iii) within 90 days following the Completion Date and pursuant to the covenant described below under “—Certain
_Covenants—Future Guarantors,” each of the Issuer’s other Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Borrower or a Guarantor (each as_
defined in the Credit Agreement) under the Credit Agreement, in each case, will jointly and severally irrevocably and
unconditionally provide a guarantee in relation to the notes or to the benefit of holders of the notes on a senior subordinated
basis for the performance and punctual payment when due, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of the
obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the notes, whether for payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on
the notes, expenses, indemnification or otherwise (all such obligations guaranteed by such Guarantors being herein called the
“Guaranteed Obligations”). As of the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Guarantors represented approximately
65% of EBITDA of the Target Business, approximately 75% of net sales of the Target Business and approximately 76% of the
total assets (excluding goodwill) of the Target Business. Prior to the Completion Date, the Issuer and its Subsidiaries will not
control any Guarantor that will be acquired in connection with the Acquisition, and none of such Guarantors will be subject to
the covenants described in this Description of the Notes. As such, we cannot assure you that prior to the Completion Date, such
Guarantors will not engage in activities that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had those covenants been
applicable to such entities after the Issue Date and prior to the Completion Date. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the
_Acquisition— The Issuer does not control Titan Group until the consummation of the Acquisition.”_

Each Guarantee will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles and contractually limited as it relates to its Guarantor, to
reflect limitations under the Agreed Security Principles and applicable law with respect to, among other things, maintenance
of share capital, legal or corporate benefit, thin capitalization, tax restrictions, fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance and
other legal restrictions applicable to such Guarantor and its shareholders, directors and general partners. See “Security; the
_Collateral.” By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts_
payable with respect to the notes or could even be equal to or reduced to zero. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes”
and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations.”_


-----

Each Guarantee will be a continuing guarantee and, subject to the next succeeding paragraph, shall:

(1) remain in full force and effect until payment in full of all the Guaranteed Obligations;

(2) be binding upon each such Guarantor and its successors; and

(3) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Trustee, the holders and their successors, transferees and assigns.

A Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon:

(a) the sale, disposition, exchange or other transfer (including through merger, consolidation, amalgamation, dividend,
distribution or otherwise) of the Capital Stock of such Guarantor if after such sale, disposition or other transfer, such
Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary, or the sale, disposition or other transfer of all or substantially all the assets
of such Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each case if such sale, disposition, exchange or
other transfer is made in a manner not in violation of the Indenture,

(b) (i) the Issuer designating such Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the provisions set forth
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” and the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary” or (ii)
such Guarantor becoming an Excluded Subsidiary in accordance with the definition of “Excluded Subsidiary” (unless
such subsidiary continues to provide a guarantee under the Credit Agreement),

(c) upon the release or discharge of the guarantee of the Credit Agreement;

(d) in the case of any Restricted Subsidiary that is required to guarantee the notes pursuant to the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantors,” the release or discharge of the obligation by such Restricted Subsidiary of
Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary or the repayment of
the Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock, in each case, which resulted in the obligation to guarantee the notes, except if a
release or discharge is by or as a result of payment in connection with the enforcement of remedies under such other
obligation and a Default or Event of Default would occur thereby,

(e) the Issuer’s exercise of its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described under “—Defeasance,”
or if the Issuer’s obligations under the Indenture are discharged in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, including
as described under “––Satisfaction and Discharge”,

(f) the merger or consolidation of such Guarantor with and into the Issuer or another Guarantor that is the surviving Person
in such merger or consolidation, or upon the liquidation or dissolution of such Guarantor following the transfer of all or
substantially all of its assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor,

(g) as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver,”

(h) as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement and/or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,

(i) pursuant to or as contemplated by “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets” or “—IPO
Pushdown”,

(j) upon the release or discharge of all other Guarantees by such Guarantor of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any other
Guarantor, or

(k) the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event; provided that following a Reversion Date, if any, each Guarantor shall
be reinstated to the extent and within the timeframe required under “––Certain Covenants––Future Guarantors.”

Unless a Subsidiary is a Guarantor, claims of creditors of such Subsidiary, including trade creditors, and claims of preferred
stockholders (if any) of such Subsidiary, generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such Subsidiary
over the claims of creditors of the Issuer, including the holders of the notes. The notes, therefore, will be structurally
subordinated to holders of indebtedness and other creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred or minority stockholders
(if any) of any Subsidiary of the Issuer that is not a Guarantor.

**Change of Control**

Upon the occurrence of any of the following events after the Completion Date (each, a “Change of Control”), each holder will
have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part of such holder’s notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101%
of the principal amount thereof (the “Change of Control Payment”), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding,
the date of repurchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant


-----

interest payment date), except to the extent the Issuer has previously or concurrently elected to redeem the notes as described
under “—Optional Redemption”:

(1) the sale, lease or transfer, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all the assets of the Issuer and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to a Person other than any of the Permitted Holders, a Restricted Subsidiary or an IPO
Entity, provided that a Change of Control under this clause (1) shall not be deemed to have occurred if such Change of
Control is also a Specified Change of Control Event; or

(2) the Issuer becomes aware (by way of a report or any other filing pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, proxy,
vote, written notice or otherwise) of the acquisition by any Person or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or
Section 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act, or any successor provision), including any group acting for the purpose of
acquiring, holding or disposing of securities (within the meaning of Rule 13d-5(b)(1) under the Exchange Act), other
than any of the Permitted Holders, in a single transaction or in a related series of transactions, by way of merger,
consolidation, amalgamation or other business combination or purchase of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of
Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, or any successor provision), of more than 50% of the total voting power of the
Voting Stock of the Issuer, or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer that holds directly or indirectly an amount of
Voting Stock of the Issuer such that the Issuer is a Subsidiary of such holding company unless the Permitted Holders
have, at such time, the right or the ability by voting power, contract or otherwise to elect or designate at least a majority
of the members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer (provided that, for purposes of this determination, to the extent
any Person or group includes both Permitted Holders and non Permitted Holders (any such Person or group, the “Subject
**Group”), and the Subject Group does not itself constitute a Permitted Holder, then the Voting Stock of the Issuer directly**
or indirectly beneficially owned by such Permitted Holders in such Subject Group shall not be treated as being
beneficially owned by such Subject Group), provided, further, that (i) no Change of Control shall be deemed to occur by
reason of the Issuer becoming a Subsidiary of (x) an IPO Entity or (y) another Person so long as, in the case of this
subclause (y), the Permitted Holders beneficially own Voting Stock representing in the aggregate a majority of the total
voting power of the Issuer or successor Parent and (ii) a Change of Control under this clause (2) shall not be deemed to
have occurred if such Change of Control is also a Specified Change of Control Event; or

(3) Topco ceases to directly own, legally and beneficially, 100% of the issued and outstanding Capital Stock of the Issuer,
provided, that no Change of Control shall be deemed to occur under this clause (3) by reason of a Permitted Parent
Reorganization.

Notwithstanding the foregoing: (A) the transfer of assets between or among the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall not
itself constitute a Change of Control and (B) a Person or group shall not be deemed to have beneficial ownership of securities
subject to a stock purchase agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement (or voting or option agreement related thereto)
prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by such agreement.

In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction in which a parent entity of the Issuer becomes a subsidiary of another
Person (such Person, the “New Parent”) shall not constitute a Change of Control if (a) the equityholders of the Issuer or such
parent entity immediately prior to such transaction beneficially own, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries,
at least a majority of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of such New Parent immediately following the consummation
of such transaction, substantially in proportion to their holdings of the equity of such parent entity prior to such transaction or
(b) immediately following the consummation of such transaction, no Person, other than a Permitted Holder, the New Parent or
any subsidiary of the New Parent, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, more than 50%
of the voting power of the Voting Stock of the Issuer.

Within 30 days following any Change of Control, except to the extent that the Issuer has exercised its right to redeem the notes
as described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Issuer shall send electronically, mail by first-class mail or otherwise provide
in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, a notice (a “Change of Control Offer”) to each
holder with a copy to the Trustee describing:

(1) that a Change of Control has occurred and that such holder has the right to require the Issuer to purchase such holder’s
notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
to but excluding the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the
relevant interest payment date);

(2) the transaction or transactions constitute a Change of Control;

(3) the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is sent, except
that if a Change of Control Offer is made in advance of a Change of Control and conditioned upon such Change of
Control as stated below, the expected repurchase date will be stated and may be based on a date relative to the closing of


-----

the transaction that is expected to result in the Change of Control and may be tolled until the closing of such transaction)
(the “Change of Control Payment Date”); and

(4) the instructions determined by the Issuer that a holder must follow in order to have its notes purchased.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the
Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture
applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under
such Change of Control Offer or (2) notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under the
caption “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price.

A Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, and conditioned upon such Change of Control,
with a purchase date to occur upon, or within a specified period of time not to exceed 15 days after, the consummation of such
Change of Control.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14(e)-1 of the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of such covenant, the Issuer will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this paragraph by
virtue of such compliance.

Debt agreements to which the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a party may prohibit the Issuer from purchasing
any notes as a result of a Change of Control. In the event a Change of Control occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited
from purchasing any notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to permit the purchase of such notes or could attempt
to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings,
the Issuer will remain prohibited from purchasing the notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered notes would
constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.

The Credit Agreement will, and future credit agreements or other debt agreements to which the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
becomes a party may, provide that certain change of control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default
thereunder (including a Change of Control under the Indenture). If we experience a change of control that triggers a default
under our Credit Agreement or such other Indebtedness, we could seek a waiver of such defaults or seek to refinance our Credit
Agreement or any other Indebtedness. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Credit Agreement and such
other Indebtedness, such defaults could result in amounts outstanding under our Credit Agreement and such other Indebtedness
being declared due and payable.

If holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes validly tender and do not withdraw such
notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as
described above, purchases all of the notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party
will have the right, upon not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days’ prior notice; provided that such notice is given not more
than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all notes that remain
outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price in cash equal to the applicable Change of Control Payment plus, to
the extent not included in the Change of Control Payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of
redemption.

Our ability to pay cash to the holders of notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our thenexisting financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases.
See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—The Credit Facilities Agreement, the Notes and other indebtedness provide
_that certain change of control events constitute an event of default. In the event of a change of control, Titan Group may not_
_be able to satisfy all of its obligations under the senior secured credit facilities or other indebtedness.”_

The Change of Control purchase feature of the notes may in certain circumstances make it more difficult or discourage a sale
or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of
negotiations between the Initial Purchasers and us. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change
of Control, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we
could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would
not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such
time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—The Credit
_Facilities Agreement, the Notes and other indebtedness provide that certain change of control events constitute an event of_


-----

_default. In the event of a change of control, Titan Group may not be able to satisfy all of its obligations under the senior secured_
_credit facilities or other indebtedness.”_

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase
“substantially all” under New York law, which governs the Indenture, there is no precise established definition of the phrase
under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control with respect to the notes has occurred and whether a
holder of the notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the notes as described above.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the notes as a result of a
Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the
notes.

If and for so long as the rules of the Exchange require, the Issuer will publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer
as required by such rules.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants contained in the Indenture.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date (i) the notes have Investment Grade Ratings from two Rating Agencies and (ii) no
Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture (the occurrence of the events described in the foregoing clauses
(i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a “Covenant Suspension Event”), the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will
not be subject to the following covenants or provisions (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

(1) “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock;”

(2) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments;”

(3) “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries;”

(4) “—Asset Sales;”

(5) “—Transactions with Affiliates;”

(6) the provisions of clause (4) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “––Merger, Consolidation or Sale of
_All or Substantially All Assets;” and_

(7) “—Future Guarantors.”

In the event that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture for
any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) one or both of the relevant
Rating Agencies withdraw their Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the rating assigned to the notes below an Investment
Grade Rating, then the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under
the Indenture with respect to future events.

The period of time between the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event and the Reversion Date is referred to in this
description as the “Suspension Period.” Additionally, upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event, the amount of
Excess Proceeds from Net Cash Proceeds shall be reset at zero. In the event of any such reinstatement on a Reversion Date, no
action taken or omitted to be taken by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such Reversion Date (and no
action taken or omitted to be taken following a Reversion Date in connection with honoring, complying with or otherwise
performing or consummating any contractual commitments or obligations entered into during a Suspension Period) will give
rise to a Default or Event of Default under the Indenture with respect to the notes; provided that (1) with respect to Restricted
Payments made after any such reinstatement, the amount of Restricted Payments made will be calculated as though the covenant
described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension
Period (accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be made
as Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of “––Limitation on Restricted Payments”) and (2) all Indebtedness Incurred,
or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during the Suspension Period will be classified to have been Incurred or issued


-----

pursuant to clause (c) of the second paragraph of “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified
_Stock and Preferred Stock.”_

In addition, for purposes of the covenant described under “—Transactions with Affiliates,” all agreements and arrangements
entered into by the Issuer and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries with an Affiliate of the Issuer during the Suspension Period
prior to such Reversion Date will be deemed to have been entered into on or prior to the Issue Date, and for purposes of the
covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries,” all contracts entered into
during the Suspension Period prior to such Reversion Date that contain any of the restrictions contemplated by such covenant
will be deemed to have been existing on the Issue Date.

The Issuer shall provide an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee indicating the occurrence of any Covenant Suspension Event or
Reversion Date. The Trustee will have no obligation to (i) independently determine or verify if such events have occurred,
(ii) make any determination regarding the impact of actions taken during the Suspension Period on the Issuer’s and its
Subsidiaries’ future compliance with their covenants or (iii) notify the holders of any Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion
Date.

**_Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock._**

The Indenture will provide that:

(1) the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness) or issue any shares of Disqualified Stock; and

(2) the Issuer will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any shares of Preferred Stock,

_provided, however, that the Issuer and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired_
Indebtedness) or issue shares of Disqualified Stock and any of the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries may issue shares of Preferred
Stock (any such Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock Incurred or issued pursuant to this proviso, the “Ratio
**Debt”), in each case if either (x) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the most**
recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on
which such additional Indebtedness is Incurred or such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is issued would have been at least
2.00 to 1.00 or (y) the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the most recently ended
four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such
additional Indebtedness is Incurred or such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is issued would have been no greater than
6.25 to 1.00, in each case, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom),

test set forth in the first paragraph of this covenant for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for
which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional
Indebtedness is Incurred (with any Indebtedness Incurred under subclauses (i) or (ii) hereof on the date of
determination of the applicable ratio not being included in the calculation of such ratio under this subclause
(iii) on such date (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, excluded from any such calculation made on any such
subsequent date));

of a member of the Group and/or under or pursuant to any residual liability with respect to such declaration arising under
Article 2:404 (2) of the Dutch Civil Code or, in each case, its equivalent in any other jurisdiction.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt or is entitled to
be Incurred as Ratio Debt, the Issuer shall, in its sole discretion, at the time of Incurrence, divide and/or classify, or at any later
time re-divide and/or reclassify, such item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) in
any manner that complies with this covenant. With respect to clauses (d), (k), (r)(ii), (s)(i) and (x) of the second paragraph of
this covenant, if at any time the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary would be entitled to have Incurred any then outstanding item
of Indebtedness as Ratio Debt, such item of Indebtedness shall be automatically reclassified into an item of Indebtedness
Incurred as Ratio Debt. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement outstanding on the
Completion Date shall be deemed to have been Incurred pursuant to clause (a)(i) of the second paragraph of this covenant, and
the Issuer shall not be permitted to reclassify all or any portion of such Indebtedness. The Issuer will also be entitled to divide
an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types permitted in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant without
giving pro forma effect to the Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) Incurred on the date
of determination pursuant to the second paragraph of this covenant (except to the extent Incurred in reliance of the Consolidated
Total Debt Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Debt Ratio or the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio pursuant to the terms of
such other clause) when calculating the amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof)
that may be Incurred on such date pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a Debt Facility,
reborrowings of amounts previously repaid, shall, at the option of the Issuer, only be deemed for purposes of this covenant to
have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent reborrowing thereof.
Accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original issue discount or deferred financing costs, the
payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, the payment of dividends on Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock in the form of additional shares of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of the same class, the accretion of
liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange
rate of currencies will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for purposes
of this covenant. For the avoidance of doubt, the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness shall be counted
only once and guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit relating to, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in
the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included in the determination of such amount of
Indebtedness; provided that the Incurrence of the Indebtedness represented by such guarantee or letter of credit, as the case
may be, was in compliance with this covenant.

For purposes of determining compliance with any Euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro
equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than Euros shall be calculated based on the
relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed
or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower Euro equivalent), in the case of revolving credit debt; provided that if such
Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than Euros, and such refinancing
would cause the applicable Euro- denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate
in effect on the date of such refinancing, such Euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long
as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the outstanding, in the case of term debt, or if greater,
committed principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded, with respect to any outstanding
Indebtedness, solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness
Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, will be
calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which the respective Indebtedness is denominated
that is in effect on the date of the refinancing.

**_Financial Calculations. When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture, in each case in_**
connection with any acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture, investment, Irrevocable Repayment or similar transaction
where there is a time difference between commitment and closing or Incurrence (including in respect of Incurrence of
Indebtedness, Liens, Restricted Payments and Permitted Investments), the date of determination of such basket or ratio and of
any Default or Event of Default shall, at the option of the Issuer, be the date the definitive agreements for such acquisition,
disposition, merger, joint venture, investment, Irrevocable Repayment or similar transaction are entered into and such baskets
or ratios shall be calculated on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture,
investment, Irrevocable Repayment or similar transaction and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith


-----

(including any Incurrence of Indebtedness (and the use of proceeds thereof) and Liens) as if they occurred at the beginning of
the applicable reference period for purposes of determining the ability to consummate any such transaction (and not for
purposes of any subsequent availability of any basket or ratio), and, for the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets or
ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in EBITDA of the Issuer or
the target company) subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction,
such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of
determining whether the transaction is permitted hereunder and (y) such baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time of
consummation of such transaction or related transactions; provided, further, that if the Issuer elects to have such determinations
occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement, any such transactions (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness (and
the use of proceeds thereof) and Liens) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreements are entered and
outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the Indenture after the date of such agreement and
before the consummation of such transaction.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction
herein, the euro equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a non-euro currency shall be calculated based on
the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such non-euro transaction is made. No Default or breach under the
Indenture shall arise merely as a result of any subsequent change in currency exchange rates.

In respect of any four full fiscal quarter period, exchange rates used in relation to an item of Consolidated Total Indebtedness
may be, at the election of Issuer, (i) the weighted average exchange rates for that period, (ii) the exchange rate used in the
relevant financial statements as of the last day of such period, (iii) the exchange rate as in effect on the date that Indebtedness
was incurred or (iv) the exchange rate on the Issue Date; provided that, where applicable and at the election of the Issuer, any
amount of Indebtedness will be stated so as to take into account the hedging effect of any currency hedging entered into in
respect of or by reference to that Indebtedness.

Any basket, test or permission where an element is set by reference to a percentage of EBITDA shall be tested by reference to
the applicable level of EBITDA for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are
available immediately preceding the date of calculation. If any Lien, Indebtedness, Asset Sale, Investment, Restricted Payment
or other transaction, action, judgment or amount (any of the foregoing in concurrent transactions, a single transaction or a series
of related transactions) is incurred, issued, taken or consummated in reliance on categories of baskets measured by reference
to a percentage of EBITDA, and any Lien, Indebtedness, Asset Sale, Investment, Restricted Payment or other transaction,
action, judgment or amount (including in connection with refinancing thereof) would subsequently exceed the applicable
percentage of EBITDA if calculated based on the EBITDA on a later date (including the date of any refinancing or reclassification), such percentage of EBITDA will not be deemed to be exceeded (so long as, in the case of refinancing any
Indebtedness (and any related Lien), the principal amount or the liquidation preference of such newly incurred or issued
Indebtedness does not exceed the maximum principal amount or amount of Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of the
Indebtedness, being refinanced, extended, replaced, refunded, renewed or defeased).

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments. The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted_**
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on account of the Issuer’s or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests (in each case, solely to a holder of Equity Interests in such Person’s capacity
as a holder of such Equity Interests), including any payment made in connection with any merger or

succeeding paragraph), is less than the sum of, without duplication,

(1) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Issuer for the period (taken as one accounting period)

contemplation of, or in connection with, an event that would otherwise constitute a Change of Control, (2) the purpose of the

applied, the Net Cash Proceeds, or fair market value of property or assets or of marketable securities, from such sale of
Equity Interests or Subordinated Shareholder Debt or such contribution will be excluded from clause (c) of the preceding
paragraph); (b) if immediately prior to the retirement of Retired Capital Stock, the declaration and payment of dividends
thereon was permitted under clause (6) of this paragraph, the declaration and payment of dividends on the Refunding

thereof.

The Issuer will not permit any Unrestricted Subsidiary to become a Restricted Subsidiary except pursuant to the definition of
“Unrestricted Subsidiary.” For purposes of designating any Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, all outstanding
Investments by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid prior to the time of designation) in the
Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments or Permitted Investments in an amount determined as set
forth in the last sentence of the definition of “Investments.” Such designation will only be permitted if a Restricted Payment or
Permitted Investment in such amount would be permitted at such time and if such Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of
an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

For purposes of the covenant described above, if any Investment or Restricted Payment would be permitted pursuant to one or
more provisions described above and/or one or more of the exceptions contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments,”
the Issuer may divide and classify such Investment or Restricted Payment in any manner that complies with this covenant and
may later divide and reclassify any such Investment or Restricted Payment so long as the Investment or Restricted Payment (as
so divided and/or reclassified) would be permitted to be made in reliance on the applicable exception as of the date of such
reclassification. In the event that a Restricted Payment (or any portion thereof) or Permitted Investment (or any portion thereof)
is divided, classified or reclassified under clause (22) above or clause (31) of the definition of “Permitted Investments” (such
clauses, the “Incurrence Clauses”), the determination of the amount of such Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment that
may be made pursuant to the Incurrence Clauses shall be made without giving pro forma effect to any substantially concurrent
Incurrence of Indebtedness to finance any other Restricted Payment (or any portion thereof) or Permitted Investment (or any
portion thereof) divided, classified or reclassified under any of the above clauses or the definitions thereof other than an
Incurrence Clause.

**_Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries. The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will_**
not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is not a Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause to become
effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a
Guarantor to:

(a) (i) pay dividends or make any other distributions to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (1) on its Capital Stock
or (2) with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits; or (ii) pay any Indebtedness owed
to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

provide all or any portion of the funds or credit support utilized to consummate such acquisition other than in
connection with the Incurrence of Indebtedness of the type contemplated by clause (d) of the second paragraph of the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitations on Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
_Preferred Stock”), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any_

that impose restrictions of the type described in clause (c) above on the property subject to such lease, license, contract
or agreement;

(11) any encumbrances or restrictions contained in any Permitted Securitization Document with respect to any Special
Purpose Securitization Subsidiary;

(12) other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of (a) the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that
is a Guarantor or (b) any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that is not a Guarantor, in each case that is Incurred
subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and
_Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock;” provided that, in the case of clause (b), either (i) such encumbrances_
and restrictions contained in any agreement or instrument will not materially adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make
anticipated principal or interest payment on the notes (as determined by the Issuer in good faith), (ii) such encumbrances
and restrictions are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, than those contained in the Transaction Documents
or the Indenture (with respect to other indentures) or the Credit Agreement outstanding on the Issue Date (with respect
to other credit agreements) or (iii) such encumbrances and restrictions apply only during the continuance of a default in
respect of a payment or financial maintenance covenant relating to such Indebtedness;

(13) any Restricted Investment not prohibited by the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” and
any Permitted Investment;


-----

(14) arising or agreed to in the ordinary course of business, not relating to any Indebtedness, and that do not, individually or
in the aggregate, detract from the value of property or assets of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary thereof in any
manner material to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary thereof;

(15) existing under, by reason of or with respect to Refinancing Indebtedness; provided that the encumbrances and restrictions
contained in the agreements governing that Refinancing Indebtedness are not materially more restrictive, taken as a
whole, than those contained in the agreements governing the Indebtedness being refinanced;

(16) restrictions or conditions contained in any trading, netting, operating, construction, service, supply, purchase, sale or
other agreement to which the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a party entered into in the ordinary course of
business; provided that such agreement prohibits the encumbrance of solely the property or assets of the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary that are the subject of such agreement, the payment rights arising thereunder or the proceeds thereof
and does not extend to any other asset or property of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary or the assets or property of
any other Restricted Subsidiary;

(17) in the case of clause (c) of the first paragraph of this covenant, any encumbrance or restriction that restricts in a customary
manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract,
or the assignment or transfer of any such lease, license (including without limitations, licenses of intellectual property)
or other contracts; and

(18) any encumbrances or restrictions of the type referred to in clauses (a), (b) and (c) above imposed or effected by any
amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of
the contracts, instruments or obligations referred to in clauses (1) through (17) above or any new arrangements on
substantially similar terms; provided that such amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases,
supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings or new arrangements are, in the good faith judgment of the Issuer,
not materially more restrictive as a whole with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those
contained in the dividend or other payment restrictions prior to such amendment, modification, restatement, renewal,
increase, supplement, refunding, replacement or refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant (i) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or
liquidating distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock shall not be deemed a
restriction on the ability to make distributions on Capital Stock and (ii) the subordination of loans or advances made to the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be
deemed a restriction on the ability to make loans or advances.

**_Asset Sales. The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, cause_**
or make an Asset Sale, unless:

(1) the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, receives consideration at the time of such Asset Sale
at least equal to the Fair Market Value (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) of the Equity Interests issued or assets
sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration for such Asset Sale, together with all
other Asset Sales since the Issue Date (on a cumulative basis), received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as
the case may be, is in the form of Cash Equivalents; provided that the amount of:

(a) any liabilities (as shown on the Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent balance sheet or in the notes
thereto or, if Incurred, increased or decreased subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities that
would have been reflected in the Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s balance sheet or in the notes thereto if
such Incurrence, increase or decrease had taken place on the date of such balance sheet, as reasonably determined
in good faith by the Issuer) of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than liabilities that are by their terms
subordinated to the notes) that are assumed by the transferee (or a third party on behalf of the transferee) of any
such assets or Equity Interests or that are otherwise cancelled or terminated in connection with the transaction with
such transferee;

(b) any notes or other obligations or other securities or assets received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from
such transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within
180 days of the receipt thereof (to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received);

(c) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in such Asset
Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration
received pursuant to this clause (c) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (x) €67.5 million
and (y) 25% of EBITDA of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the most recently ended four full fiscal


-----

quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date of calculation, at the
time of the receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration (with the Fair Market Value of each item of
Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent
changes in value);

(d) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such
Asset Sale, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any guarantee of
such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Sale; and

(e) consideration consisting of Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness that is by its terms subordinated to the notes) of
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary received from Persons who are not the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary,

shall each be deemed to be Cash Equivalents for the purposes of this provision.

Within 18 months after the Issuer’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s receipt of the Net Cash Proceeds of any Asset Sale, the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary may apply an amount equal to the Net Cash Proceeds from such Asset Sale, at its option:

(1) to repay Secured Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor or Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary (and, if the Indebtedness repaid is revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments
with respect thereto), other than Subordinated Indebtedness or Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or another Restricted
Subsidiary;

(2) to repay Pari Passu Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor (and, if the Indebtedness repaid is revolving credit
Indebtedness to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto), provided that if the Issuer or any Guarantor
shall so reduce such Indebtedness, the Issuer or such Guarantor will equally and ratably reduce Obligations under the
notes (A) through open-market purchases (provided that such purchases are at or above 100% of the principal amount
thereof), (B) by redeeming notes if the notes are then redeemable as provided under “—Optional Redemption” or (C) by
making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all holders to purchase at
a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any;

(3) to make an investment in any one or more businesses (provided that if such investment is in the form of the acquisition
of Capital Stock of a Person, such Person is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer), or assets, property or
capital expenditures in each case used or useful in a Similar Business or to reimburse the cost of any of the foregoing
incurred on or after the date on which the Asset Sale giving rise to such Net Cash Proceeds was contractually committed;

(4) to make an investment in any one or more businesses (provided that if such investment is in the form of the acquisition
of Capital Stock of a Person, such Person is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer), properties or assets that
replace the properties and assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale or to reimburse the cost of any of the foregoing
incurred on or after the date on which the Asset Sale giving rise to such Net Cash Proceeds was contractually committed;

(5) to repay Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or any Indebtedness that is secured by Liens on
assets which do not constitute Collateral (and, if the Indebtedness repaid is revolving credit Indebtedness, to
correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto), other than Subordinated Indebtedness or Indebtedness owed
to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary; or

(6) any combination of the foregoing,

provided that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be deemed to have complied with the provisions described in clauses
(3) and (4) of this paragraph if and to the extent that, within 18 months after the Asset Sale that generated the Net Cash Proceeds,
the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary has entered into and not abandoned or rejected a binding agreement to acquire
the assets or Capital Stock of a Similar Business, make an investment or make a capital expenditure in compliance with the
provision described in clauses (3) and (4) of this paragraph (an “Acceptable Agreement”) with the good faith expectation that
such acquisition, purchase or capital expenditure will be completed within six months after the end of such 18-month period;
provided, further, that if any Acceptable Agreement is later cancelled or terminated for any reason after the end of such 18month period and before an amount equal to such Net Cash Proceeds is applied, then such unapplied amount shall constitute
Excess Proceeds (as defined below).

Pending the final application of any amount, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary may temporarily reduce Indebtedness
under a revolving credit facility, if any, or otherwise use such amount in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. Any
amount equal to the Net Cash Proceeds from any Asset Sale that is not applied as provided and within the time period set forth
in the two preceding paragraphs (it being understood that any portion of such Net Cash Proceeds used to make an offer to
purchase notes, as described in clause (2) above, shall be deemed to have been invested whether or not such offer is accepted)
will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds.”


-----

When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of (x) €55.0 million and (y) 20% of EBITDA of the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are
available immediately preceding the date of calculation (the “Excess Proceeds Threshold”), the Issuer shall make an offer to
all holders of notes, and, at the option of the Issuer, to the holders of any Pari Passu Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor
(an “Asset Sale Offer”) to purchase the maximum principal amount of notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness that may be
purchased out of the Applicable Percentage of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the
principal amount thereof (or, in the event such Pari Passu Indebtedness was issued with significant original issue discount,
100% of the accreted value thereof), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any (or, in respect of such Pari Passu Indebtedness,
such lesser price, if any, as may be offered to the holders of such other Pari Passu Indebtedness), to, but excluding, the date
fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or agreements governing such
Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and, in the case of the notes, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to the Applicable Percentage
of Excess Proceeds within ten (10) Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceeds the Excess Proceeds Threshold
by mailing or electronically sending or otherwise providing in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. The Issuer may, at its option,
satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to an amount equal to or less than the amount of any Net Cash Proceeds from an
Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer prior to the expiration of the relevant 18 months (or such longer period as provided
above) or with respect to Excess Proceeds below the Excess Proceeds Threshold. To the extent that the aggregate amount of
notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the
amount of Excess Proceeds with respect to which an Asset Sale Offer has been made, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries
may use such remaining Excess Proceeds (the “Declined Excess Proceeds”) for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the
Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of notes or the Pari Passu Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor surrendered
by holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds subject to the Asset Sale Offer, the Issuer shall select or cause to be
selected the notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis based on the accreted value or principal
amount of the notes or such Indebtedness tendered. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess
Proceeds shall be reset to zero.

The procedures for an Asset Sale Offer will be substantially the same as for a Change of Control Offer. The Issuer will comply
with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations to the extent such
laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent
that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply
with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the
Indenture by virtue thereof.

Future credit agreements to which the Company becomes a party may limit or prohibit the Company from purchasing any notes
as a result of an Asset Sale Offer. In the event the Company is required to make an Asset Sale Offer at a time when the Company
is prohibited from purchasing the notes, the Company could seek the consent of its lenders to permit the purchase of the notes
or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Company does not obtain such consent or
repay such borrowings, the Company will remain prohibited from purchasing the notes. In such case, the Company’s failure to
purchase tendered notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.

The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an Asset Sale Offer may be waived or modified
with the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes.

**_Transactions with Affiliates. The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted_**
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties
or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction or series of transactions,
contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Issuer (each of
the foregoing, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate consideration in excess of the greater of (x) €27.0 million and
(y) 10% of EBITDA of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which
internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date of calculation, unless:

(a) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are not materially less favorable, when taken as a whole, to the Issuer or the
relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that could have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person; and

(b) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in
excess of the greater of (x) €55.0 million and (y) 20% of EBITDA of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the
most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding
the date of calculation, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee a resolution adopted in good faith by the majority of the Board


-----

agreement as in effect on the Completion Date as determined by the Issuer in good faith);

(8) the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of its obligations under the terms
of any stockholders or similar agreement (including any registration rights agreement or purchase agreement related
thereto) to which it (or any Parent) is a party as of the Completion Date, and any transaction, agreement or arrangement
described in this offering memorandum and, in each case, any amendment thereto or similar transactions, agreements or
arrangements which it (or any Parent) may enter into thereafter; provided, however, that the existence of, or the
performance by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of its obligations under, any future amendment to any
such existing transaction, agreement or arrangement or under any similar transaction, agreement or arrangement entered
into after the Completion Date shall only be permitted by this clause (8) to the extent that the terms of any such existing
transaction, agreement or arrangement together with all amendments thereto, taken as a whole, or new transaction,

compared to the original transaction, agreement or arrangement as in effect on the Issue Date or described in this offering

**_Liens. The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of the Guarantors to, directly or indirectly,_**
create or Incur any Lien that secures obligations under any Indebtedness on any asset or property of the Issuer or any Guarantors,
except: (x) in the case of any asset or property that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens and (y) in the case of any
asset or property that does not constitute Collateral, (i) Permitted Liens or (ii) Liens other than Permitted Liens; provided that
with respect to clause (y)(ii) that (1) in the case of Liens securing Subordinated Indebtedness, the notes or the applicable
Guarantee of a Guarantor, as the case may be, are secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, by a Lien on such property
or assets that is senior in priority to such Liens; (2) in the case of Liens securing Senior Indebtedness, the notes or the applicable
Guarantee of a Guarantor, as the case may be, are secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, by a Lien on such property
or assets that is junior in priority to such Liens, and (3) in all other cases, the notes or the applicable Guarantee of a Guarantor,
as the case may be, are equally and ratably secured.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Lien securing the notes granted pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be automatically
and unconditionally released and discharged upon (a) the release by the holders of the Indebtedness described above of their
Lien on the property or assets of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (including any deemed release upon payment in full
of all obligations under such Indebtedness (except upon foreclosure or default of such Indebtedness)), (b) any sale, exchange
or transfer to any Person other than the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the property or assets secured by such Lien, or
of all of the Capital Stock held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in, or all or substantially all the assets of, any
Restricted Subsidiary creating such Lien in each case in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, (c) payment in full of the
principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the notes, (d) a defeasance or discharge of the notes in accordance with
the procedures described below under “—Defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge” or (e) in connection with an IPO
Pushdown as specified in the Indenture.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (A) a Lien (or any portion thereof) need not be permitted solely
by reference to one category of permitted Liens (or any portion thereof) described in the definition of “Permitted Liens” or
“Permitted Collateral Liens” or pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant but may be permitted in part under any
combination thereof and (B) in the event that a Lien (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of one or more of the categories
of permitted Liens (or any portion thereof) described in the definition of “Permitted Liens” or “Permitted Collateral Liens” or
pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer may, in its sole discretion, divide, classify or reclassify, or later
divide, classify or reclassify (as if Incurred at such later time), such Lien securing such item of Indebtedness (or any portion
thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant, and at the time of Incurrence, division, classification or reclassification
will be entitled to only include the amount and type of such Lien or such item of Indebtedness secured by such Lien (or any
portion thereof) in one of the categories of permitted Liens (or any portion thereof) described in the definition of “Permitted
Liens” or “Permitted Collateral Liens” or pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and, in such event, such Lien securing
such item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) will be treated as being Incurred or existing pursuant to only such clause or
clauses (or any portion thereof) or pursuant to the first paragraph hereof without giving pro forma effect to such item (or any
portion thereof) when calculating the amount of Liens or Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) that may be Incurred pursuant
to any other clause or paragraph (or any portion thereof) at such time.


-----

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the Incurrence of
such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such Indebtedness. The “Increased
**Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of**
interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of
additional Indebtedness with the same terms or in the form of common stock, the payment of dividends on Preferred Stock in
the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock of the same class, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference,
any fees, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, premiums and other costs and expenses incurred in connection
therewith and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of
currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Layering. The Issuer will not permit any Guarantor to, and no Guarantor shall, Incur any Indebtedness that is or_**
purports to be by its terms (or by the terms of any agreement governing such Indebtedness) subordinated in right of payment
to any Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is pari passu with the Guarantee of such Guarantor or
is also by its terms (or by the terms of any agreement governing such Indebtedness, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) made subordinated in right of payment to the Guarantee of such Guarantor; provided that
the foregoing limitation shall not apply to distinctions between categories of Senior Indebtedness that exist by reason of (x) any
Liens or guarantees arising or created in respect of some but not all such Senior Indebtedness or (y) being secured on a junior
priority basis; provided, further, that Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement or a Debt Facility that is Senior Indebtedness
of a Guarantor may provide for an ordering of payments among the tranches of such Credit Agreement or Debt Facility.

**_Limitation on Issuer Activities. The Issuer shall not trade, carry on any business, own any assets or incur any liabilities or grant_**
any Lien except for a Permitted Holding Company Activity.

**_Maintenance of Listing. The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain on or prior to the first interest payment_**
date a listing of the notes on the Exchange or another recognized stock exchange, and use its commercially reasonable efforts
to maintain such listing for so long as such notes are outstanding; provided that if the Issuer is unable to obtain admissions to
such listing or if at any time the Issuer determines that it will not maintain such listing, it will use commercially reasonable
efforts to (when the notes are initially so listed, prior to the delisting of the notes from the Exchange or other recognized stock
exchange), obtain a listing of such notes on another recognized stock exchange for high yield issuers (which may be another
stock exchange that is not regulated by the European Union), and thereafter use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain
such listing.

**_Reports and Other Information._**

For so long as any notes are outstanding, the Issuer will provide to the Trustee the following reports:

(1) within 120 days, or, in the case of the first such report, 150 days after the end of the Reporting Entity’s fiscal year
beginning with the first fiscal year ending after the Issue Date, annual reports containing, to the extent applicable, the
following information: (a) audited consolidated balance sheets of the Reporting Entity as of the end of the two most
recent fiscal years and audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Reporting Entity for
the two most recent fiscal years, including complete footnotes to such financial statements and the report of the
independent auditors on the financial statements; (b) unaudited pro forma income statement information and balance
sheet information of the Reporting Entity (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the provision of a full
income statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available), together with explanatory footnotes, for any
material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the fiscal year to which
such annual report relates, unless such pro forma information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clauses
(2) or (3) below (provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available without
unreasonable expense, and, in the case of a material acquisition, the Reporting Entity may instead provide acquired
company financials to the extent available without unreasonable expense); (c) an operating and financial review of the
audited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and
capital resources of the Reporting Entity, and a discussion of material commitments and contingencies, capital
expenditures and critical accounting policies; (d) a description of the business, management and shareholders of the
Reporting Entity, material affiliate transactions and material debt instruments (unless such contractual arrangements were
described in a previous annual or quarterly report, in which case the Reporting Entity need describe only any material
changes); and (e) a description of material risk factors and material recent developments;

(2) [reserved];

(3) within 60 days, or, in the case of the first three such reports, 90 days following the end of the first three fiscal quarters in
each fiscal year of the Reporting Entity beginning with the quarter ending after the Completion Date, all quarterly reports


-----

of the Reporting Entity containing the following information: (a) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as
of the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the quarterly and year-todate period ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and the comparable prior year period, together with
condensed footnote disclosure; (b) unaudited pro forma income statement information and balance sheet information of
the Reporting Entity (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the provision of a full income statement or
balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available), together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions,
dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the fiscal quarter as to which such quarterly
report relates (provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available without
unreasonable expense, and in the case of a material acquisition, the Reporting Entity may instead provide acquired
company financials to the extent available without unreasonable expense); (c) an operating and financial review of the
financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital
resources of the Reporting Entity, and a discussion of material changes not in the ordinary course of business in
commitments and contingencies since the most recent report; and (d) material recent developments; and

(4) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring or any senior executive officer
changes at the Reporting Entity or change in auditors of the Reporting Entity or any other material event that the Issuer
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries announces publicly, a report containing a description of such event;

provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above will not be required to (i) contain any reconciliation
to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or (ii) include separate financial statements for Guarantors or non-Guarantor
Subsidiaries of the Reporting Entity.

All financial statements and pro forma financial information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date
of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the
periods presented; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1) and (3) above may, (x) in the event of a change
in applicable IFRS, present earlier periods (including any periods prior to the Completion Date) on a basis that applied to such
periods and (y) to the extent comparable prior period financial information of the Reporting Entity does not exist, the
comparable prior period financial information of the Target Business may be provided in lieu thereof. Following an Initial
Public Offering of the Capital Stock of the Issuer or any Parent or IPO Entity, the requirements of clauses (1) and (3) above
shall be considered to have been fulfilled if the Issuer or the IPO Entity complies with the reporting requirements of such stock
exchange.

Except as provided for herein, no report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted Subsidiary or group
of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the
annual and quarterly financial information required by clauses (1) and (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant shall include
a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial
condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results
of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

Substantially concurrently with the issuance to the Trustee of the reports specified in clauses (1) and (3) of the first paragraph
of this covenant, the Issuer shall also (a) use its commercially reasonable efforts (i) to post copies of such reports on such
website as may be then maintained by the Issuer or the Reporting Entity or (ii) otherwise to provide substantially comparable
availability of such reports (as determined by the Issuer in good faith) or (b) to the extent the Issuer determines in good faith
that it cannot make such reports available in the manner described in the preceding clause (a) owing to applicable law or after
the use of its commercially reasonable efforts, furnish such reports to the holders and, upon request, prospective purchasers of
the notes.

The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee no later than the date on which the Issuer is required to deliver annual reports pursuant to
the covenant described above, an Officer’s Certificate stating that in the course of the performance by the relevant officers of
their respective duties as an officer of the Issuer they would normally have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default and
whether or not such officers know of any Default that occurred during such period and, if any, specifying such Default or Event
of Default, its status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.

In addition, so long as the notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the Reporting Entity is not subject to
Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b), the Issuer shall furnish to the
holders and, upon their request, prospective purchasers of the notes, the information required to be delivered pursuant to
Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.


-----

The Issuer may satisfy its obligations and the requirements of this covenant with respect to financial information relating to the
Issuer by furnishing financial information relating to the Issuer or to any Parent (any such entity that provides such financial
statements, information or other documents, the “Reporting Entity”) consolidating reporting at its level in a manner consistent
with that described in this covenant; provided that such financial information is accompanied by consolidating information
that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to such Reporting Entity and its Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and the information relating to the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand.

**_Future Guarantors. The Indenture will provide that, to the extent legally possible and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement_**
and to the Agreed Security Principles, the Issuer will cause each Restricted Subsidiary (other than any Excluded Subsidiary)
that is a Borrower or a Guarantor (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in respect of any Indebtedness Incurred under any Credit
Agreement, to execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture pursuant to which such Subsidiary will become a
Guarantor under the Indenture within 20 Business Days of the date that such guarantee has been granted pursuant to any Credit
Agreement.

Each Guarantee will be subordinated and contractually limited as it relates to such Guarantor, to reflect limitations under the
Agreed Security Principles and applicable law with respect to, among other things, thin capitalization, maintenance of share
capital, legal or corporate benefit, tax restrictions, fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance and other legal restrictions
applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors and general partners. See “Guarantees” and “Security;
_the Collateral.” By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than_
amounts payable with respect to the notes or could even be reduced to zero. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes”
and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations.”_

Each Guarantee shall be released in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture described under “—Guarantees.”

For the avoidance of doubt, this covenant shall only be applicable following the Completion Date.

**_IPO Pushdown_**

(a) At the option of the Issuer, on, in contemplation of, or following an IPO Event, the Issuer shall be entitled to require (by
written notice to the Trustee (a “Pushdown Notice”)) that the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement
shall operate (with effect from the date specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice (the “Pushdown Date”)) on the basis
that (unless otherwise set out in the Pushdown Notice):

(i) references to the Issuer and Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) shall apply only to the IPO Entity and
its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time;

(ii) all financial ratio calculations, basket calculations, and financial definitions shall exclude any holding company of
the IPO Entity and all reporting obligations shall be assumed at the level of the IPO Entity (or as otherwise permitted by
the Indenture);

(iii) each reference in the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) to a
holding company of the Issuer or a holding company of the IPO Entity performing a particular role or acting in a particular
capacity shall (unless specified otherwise in the Pushdown Notice) be deemed to be a reference to the IPO Entity (to the
extent applicable and unless the context requires otherwise, and provided that nothing in this paragraph (a), including the
deeming construct contemplated by this sub-paragraph (iii) and any action taken by the IPO Entity prior to such
designation, shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any covenant or other
term in the Indenture or a Default or an Event of Default);

(iv) none of the representations, warranties, undertakings, covenants, Defaults or Events of Default in the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or the Security Documents or otherwise shall apply
to any Person of which the IPO Entity is Subsidiary (whether in its capacity as a Guarantor or otherwise);

(v) no event, matter or circumstance relating to any holding company of the IPO Entity (whether in its capacity as a
Guarantor or otherwise) shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any covenant
or other term in the Indenture or a Default or an Event of Default;

(vi) the obligations of the Issuer under the notes will be (and will be deemed to have been) novated or otherwise
transferred to the IPO Entity (or, subject to paragraph (c) below, to a Restricted Subsidiary of the IPO Entity); provided
that such entity is incorporated in the same jurisdiction as the Issuer or another Permitted Jurisdiction;


-----

(vii) each holding company of the IPO Entity shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from all obligations under
and in connection with the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and any
security granted by it or any holding company of it;

(viii) each holding company of the IPO Entity that has been party to the Notes Documents, and each Subsidiary of such
holding company that is not the IPO Entity or a Subsidiary thereof, will not, on the Pushdown Date after giving pro forma
effect thereto, have any assets (other than shares in its subsidiaries and intercompany receivables) that are material to, or
reasonably necessary for the operations of, the business of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries; and

(vii) unless otherwise notified by the Issuer: (A) each Person which is party to the Intercreditor Agreement and which is
a holding company of the IPO Entity shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from the Intercreditor Agreement
and all obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement (and from the date specified by the Issuer that
person shall cease to be party to the Intercreditor Agreement and shall have no further rights or obligations under the
Intercreditor Agreement); and (B) there shall be no obligation or requirement for any such holding company to become
party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement); and (C) any term of the Indenture
and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and/or any other agreement which
requires or assumes that such holding company be a party to the Intercreditor Agreement or that any liabilities or
obligations be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or otherwise
subordinated shall cease to apply.

A Pushdown Notice may not be delivered if a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (disregarding
any Default or Event of Default that could be deemed to arise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
provision).

(b) The Trustee and the Security Agent shall be required to enter into any amendment to the Indenture or amendment to or
replacement of the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or the Security Documents or
any other agreement or instrument required by the Issuer and/or take such other action as is required by the Issuer in
order to facilitate or reflect any of the matters contemplated by paragraph (a) above, provided that, in the opinion of the
Trustee and/or the Security Agent, such amendment, replacement or other document or instrument does not impose any
personal obligations on the Trustee and/or the Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee and/or the Security Agent,
as applicable, does not affect the rights, duties, powers, liabilities, indemnifications or immunities of the Trustee and/or
the Security Agent, as applicable, under such amendment, replacement or other document or instrument. The Trustee and
the Security Agent are each irrevocably authorized and instructed by the holders of the notes (without any consent by the
holders of the notes) to execute any such amendment or replacement documents and/or take such other action on behalf
of the holders of the notes (and shall do so on the request of and at the cost of the Issuer).

(c) For the purpose of this covenant and the Indenture, the “IPO Entity” shall be the Issuer, any Parent, any Guarantor or
any Restricted Subsidiary (or any successor of any such Person) as notified to the Trustee by the Issuer in writing as the
Person to be treated as the IPO Entity in relation to the relevant IPO Event, provided that the IPO Entity shall be an entity
which will issue shares, or whose shares are to be sold, pursuant to that IPO Event (or a holding company thereof).

(d) If a Pushdown Notice is delivered to the Trustee pursuant to paragraph (a) above in relation to a contemplated IPO Event,
the person who delivered that Pushdown Notice shall be entitled to revoke that Pushdown Notice at any time prior to the
occurrence of the relevant IPO Event by written notice to the Trustee. In the event that any Pushdown Notice is revoked
in accordance with this paragraph (d): (i) the provisions of sub-paragraphs (a)(i) to (a)(vii) above shall cease to apply in
relation to that Pushdown Notice; (ii) if any security has been released pursuant to paragraph (a) above in reliance on that
Pushdown Notice, if required by the Security Agent by prior written notice to the Issuer and subject to the Agreed Security
Principles, the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary shall as soon as reasonably practicable execute a replacement
Security Document in respect of that security; and (iii) if any person party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an “Investor”, “Shareholder Creditor” or equivalent term has been released from
the Intercreditor Agreement pursuant to sub-paragraph (a)(vii) above in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, if required by
the Trustee by prior written notice to the Issuer and that Person, that Person shall as soon as reasonably practicable accede
to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor, Shareholder Creditor or
equivalent term.

For the avoidance of doubt: (A) nothing in paragraph (d) above shall prohibit or otherwise restrict the Issuer from delivering a
further Pushdown Notice in relation to any actual or contemplated IPO Event; and (B) revocation of a Pushdown Notice shall
not, and shall not be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking
or other term in the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any other document or instrument or a Default or an Event of
Default (whether by reason of any action or step taken by any person, or any matter or circumstance arising or committed,
while that Pushdown Notice was effective or otherwise).


-----

**Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer may not consolidate or merge with or into or wind up into (whether or not it is the
surviving corporation), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or
assets (determined on a consolidated basis), in one or more related transactions, to any Person unless:

(1) either (a) the Issuer is the surviving Person or (b) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger or
winding up (if other than the Issuer) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition
will have been made is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or similar entity organized or existing under
the laws of any member state of the European Union, the United Kingdom or the United States of America, any State of
the United States or the District of Columbia or Switzerland (each a “Permitted Jurisdiction”) (the Issuer or such Person,
as the case may be, being herein called the “Successor Company” for the purposes of this paragraph);

(2) the Successor Company (if other than the Issuer) expressly assumes all the obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture
and the notes, pursuant to supplemental indentures or other documents or instruments;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the
Successor Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the
Successor Company or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction) no Default or Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing;

(4) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction, as if such transaction had occurred at the beginning of the
applicable four-quarter period, either

(a) the Successor Company would be permitted to Incur at least €1.00 of additional Indebtedness as Ratio Debt; or

(b) either (I) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Successor Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries would not
be less than such ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction or (II)
the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio for the Successor Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries would not be greater
than such ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction; and

(5) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which may be subject
to customary assumptions and exclusions) stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental
indentures (if any) comply with the Indenture.

The Successor Company (if other than the Issuer) will succeed to, and be substituted for, the Issuer under the Indenture and the
notes and in such event the Issuer will automatically be released and discharged from its obligations under the Indenture and
the notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (3) and (4) above, (a) the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate with,
merge into or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary or IPO Entity, (b) the Issuer may merge or consolidate with an Affiliate incorporated or organized
solely for the purpose of reincorporating or reorganizing the Issuer in another jurisdiction that is a Permitted Jurisdiction, so
long as the amount of Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries is not increased thereby, (c) the Issuer may
convert into a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company or trust organized or existing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of organization of the Issuer or any Permitted Jurisdiction, and (d) the Transactions may occur (any
transaction described in this sentence, a “Specified Merger/Transfer Transaction”).

The Indenture will further provide that subject to certain limitations in the Indenture governing release of a Guarantee upon the
sale or disposition of a Subsidiary Guarantor, each Subsidiary Guarantor will not, and the Issuer will not permit any Subsidiary
Guarantor to, consolidate or merge with or into or wind up into (whether or not such Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving
corporation), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets in
one or more related transactions to, any Person (herein called the “Successor Guarantor”) (other than the Transactions) unless:

(i) the surviving company (or company to which assets are transferred) in such liquidation, merger, sale, transfer or other
disposition is the Issuer or a Guarantor; or

(ii) such sale or disposition or consolidation or merger is not in violation of the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Asset Sales;” or_

(iii)

(1) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation
of the Successor Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred


-----

by the Successor Guarantor or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction) no Default or Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing;

(2) the Successor Guarantor (if other than such Guarantor) shall have delivered or caused to be delivered to the
Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which may be subject to customary assumptions
and exclusions) stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture complies
with the Indenture; and

(3) the Successor Guarantor expressly assumes all the obligations of such Guarantor under the Indenture and the
notes, pursuant to a supplemental indenture.

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture, the Successor Guarantor will succeed to, and be substituted for, such
Guarantor under the Indenture and such Guarantor’s Guarantee, as applicable, and such Guarantor will automatically be
released and discharged from its obligations under the Indenture and such Guarantor’s Guarantee.

Notwithstanding the requirements set forth in the proceeding paragraphs of this covenant, (1) a Guarantor may merge or
consolidate with an Affiliate (including any IPO Entity) incorporated or organized solely for the purpose of reincorporating or
reorganizing such Guarantor in another jurisdiction that is a Permitted Jurisdiction, so long as the amount of Indebtedness of
the Guarantor is not increased thereby, (2) a Subsidiary Guarantor may amalgamate, merge or consolidate with or into, or wind
up into, liquidate, dissolve, or sell, assign, lease, convey, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or part of its properties or assets
to another Restricted Subsidiary or the Issuer, (3) a Subsidiary Guarantor may convert into a corporation, partnership, limited
partnership, limited liability company or trust organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such
Guarantor or any Permitted Jurisdiction and (4) the Italian Merger may be completed.

This “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets” covenant will not apply to (i) any transaction or
arrangement pursuant to a Specified Merger/Transfer Transaction or an IPO Pushdown, (ii) a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer
transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer in order to comply
with any law, rule, regulation or order, recommendation or direction of, or agreement with, any regulatory authority having
jurisdiction over the Issuer and/or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, (iii) a Permitted Parent Reorganization or (iv) a sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of assets between or among the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to Permitted Securitization Financings.

**Events of Default**

An Event of Default will be defined in the Indenture as:

(1) a default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any note when the same becomes due and payable
and such default continues for a period of 30 days;

(2) a default in the payment of principal or premium, if any, of any note when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional
redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer for 120 days after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or the holders of not less than 30%
in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding (with a copy to the Trustee) to comply with any of its
obligations, covenants or agreements contained in the provisions of the Indenture described in “Certain Covenants—
_Reports and Other Information”;_

(4) the failure by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after written notice given by the
Trustee or the holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding (with a copy to
the Trustee) with their obligations, covenants or agreements (other than as set forth in clause (1), (2) or (3) above)
contained in the notes or the Indenture;

(5) the failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer to pay any Indebtedness for borrowed money (other
than Indebtedness owing to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Permitted Securitization Financing which is nonrecourse to the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries) within any applicable grace period after final maturity or the
acceleration of any such Indebtedness by the holders thereof because of a default, in each case, if the total amount of
such Indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds €75.0 million or its foreign currency equivalent;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer (the “bankruptcy
**provisions”);**


-----

(7) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer to pay final and non- appealable judgments aggregating
in excess of €75.0 million or its foreign currency equivalent (net of any amounts which are covered by enforceable
insurance policies issued by solvent carriers), which judgments are not paid, discharged, waived or stayed for a period
of 60 days after the judgment becomes final and, in the event, such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement
proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed (the
“judgment default provision”);

(8) the Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer ceases to be in full force and effect in any material respect (other
than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Guarantee, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Indenture, including the
release provisions thereof) or any such Guarantor denies or disaffirms its obligations under such Indenture or any
Guarantee and such Default continues for 21 days after written notice of such Default shall have been given to the Trustee;
or

(9) failure by Topco to comply with its obligations, covenants or agreements contained in the Security Documents and any
such Default continues for 30 days after written notice of such Default shall have been given to the Trustee;

(10) any security interest under the Security Documents on any material Collateral or the Escrow Charge on the Escrow
Collateral, as applicable, shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms
of the relevant Security Documents, the Escrow Charge, the Escrow Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or the
Indenture) for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release or
amendment of any such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Escrow Charge, the Escrow
Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or such Security Document or the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert
in writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for 30 days after
written notice of such Default shall have been given to the Trustee; or

(11) failure by the Issuer to consummate a Special Mandatory Redemption on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date as
described above under “Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

The foregoing will constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether it is voluntary
or involuntary or is affected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or
regulation of any administrative or governmental body.

However, a Default under clause (3) or (4) will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the holders of at least
30% of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes notify the Issuer of the Default and the Issuer does not cure such
default within the time specified in clause (3) or (4) hereof after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of
the Issuer) is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 30% of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes by
written notice to the Issuer may declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued but unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, on the notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy,
insolvency or reorganization of the Issuer occurs, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the notes will become
immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holders. Under certain
circumstances, the holders of a majority in principal amount of outstanding notes may rescind any such acceleration with
respect to the notes and its consequences.

In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (5) of the first paragraph above, such Event of Default and all
consequences thereof (including, without limitation, the declaration of acceleration of the notes) will be annulled, waived and
rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the holders of the notes, if within 30 days after such Event
of Default arose the Issuer delivers an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that (x) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is
the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged or (y) the holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration,
default, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default or (z) the default or acceleration that is the
basis for such Event of Default has been cured or waived.

The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or Event of Default unless a written notice of any event which
is in fact such a default is received by a responsible officer of the Trustee at the corporate trust office of the Trustee, and such
notice references the Notes and the Indenture.


-----

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an Event of Default occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or
direction of any of the holders of the notes unless such holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and security (which may
include pre-funding) satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of
principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the notes
unless:

(1) such holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing,

(2) holders of at least 30% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes have requested in writing that the
Trustee pursue the remedy,

(3) such holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity (which may include pre-funding) satisfactory to it against
any loss, liability or expense,

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or
indemnity, and

(5) the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent
with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the holders of a majority in principal amount of outstanding notes are given the right to direct
the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or
power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the
Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder or that would involve the Trustee
in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and security
(which may include pre-funding) satisfactory to it against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. It
may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the
Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for the Holders to take
action directly.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding by notice to the Trustee may on behalf
of the holders of the notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture except a
continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest or Additional Amounts on, or the principal of, the notes.

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate
indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to
deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after becoming aware of a Default that is continuing, written notice of such event, their
status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of
Default or notice of acceleration may not be given by the Trustee or holders of the notes (or any other action taken on the
assertion of any Default) with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to holders of the notes, more than two years
prior to such notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of default or notice of
acceleration (or other action).

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture, the notes, the Guarantees, the Security Documents, the Escrow Agreement, the
Escrow Charge, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (together, the “Notes Documents”)
may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase
of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such notes) and any existing or past default or compliance with any provisions of such
documents may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes then outstanding
(including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such
notes); provided, in each case, that if any amendment, waiver or other modification will only affect one series of the notes, only


-----

the consent of the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding notes of such series (and not the
consent of at least a majority of all notes then outstanding), shall be required.

However, without the consent of the holders of at least 90% in aggregate principal amount of the notes affected then
outstanding, an amendment, supplement or waiver may not:

(1) reduce the percentage of the aggregate principal amount of notes whose holders must consent to an amendment,
supplement or waiver;

(2) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any note or change the time at which any such premium is payable
as described under “—Optional Redemption;”

(5) make any note payable in money other than that stated in such note;

(6) impair the contractual right of any holder to receive payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such
holder’s notes on or after the due dates therefore or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect
to such holder’s notes;

(7) expressly subordinate the notes or any Guarantee related thereto to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor
other than as contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(8) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Additional Amounts” that adversely affects the
right of any holder of such notes in any material respect or amends the terms of such notes in a way that would result in
a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or
deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the Issuer and the Guarantors agree to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in
respect thereof;

(9) release (i) all or substantially all of the security interests granted for the benefit of the holders in the Collateral or (ii) of
the security interest in the Escrow Collateral or (ii) any Guarantee, in each case, other than pursuant to the terms of the
Security Documents, the Escrow Charge, the Escrow Agreement or the Indenture, as applicable, and except as permitted
by the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(10) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions that require the holders’ consent described in clauses (1) through
(9) of this sentence,

provided that if any such amendment, supplement or waiver will only affect one series of notes then outstanding under the
Indenture and does not or would not affect holders of the notes generally, then only the consent of the holders of not less than
90% in principal amount of the notes of such series then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such series of the notes) shall be required

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any holder of the notes, the Issuer, the Trustee and the Security Agent
(if applicable) may amend any Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a Successor Company of the obligations of the Issuer under any of the documents
referenced above;

(3) provide for the assumption by a Successor Guarantor of the obligations of a Guarantor under any of the documents
referenced above;

(4) add to the covenants of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the benefit of the holders or surrender any right or
power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any holder in any material respect or that would provide any
additional rights or benefits to the holders or the Trustee;

(6) provide for uncertificated notes in addition to or in place of certificated notes;

(7) provide for the issuance of exchange notes or private exchange notes;

(8) comply with the covenant relating to mergers, consolidations and sales of assets;


-----

(9) add or release a Guarantee with respect to the notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and comply with the
provisions described under “—Guarantees” and provide evidence in respect thereof;

(10) provide for the issuance of additional notes permitted to be Incurred under the Indenture;

(11) conform the text of the Indenture, the notes, the Security Documents or the Guarantees to any provision of this
Description of the Notes to the extent that such provision in this Description of the Notes was intended to be a verbatim
recitation of the Indenture, the notes, the Security Documents or the Guarantees;

(12) evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee or security agent; provided that the
successor trustee or security agent, as applicable, is otherwise qualified and eligible to act as such under the terms of any
of the documents referenced above;

(13) provide for the succession of any parties to the Indenture (and other amendments that are administrative or ministerial in
nature) and any of the other documents referenced above;

(14) provide for a reduction in the minimum denominations of the notes;

(15) make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of the notes as permitted
by the Indenture, including, without limitation, to facilitate the issuance and administration of the notes; provided that
compliance with the Indenture as so amended may not result in the notes being transferred in violation of the Securities
Act or any applicable securities laws as determined in good faith by the Issuer;

(16) provide for the assumption by one or more successors of the obligations of any of the Guarantors under any of the
documents referenced above;

(17) comply with the rules of any applicable securities depositary;

(18) mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in favor of the Security Agent (for the benefit of the holders of
the notes or the parties to the Credit Agreement), in any property which is required by the Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement or the Credit Agreement to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security
interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest for the benefit
of any Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited by the Indenture and the covenant
described under “Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with;

(19) make any amendment of an administrative or ministerial nature to the provisions of the Indenture to facilitate an IPO
Pushdown; or

(20) add, release, terminate, discharge or retake the security interests created by the Security Documents or any Guarantees
as provided by the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The consent of the holders of the notes is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment, waiver or consent. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment, waiver or
consent. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any holder of notes given in connection with a tender
of such holder’s notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

The Indenture also will provide that each holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms
and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (whether then entered into or entered
into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter
into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement shall be made available for inspection during normal business hours on any Business Day upon prior written request
at our offices.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to effect an amendment authorized by clauses (3) and (9) above or as contemplated by
the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantors,” in each case in respect of the provision of a
Guarantee for the benefit of the holders of the notes, a supplemental indenture providing for the accession of such Guarantor
shall be duly authorized and executed by the Issuer, such additional Guarantor and the Trustee (and no other party).

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, manager, incorporator or holder of any equity interests in the Issuer or any Parent or any
Guarantor, as such, will have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under the notes, the Guarantees
or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each holder of the
notes by accepting such note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for
issuance of the notes. The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws.


-----

**Transfer and Exchange**

A noteholder may transfer or exchange the notes in accordance with the Indenture. Upon any transfer or exchange, the registrar
and the Trustee may require a noteholder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and
the Issuer may require a noteholder to pay any Taxes required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Issuer is not required
to transfer or exchange any note (i) selected for redemption, (ii) for a period of 15 days prior to the sending of a notice of
redemption or (iii) to be redeemed or tendered and not withdrawn in connection with a Change of Control Offer or an Asset
Sale Offer. The notes will be issued in registered form and the registered holder of a note will be treated as the owner of such
note for all purposes.

The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer
imposed under the Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any note other than to require
delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when
expressly required by the terms of, the Indenture, and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with
the express requirements hereof.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all outstanding notes when:

(1) either (a) all the notes theretofore authenticated and delivered (except lost, stolen or destroyed notes which have been
replaced or paid and notes for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust) have been delivered to the
Trustee for cancellation or (b) all of the notes not delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and
payable, (ii) will become due and payable within one year or (iii) have been or are to be called for redemption within one
year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name,
and at the expense, of the Issuer, and the Issuer or any Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited
with the Trustee (or an entity designated or appointed (as agent) by it for this purpose) money or Euro-denominated
European Government Obligations sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the notes not theretofore
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the notes to the date of deposit
(in the case of notes that have become due and payable) or to the date of maturity or redemption, as applicable, together
with irrevocable instructions from the Issuer directing the Trustee to apply or cause to be applied such funds to the
payment thereof at maturity or redemption, as the case may be, provided that upon any redemption that requires the
payment of the Applicable Premium, as the case may be, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the
indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium, as the case may
be, plus accrued but unpaid interest, in each case calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any deficit
as of the date of the redemption (and any such deficit will be set forth in a written notice delivered to the holders and the
Trustee at least two (2) Business Days prior to the redemption date) only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or
prior to the date of the redemption;

(2) the Issuer and/or the Guarantors have paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; and

(3) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions) stating that all conditions precedent under the Indenture relating to the
satisfaction and discharge of such Indenture have been complied with; provided that any such counsel may rely on such
Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1) and (2)).

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all its obligations and all obligations of the Guarantors under the notes and the Indenture
(“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including those
respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations
of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary notes, registrations of notes, mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held
in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents in effect at such
time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust). The Issuer at any time may terminate its obligations under
certain covenants that are described in the Indenture, including the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants,” the
operation of the cross-acceleration provision, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Issuer and the Significant
Subsidiaries and the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provision described under “—
_Events of Default” and the undertakings and covenants contained under “—Change of Control” and “—Merger, Consolidation_
_or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets” (“covenant defeasance”). If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option or its_


-----

covenant defeasance option, each Guarantor will be released from all of its obligations with respect to its Guarantee and will
cease to be subject to the Indenture.

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant
defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option with respect to the notes, payment of the notes may not be
accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect thereto. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with
respect to the notes, payment of the notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clauses (3),
(4) (with respect to any Default by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries with any of its obligations under the covenants
described under “—Certain Covenants”), (5), (6) (only with respect to a Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer), (7), (8) or
(9) under “—Events of Default.”

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance trust”) with the
Trustee (or an entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this purpose) money or Euro-denominated European
Government Obligations, which shall be delivered to the Trustee, for the payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest
on the notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery
to the Trustee of an Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions to the effect that beneficial owners
of the notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and
defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times
as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and, in the case of legal defeasance only, such
Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling received from or published by the Internal Revenue Service or a change in
applicable U.S. federal income tax law), provided that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable
Premium, as the case may be, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the indenture to the extent that an amount
is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium, as the case may be, plus accrued but unpaid interest, in each
case calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of the date of the redemption (and any such deficit
will be set forth in a written notice delivered to the holders and the Trustee at least two (2) Business Days prior to the redemption
date) only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of the redemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Opinion of Counsel required by the immediately preceding sentence with respect to a legal defeasance need not be delivered
if all notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (x) are due and payable within one year or (y) have been or
will become due and payable within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of
redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer.

**Currency Indemnity**

The sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors under or in connection with
the notes and Guarantees thereof is Euros, including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than
Euros, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or
dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be
due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the
extent of the Euro amount, which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other
currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date
on which it is practicable to do so). If that Euro amount is less than the Euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the
Trustee under any note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the
Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint or several
basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima
facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the holder of a note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory
to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities
constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a
separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any holder of a note or the Trustee
(other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment,
order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any note, any Guarantee or to the Trustee.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained
in the United States against the Issuer or any Guarantor, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium,
interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the notes or the
Guarantees, may not be collectable within the United States.


-----

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture, the notes and the Guarantees,
the Issuer and each Guarantor will, in the Indenture, appoint either (i) a Guarantor organized in the United States or (ii) to the
extent no Guarantor is organized in the United States, the Issuer shall appoint Corporation Service Company (or similar service
provider), in each case as its agent for service of process and irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state
courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New York, United States.

**The Trustee**

Deutsche Trustee Company Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide that, except
during the continuance of an Event of Default of which written notice from the Issuer is given to a responsible officer of the
Trustee in accordance with the notice provisions of the Indenture, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth
specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default, of which written notice from the Issuer is given to a
responsible officer of Trustee in accordance with the notice provisions of the Indenture, the Trustee will exercise such of the
rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting
its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will
not be construed as an obligation or duty. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its
Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, certain taxes and expenses
incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of the Indenture.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture, the notes and the Guarantees, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflicts of law principles to the extent the
law of another jurisdiction would be applied thereby. The Escrow Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement shall be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of England and Wales and the Escrow Charge shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of Germany. The Security Documents shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the applicable Security Jurisdiction.

the specified Person or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries following the Calculation Date;

(5) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed to have been a Restricted Subsidiary
at all times during such four-quarter period;

expense on such Indebtedness will be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Calculation Date had been the applicable
rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligation applicable to such Indebtedness if such Hedging
Obligation has a remaining term as at the Calculation Date in excess of 12 months, or, if shorter, at least equal to the
remaining term of such Indebtedness); and

of the relevant period. Any such pro forma calculation may include adjustments appropriate, in the reasonable good faith

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Notes sold within the United States to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A will initially be represented by one or more
global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Rule 144A Global Notes”). The Notes sold outside the
United States pursuant to Regulation S will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global
**Notes”). On the Issue Date, the Global Notes will be deposited with a common depositary (the “Common Depositary”) for**
the accounts of Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, S.A. (“Clearstream”) and registered in the
name of the nominee of the Common Depositary.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership of
interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the Rule 144A BookEntry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
or persons that hold interests through such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on
behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective
depositories. Except under the limited circumstances described below, Book-Entry Interests will not be issued in definitive
form. The Book-Entry Interests in Global Notes will only be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in
book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective participants. The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in
definitive form. Instead, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit a participant’s account on their book-entry transfer and
registration systems with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain
states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive
form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the
Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or “holders” of Notes for any
purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the Common Depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or its
nominees), as applicable, will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. In
addition, participants in Euroclear and/or Clearstream must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as the case
may be, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and the participants through which they
own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders of Notes under the Indenture.

None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent nor any of their respective agents
will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, will
redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by them in respect of the
redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests
will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such
Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if
fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’
accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and
appropriate; provided, however, that, subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, no Book-Entry Interest of
less than €100,000 in principal amount may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium,
if any, interest and additional amounts, if any) to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent will, in turn, make such payments to
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their
customary procedures. The Issuer will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on account
of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by
law and as described under “Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts.” If any such deduction or withholding is required


-----

to be made, then, to the extent described under “Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts,” the Issuer will pay additional
amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry
Interests after such deduction or withholding will equal the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise
received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. The
Issuer expects that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of
Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent or any of
their respective agents will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (i.e., the Common Depositary (or its nominee)) as
the owners thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the
Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent nor any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility
or liability for:

     - any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or
payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of
Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a
Book-Entry Interest;

    - payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating
to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest; or

     - Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of such
participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers registered in “street name.”

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of the
applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Initial Purchasers, the Paying Agent, the
Registrar, the Transfer Agent nor any of their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a Global Note or any other person
for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from any currency conversion or rounding effected in
connection with any such payment. Holders of Notes may be subject to foreign exchange risks that may have economic and
tax consequences to them.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global Notes will
be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euros.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of
Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are
credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or
participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of
consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under
the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for definitive Notes in registered
form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”), and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their respective participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear’s and
Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of a Note requires physical delivery of
Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in states that require the physical delivery of such
securities or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.


-----

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests in the
Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers as discussed in “Transfer Restrictions.”

Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests
will at all times be subject to the transfer restrictions contained in the legend appearing on the face of the Rule 144A Global
Note, as set forth in “Transfer Restrictions.”

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S
Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the
effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A or any other exemption (if available)
under the Securities Act.

Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement and the closing of the Offering (the
“distribution compliance period”), Regulation S Book-Entry Interests will be limited to persons that have accounts with
Euroclear or Clearstream or persons who hold interests through Euroclear or Clearstream, and any sale or transfer of such
interest to U.S. persons shall not be permitted during such period unless such resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A
under the Securities Act. Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a QIB in a
transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions set forth in
“Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A BookEntry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global
Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global
Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer
restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains
such a Book-Entry Interest.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only as
described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the
Trustee and the Registrar a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply
with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered Notes if:

(i) Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary and
a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days;
(ii) Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an event of default under the Indenture; or
(iii) the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through either Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, following an event of default under the Indenture.

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest described
in the immediately preceding clause (iii), their current procedure is to request that the Issuer issue or cause to be issued Notes
in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in any
approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (in accordance with their
respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of
Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend set forth in “Transfer Restrictions,”
unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.


-----

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and any of
their respective agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no
person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through
registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the
Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry Interests
may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may transfer
such Definitive Registered Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption of
a Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred,
and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the
transferor or the holder, as applicable; provided that a Definitive Registered Note will only be issued in minimum denominations
of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000, in excess thereof. The Issuer will bear the cost of preparing, printing, packaging
and delivering the Definitive Registered Notes. Holders of the Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect
of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes have been
lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are surrendered to the Registrar or
at the office of a Transfer Agent, the Issuer will issue and the Trustee (or its authenticating agent) will authenticate a replacement
Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and the Issuer’s requirements are met. The Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder
requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the
Trustee and the Issuer to protect the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Registrar appointed pursuant to the Indenture
from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. Each of the Issuer, the Registrar and
the Trustee may charge for the expenses of replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become due
and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer in its
discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note,
as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests only in accordance with the
Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer Agent a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes.
See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange. Transfers of
interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in
accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures, which rules and operating procedures may change from time
to time.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of
interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under no obligation
to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None
of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent, nor any of their respective
agents will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect
participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euros. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or Clearstream
accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional euro bonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests
will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day following the
settlement date against payment for value of the settlement date.


-----

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in same-day funds.
Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests
where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are open for business.

In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be complications with completing transactions involving
Clearstream and/or Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States. U.S. investors who wish to transfer their interests
in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery of Notes, on a particular day, may find that the transactions will not
be performed until the next business day in Luxembourg if Clearstream is used, or Brussels if Euroclear is used.

**Clearing Information**

The Issuer expects that the Notes will be accepted for clearance through the facilities of Euroclear and Clearstream.
The international securities identification numbers and common codes numbers for the Notes are set out under “Listing and
_General Information.”_

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

The following description of the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream are provided solely as a
matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and
are subject to changes by them. Neither the Issuer, Trustee nor the Initial Purchasers nor their respective agents take any
responsibility for these operations and procedures and the Issuer urges investors to contact the systems or their participants
directly to discuss these matters.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream:

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and
settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts
of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping,
administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream
also interface with domestic securities markets in several countries. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial
institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect
access to Euroclear or Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear
through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants
and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not
participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the
lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery
of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In
addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to
the Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**Certain Dutch Tax Considerations**

The following summary outlines certain principal Dutch tax consequences of the acquisition, holding, redemption and
disposal of the Notes, but does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all Dutch tax considerations that may be
relevant. For purposes of Dutch tax law, a holder of Notes may include an individual or entity who does not have the legal title
of these Notes, but to whom nevertheless the Notes or the income thereof is attributed based on specific statutory provisions or
on the basis of such individual or entity having an interest in the Notes or the income thereof. This summary is intended as
general information only and each prospective investor should consult a professional tax adviser with respect to the tax
consequences of the acquisition, holding, redemption and disposal of the Notes.

This summary is based on tax legislation, published case law, treaties, regulations and published policy, in each case
as in force as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, and it does not take into account any developments or amendments
thereof after that date whether or not such developments or amendments have retroactive effect.

This summary does not address the Dutch corporate and individual income tax consequences for:

(a) investment institutions (fiscale beleggingsinstellingen);

(b) pension funds, exempt investment institutions (vrijgestelde beleggingsinstellingen) or other Dutch tax
resident entities that are not subject to or exempt from Dutch corporate income tax;

(c) holders of Notes holding a substantial interest (aanmerkelijk belang) or deemed substantial interest (fictief
_aanmerkelijk belang) in the Issuer and holders of Notes of whom a certain related person holds a substantial_
interest in the Issuer. Generally speaking, a substantial interest in the Issuer arises if a person, alone or, where
such person is an individual, together with his or her partner (statutorily defined term), directly or indirectly,
holds or is deemed to hold (i) an interest of 5% or more of the total issued capital of the Issuer or 5% or more
of the issued capital of a certain class of shares of the Issuer, (ii) rights to acquire, directly or indirectly, such
interest or (iii) certain profit-sharing rights in the Issuer;

(d) persons to whom the Notes and the income therefrom are attributed based on the separated private assets
(afgezonderd particulier vermogen) provisions of the Dutch Income Tax Act 2001 (Wet inkomstenbelasting
_2001);_

(e) entities which are a resident of Aruba, Curaçao or Sint Maarten and that have an enterprise which is carried
on through a permanent establishment or a permanent representative on Bonaire, Sint Eustatius or Saba and
the Notes are attributable to such permanent establishment or permanent representative; and

(f) persons to whom the Notes or the income there from are attributable to (deemed) employment activities, a
membership of a management board or a supervisory board or a management role, and which are taxed as
employment income in the Netherlands.

Where this summary refers to the Netherlands, such reference is restricted to the part of the Kingdom of the
Netherlands that is situated in Europe and the legislation applicable in that part of the Kingdom. Where in this summary English
terms and expressions are used to refer to Dutch concepts, the meaning to be attributed to such terms and expressions shall be
the meaning to be attributed to the equivalent Dutch concepts under Dutch tax law.

**_Dutch Withholding Tax_**

All payments made by the Issuer under the Notes may - except in certain very specific cases as described below - be
made free of withholding or deduction for any taxes of whatsoever nature imposed, levied, withheld or assessed by the
Netherlands or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein.

Dutch withholding tax may apply on certain (deemed) interest due and payable to an affiliated (gelieerde) entity of
the Issuer if such entity (i) is considered to be resident (gevestigd) in a jurisdiction that is listed in the yearly updated Dutch
Regulation on low-taxing states and non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes (Regeling laagbelastende staten en niet

-----

_coöperatieve rechtsgebieden voor belastingdoeleinden), or (ii) has a permanent establishment located in such jurisdiction to_
which the interest is attributable, or (iii) is entitled to the interest payable for the main purpose or one of the main purposes to
avoid taxation of another person, or (iv) is not considered to be the recipient of the interest in its jurisdiction of residence
because such jurisdiction treats another (lower-tier) entity as the recipient of the interest (hybrid mismatch), or (v) is not treated
as resident anywhere (also a hybrid mismatch), all within the meaning of the Dutch Withholding Tax Act 2021 (Wet
_bronbelasting 2021)._

**_Corporate and Individual Income Tax_**

_Residents of the Netherlands_

If a holder of Notes is a resident of the Netherlands or deemed to be a resident of the Netherlands for Dutch corporate
income tax purposes and is fully subject to Dutch corporate income tax or is only subject to Dutch corporate income tax in
respect of an enterprise to which the Notes are attributable, income derived from the Notes and gains realised upon the
redemption or disposal of the Notes are generally taxable in the Netherlands (at up to a maximum rate of 25%).

If an individual is a resident of the Netherlands or deemed to be a resident of the Netherlands for Dutch individual
income tax purposes, income derived from the Notes and gains realised upon the redemption or disposal of the Notes are taxable
at the progressive rates (at up to a maximum rate of 49.50%) under the Dutch Income Tax Act 2001, if:

(a) the individual is an entrepreneur (ondernemer) and has an enterprise to which the Notes are attributable or
the individual has, other than as a shareholder, a co-entitlement to the net worth of an enterprise
(medegerechtigde), to which enterprise the Notes are attributable; or

(b) such income or gains qualify as income from miscellaneous activities (resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden),
which includes activities with respect to the Notes that exceed regular, active portfolio management
(normaal, actief vermogensbeheer).

If neither condition (a) nor condition (b) above applies to the holder of the Notes, taxable income with regard to the
Notes must be determined on the basis of a deemed return on savings and investments (sparen en beleggen), rather than on the
basis of income actually received or gains actually realised. This deemed return on savings and investments is fixed at a
percentage of the individual's yield basis (rendementsgrondslag) at the beginning of the calendar year (January 1), insofar as
the individual's yield basis exceeds a statutory threshold (heffingvrij vermogen). The individual's yield basis is determined as
the fair market value of certain qualifying assets held by the individual less the fair market value of certain qualifying liabilities
on January 1. The fair market value of the Notes will be included as an asset in the individual's yield basis. The deemed return
percentage to be applied to the yield basis increases progressively depending on the amount of the yield basis, starting from
1.9% and up to 5.69% per annum of this yield basis. The deemed return on savings and investments is taxed at a rate of 31%.

_Non-residents of the Netherlands_

If a person is neither a resident of the Netherlands nor is deemed to be a resident of the Netherlands for Dutch corporate
or individual income tax purposes, such person is not liable to Dutch income tax in respect of income derived from the Notes
and gains realised upon the redemption or disposal of the Notes, unless:

(a) the person is not an individual and such person (1) has an enterprise that is, in whole or in part, carried on
through a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in the Netherlands to which permanent
establishment or a permanent representative the Notes are attributable, or (2) is, other than by way of
securities, entitled to a share in the profits of an enterprise or a co-entitlement to the net worth of an enterprise,
which is effectively managed in the Netherlands and to which enterprise the Notes are attributable.

This income is subject to Dutch corporate income tax at up to a maximum rate of 25%.

(b) the person is an individual and such individual (1) has an enterprise or an interest in an enterprise that is, in
whole or in part, carried on through a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in the
Netherlands to which permanent establishment or permanent representative the Notes are attributable, or (2)
realises income or gains with respect to the Notes that qualify as income from miscellaneous activities in the
Netherlands which include activities with respect to the Notes that exceed regular, active portfolio


-----

management, or (3) is, other than by way of securities, entitled to a share in the profits of an enterprise that
is effectively managed in the Netherlands and to which enterprise the Notes are attributable.

Income derived from the Notes as specified under (1) and (2) by an individual is subject to individual income
tax at progressive rates up to a maximum rate of 49.50%. Income derived from a share in the profits of an
enterprise as specified under (3) that is not already included under (1) or (2) will be taxed on the basis of a
deemed return on savings and investments (as described above under "Residents of the Netherlands").

**_Gift and Inheritance tax_**

Dutch gift or inheritance taxes will not be levied on the occasion of the transfer of the Notes by way of gift by, or on
the death of, a holder of Notes, unless:

(a) the holder of the Notes is, or is deemed to be, resident in the Netherlands for the purpose of the relevant
provisions; or

(b) the transfer is construed as an inheritance or gift made by, or on behalf of, a person who, at the time of the
gift or death, is or is deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for the purpose of the relevant provisions.

**_Value Added Tax_**

In general, no value added tax will arise in respect of payments in consideration for the issue of the Notes or in respect
of a cash payment made under the Notes, or in respect of a transfer of the Notes.

**_Other Taxes and Duties_**

No registration tax, customs duty, transfer tax, stamp duty, capital tax or any other similar documentary tax or duty
will be payable in the Netherlands by a holder in respect of or in connection with the subscription, issue, placement, allotment,
delivery or transfer of the Notes.

**_The proposed financial transactions tax (FTT)_**

On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the Commission's Proposal) for a Directive
for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the
participating Member States). However, Estonia has since stated that it will not participate.

The Commission's Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the Notes
(including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances.

Under the Commission's Proposal the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of
the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a financial
institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed
to be, "established" in a participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a
person established in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is
issued in a participating Member State.

However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between participating Member States. It may therefore be
altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU Member States may decide to
participate.

Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Pursuant to certain provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, commonly known as FATCA, a foreign
financial institution (as defined by FATCA) may be required to withhold on certain payments it makes (foreign passthru
payments) to persons that fail to meet certain certification, reporting or related requirements. The Issuer may be a foreign
financial institution for these purposes. A number of jurisdictions (including the Netherlands) have entered into, or have agreed


-----

in substance to, intergovernmental agreements with the United States to implement FATCA (IGAs), which modify the way in
which FATCA applies in their jurisdictions. Under the provisions of IGAs as currently in effect, a foreign financial institution
in an IGA jurisdiction would generally not be required to withhold under FATCA or an IGA from payments that it makes.
Certain aspects of the application of the FATCA provisions and IGAs to instruments such as the Notes, including whether
withholding would ever be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as the Notes,
are uncertain and may be subject to change. Even if withholding would be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect
to payments on instruments such as the Notes, such withholding would not apply prior to the date that is two years after the
date on which final regulations defining foreign passthru payments are published in the U.S. Federal Register and the Notes
characterised as debt (or which are not otherwise characterised as equity and have a fixed term) for U.S. federal tax purposes
that are issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which final regulations defining foreign passthru
payments are filed with the U.S. Federal Register generally would be grandfathered for purposes of FATCA withholding unless
materially modified after such date.

Holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes.
In the event any withholding would be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on the Notes, no person
will be required to pay additional amounts as a result of the withholding.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The discussion below is a summary of current U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership
and disposition of Notes. The following summary addresses only U.S. Holders (as defined herein) who purchase the Notes at
the “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of Notes is sold for money, excluding sales to underwriters,
placement agents or wholesalers) in the initial offering and hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221
of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). This summary does not address the tax consequences to
subsequent purchasers of the Notes.

As used herein, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of Notes that is, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation (or other entity treated as a
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state
thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its
source or (iv) a trust (a) that is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and one or more U.S. persons has the authority
to control all of the substantial decisions of the trust or (b) that has made a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury
Regulations (“Treasury Regulations”) to be treated as a U.S. person.

This summary is based upon provisions of the Code and Treasury Regulations, rulings and judicial decisions as of the
date hereof, all of which are subject to change (possibly with retroactive effect), so as to result in U.S. federal income tax
consequences different from those summarized below. The discussion below does not cover all aspects of U.S. federal income
taxation that may be relevant to, or the actual tax effect that any of the matters described herein will have on, the acquisition,
ownership or disposition of Notes by particular investors (including the impact of the unearned income Medicare contribution
tax or the alternative minimum tax), nor does it address any tax consequences arising under U.S. federal estate and gift tax laws
or under the laws of any state, local, non-U.S. or other taxing jurisdiction. In addition, this summary does not address tax
consequences to U.S. Holders who may be subject to special tax treatment, such as banks, dealers, traders that elect to mark to
market, insurance companies, financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, grantor
trusts, U.S. expatriates, tax-exempt entities, persons holding the Notes as part of a hedge, straddle, conversion or other
integrated financial transaction, investors in partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
holders that are required to take certain amounts into income no later than the time such amounts are reflected on an applicable
financial statement or U.S. Holders whose “functional currency” is not the US Dollar. If an entity treated as a partnership for
U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the
partner and the activities of the partnership. A partner of an entity or arrangement that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal
income tax purposes and that is considering holding the Notes is urged to consult its own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal
income tax consequences to it and its partners of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Notes by the partnership.

The summary of U.S. federal income tax consequences set out below is for general information only. Prospective
investors should consult their own tax advisors concerning the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences to them of
owning the Notes, as well as the consequences to them arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction or due to changes
in tax law.


-----

**_Escrow of Proceeds_**

It is possible that the consummation of the Acquisition and the Release may give rise to a deemed exchange of Notes
for “new” notes. We expect to take the position that the consummation of the Merger would not give rise to a deemed exchange
of the notes for new notes. It is possible, however, that the IRS will treat the assumption as a significant modification of the
notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, resulting in a deemed exchange of such notes for “new” notes. If such a position
were taken and sustained, the deemed exchange would be taxable to U.S. Holders. In addition, the deemed exchange could
cause the amount and timing of a U.S. Holder’s income with respect to the notes to differ from that otherwise described herein.
Furthermore, U.S. Holders could recognize ordinary interest income to the extent that any portion of the “new” notes is
attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest on the original notes not previously taxed. The remainder of this discussion
assumes that the assumption will not result in a significant modification of the notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**_Characterization of the Notes_**

In certain circumstances the Issuer may be obligated to make payments on the Notes in excess of stated interest and
principal, including as described in “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption”, “Description of the Notes —Additional
_Amounts” and “Description of the Notes —Change of Control.” The Issuer intends to take the position that there is no more_
than a remote chance that it will make such payments and the Notes should accordingly not be treated as contingent payment
debt instruments (“CPDIs”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes because of these additional payments. The Issuer’s position
is binding on a U.S. holder, unless the U.S. holder discloses in the proper manner to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) that
it is taking a different position. Assuming such position is respected, U.S. Holders would be required to include in income the
amount of any such additional payments at the time such payments are received or accrued in accordance with their method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IRS successfully challenged this position, and the Notes were treated
as CPDIs, U.S. Holders could be required to accrue interest income at a rate higher than the stated interest rate on the Note and
to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any gain recognized on a sale, exchange or redemption of the Note.
Prospective investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential application to the Notes of the CPDI
rules and the consequences thereof.

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

_Euro-Denominated Stated Interest_

Each payment of “qualified stated interest” (including any amounts withheld and any Additional Amounts paid in
respect of withholding taxes imposed on payments on the Notes) will generally be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income
at the time it is received or accrued, depending on the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
The term “qualified stated interest” generally means stated interest that is unconditionally payable at least annually at a
qualifying rate during the entire term of the Note. Stated interest on the Notes will be treated as qualified stated interest.

The amount of income recognized by a cash basis U.S. Holder with respect to a payment of stated interest denominated
in euros will be the US Dollar value of the interest payment based on the “spot rate” (as such term is defined in Treasury
Regulations) on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into US Dollars. A cash basis U.S.
Holder generally will not recognize exchange gain or loss on the interest payment but may recognize exchange gain or loss
when it disposes of any euros it receives (as discussed below under “—Disposition of Euros”).

An accrual basis U.S. Holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to a payment of stated
interest denominated in euros in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, the amount of income accrued
will be based on the average spot rate in effect during the interest accrual period or periods (or, in the case of an accrual period
that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period within each taxable year). Under the second method, the
accrual basis U.S. Holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued on the basis of the spot rate on the last day of
the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the spot rate on the last day of the portion
of the accrual period within each taxable year). Additionally, if the interest payment is actually paid or received within five
business days of the last day of the accrual period, an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder may instead translate the accrued
interest into US Dollars at the spot rate on the day of actual payment or receipt. Any such election will apply to all debt
instruments held by the U.S. Holder from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS.

An accrual basis U.S. Holder who receives a stated interest payment denominated in euros (including a payment
attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note), may recognize U.S.
source exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference between the amount received
(translated into US Dollars at the spot rate on the date of receipt) in respect of such accrual period and the US Dollar value of


-----

the amount of such stated interest payment previously accrued during such accrual period, regardless of whether the payment
is in fact converted into US Dollars. Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated, for foreign tax
credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

_Foreign Tax Credit_

Stated interest paid by the Issuer on the Notes (including any amounts withheld and any Additional Amounts paid in
respect of withholding taxes imposed on payments on the Notes) and OID (as defined below) will generally be considered
income from sources outside the United States and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered
passive category income. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by or on behalf of a U.S. holder at the rate applicable to such
holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject
to applicable limitations (including holding period and at risk rules). There are significant complex limitations on
a U.S. Holder’s ability to claim foreign tax credits. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors concerning the
applicability of the U.S. foreign tax credit and source of income rules to income attributable to the Notes.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

The Notes may be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such event,
U.S. Holders generally will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) for U.S. federal income tax
purposes on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. Holders will include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash
attributable to such income.

The Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds their issue price (as
defined above) by an amount equal to or more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount (generally, 0.0025 multiplied by
the stated principal amount and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date). U.S. Holders of the Notes with
less than the de minimis amount of discount will include the discount on such Notes in income, as capital gain, when principal
payments are made on the Note.

In the event that the Notes are issued with OID, the amount of OID includible in income by a U.S. Holder is the sum
of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in which such
U.S. Holder holds such Note (“accrued OID”). A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period”
a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The “accrual period” of a Note may be of any length and may vary
in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment
of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect
to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of such accrual period
and its yield to maturity, determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for
the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of qualified stated interest allocable to such accrual period. The adjusted issue
price of a Note at the start of any accrual period is equal to its issue price, increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual
period.

For the purposes of determining OID accruals and adjusted issue price only, the amounts of stated interest and OID
are determined by assuming that the interest rate on the Notes is a fixed rate based on the value of the floating rate applicable
to the Notes as of the issue date.

OID, if any, on the Notes will be determined for any accrual period in euros and then translated into US Dollars in
accordance with either of the two alternative methods applicable to accrual basis U.S. Holders described above under “—
_Payments of Stated Interest—Euro Denominated Stated Interest.”_

A U.S. Holder will recognize exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the sale of a Note, the receipt
of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any,
between the US Dollar value of the Euro payment received, determined based on the spot rate on the date such payment is
received, and the US Dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. Exchange gain or loss
generally will be treated as U.S. source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest
income or expense.


-----

**_Disposition of Notes_**

On a sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder will generally recognize gain or loss equal
to the difference between (i) the amount realized on the disposition (less any amount equal to any accrued but unpaid stated
interest, which will be taxable as stated interest income as described above to the extent not previously included in income by
a U.S. Holder) and (ii) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note, in each case as determined in US Dollars.

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will generally equal the “US Dollar cost” of the Note to such holder
increased by any previously accrued OID and decreased by any cash payments on the Note other than qualified stated interest.
U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors about how to account for proceeds received on the sale, retirement or other
taxable disposition of Notes that are not paid in US Dollars

Except as discussed below with respect to exchange gain or loss on a Note attributable to currency fluctuations, any
gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on a taxable disposition of a Note will generally be treated as U.S.-source capital gain
or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if, at the time of the disposition, the Note was held by the U.S. Holder for
more than one year. In the case of an individual U.S. Holder, any long-term capital gain will generally be subject to preferential
U.S. federal income tax rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant limitations. Prospective investors
should consult their own tax advisors as to the foreign tax credit implications of the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition
of the Notes.

The gain or loss that a U.S. Holder realizes on the taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to fluctuations in
currency exchange rates will be taxable as ordinary income or loss and generally will be treated as U.S.-source for U.S. foreign
tax credit limitation purposes. Such exchange gain or loss will generally equal the difference, if any, between the US Dollar
value of the purchase price of the Note based on the spot rate of exchange on (i) the date of the disposition and (ii) the date on
which the U.S. Holder acquired the Note. In addition, upon the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S.
Holder may realize exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest
and accrued OID, if any, which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest” or “—Original Issue
_Discount,” as applicable. However, a U.S. Holder will only realize exchange gain or loss upon the disposition of a Note_
(including any exchange gain or loss attributable to the principal amount of a Note and any exchange gain or loss attributable
to accrued and unpaid stated interest and accrued OID) to the extent of the total gain or loss realized by such holder on the
disposition. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the proper calculation of exchange gain or
loss realized in connection with their acquisition and disposition of the Notes.

**_Disposition of Euros_**

Euros received as interest on a Note or upon the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note generally will
have a tax basis equal to their US Dollar value at the time they are received. Any gain or loss recognized on a sale, retirement
or other taxable disposition of the euros (including their use to purchase Notes or upon their exchange for US Dollars) will be
U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

**_Satisfaction and Discharge_**

If we were to obtain a discharge of the Indenture within one year of maturity or the redemption date with respect to
all of the Notes then outstanding, as described herein under “Description of the Notes—Satisfaction and Discharge” such
discharge would generally be deemed to constitute a taxable exchange of the Notes outstanding for other property. In such case,
a U.S. Holder would be required to recognize capital gain or loss in connection with such deemed exchange. In addition, after
such deemed exchange, a U.S. Holder might also be required to recognize income from the property deemed to have been
received in such exchange over the remaining life of the transaction in a manner or amount that is different than if the discharge
had not occurred. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors as to the specific consequences arising from a discharge in
their particular situations.

**_Foreign Asset Disclosure_**

Individuals (which may include certain entities treated as individuals for the purposes of these rules) that own
“specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in excess of $50,000 on the last day of the tax year or more than
$75,000 at any time during the tax year (or such larger values as specified in the relevant rules) generally are required to file
an information report with respect to such assets with their tax returns. The Notes generally will constitute specified foreign
financial assets subject to these reporting requirements, unless the Notes are held in an account at certain financial institutions.


-----

U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure requirements
to their ownership of the Notes, including the significant penalties for non-compliance.

**_Back-Up Withholding and Information Reporting_**

Generally, information reporting requirements will apply to all payments of principal and interest (including the
accrual of OID, if any) on, or the proceeds from a sale of, a Note, unless the U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient, such as a
corporation. Additionally, if a U.S. Holder (i) fails to furnish its taxpayer identification number (“TIN”), (ii) furnishes an
incorrect TIN, (iii) is notified by the IRS that it failed to properly report certain interest or dividends, or (iv) fails, under certain
circumstances, to provide a certified statement, signed under penalty of perjury, that it is a U.S. person, that the TIN provided
is correct, and that it has not been notified by the IRS that it is subject to backup withholding, it may be subject to back-up
withholding (currently at a rate of 24%).

Back-up withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the back-up withholding rules may be
allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required information is
timely furnished to the IRS. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax.


-----

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of the Notes (or any
interest therein) by (i) employee benefit plans that are subject to the provisions of Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of the U.S.
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), (ii) plans, individual retirement accounts or
arrangements subject to Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Code”), (iii) entities whose
underlying assets include “plan assets of such employee benefit plans, plans, accounts or arrangements (each of the foregoing,
a “Plan”), and (iv) governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section
3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) that, while not subject to Title I of ERISA,
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, may be subject to other federal, state, local or non-U.S. laws or regulations
that are substantially similar to the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code
(“Similar Laws”) (any such governmental, church or non-U.S. plan, a “Similar Law Plan”). This summary is general in nature
and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons
involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering
purchasing the Notes (or any interest therein) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan or any Similar Law Plan, consult
with their own counsel to determine whether such acquisition will violate Title I of ERISA, Section 406 of ERISA, Section
4975 of the Code or any Similar Laws.

**General Fiduciary Considerations**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan and prohibit certain transactions
involving the assets of a Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who
exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of a Plan or the management or disposition of the assets
of a Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation, direct or indirect, to a Plan, is generally considered
to be a fiduciary of the Plan.

When considering an investment in the Notes with the assets of any Plan or any Similar Law Plan, a fiduciary should
determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan or the Similar Law
Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and any Similar Laws relating to the fiduciary’s duties to the Plan or
the Similar Law Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited
transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any Similar Laws.

**Prohibited Transaction Considerations**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit Plans from engaging in specified transactions involving
plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest”, within the meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, or “disqualified
persons”, within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless a statutory or administrative exemption or exception is
applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may
be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code.

The acquisition or holding of the Notes (or any interest therein) by a Plan with respect to which the Issuer, the Trustee,
the Security Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent, the Initial Purchasers, the Escrow Agent, the Guarantors or any of their
respective affiliates (the “Transaction Parties”) are considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or
result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the
investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory or administrative exemption or exception. In this
regard, the U.S. Department of Labor (the “DOL”) has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may
apply to the acquisition and holding of the Notes. These exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 91-38 (relating to
investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by an “independent qualified
professional asset manager”), PTCE 95-60 (relating to investments by an insurance company general account), PTCE 96-23
(relating to transactions directed by an in-house asset manager) and PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company
pooled separate accounts). In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code could provide relief
from the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions
between a Plan and non-fiduciary service providers to the Plan; provided that neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its


-----

affiliates (directly or indirectly) have or exercise any discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with
respect to the assets of any Plan involved in the transaction and provided further that the Plan pays no more than adequate
consideration in connection with the transaction. There can be no assurance that any of the PTCEs or any other exemption or
exception will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes, or that, if any of the PTCEs or another
exemption or exception is available, it will cover all aspects of any particular transaction. Prospective investors should consult
with their advisors regarding the prohibited transaction rules and these exemptions.

Because of the foregoing, the Notes (and interests therein) should not be acquired, held or disposed of by, or on behalf
of, any Plan or any Similar Law Plan, unless such acquisition, holding and disposition would not constitute or result in a nonexempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation of any Similar Laws.

**Plan Asset Considerations**

Regulations promulgated under ERISA by the DOL at 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of
ERISA (together, the “Plan Asset Regulations”), provide that when a Plan acquires an “equity interest” in an entity that is
neither a “publicly offered security” nor a security issued by an investment company registered under the Investment Company
Act, the Plan’s assets include both the equity interest and an undivided interest in each of the underlying assets of the entity
unless it is established either that equity participation in the entity by “benefit plan investors” is not “significant” or that the
entity is an “operating company”, in each case as defined in the Plan Asset Regulations. For purposes of the Plan Asset
Regulations, equity participation in an entity by benefit plan investors will not be significant if benefit plan investors hold, in
the aggregate, less than 25% of the total value of each class of equity interests of such entity, excluding equity interests held by
any person (other than a “benefit plan investor”) who has discretionary authority or control with respect to the assets of the
entity or who provides investment advice for a fee (direct or indirect) with respect to such assets, and any “affiliates” (as defined
in the Plan Asset Regulations) of such person. For purposes of this 25% test, “benefit plan investors” include Plans but exclude
governmental, church and non-U.S. plans.

While the discussion under “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” assumes
the Notes will not be treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such characterisation is not entirely clear, and no
assurances can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not uphold, a different characterisation of the
Notes. In addition, it is anticipated that (i) the Notes will not constitute “publicly offered securities” for purposes of the Plan
Asset Regulations and (ii) the Issuer will not be an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act.

If the Issuer’s assets were deemed to be “plan assets” of a Plan holding the Notes, this would result in, among other
things, (i) the application of the prudence and other fiduciary responsibility standards of ERISA to investments made by the
Issuer, and (ii) the possibility that certain transactions that the Issuer might enter into, or may have entered into, in the ordinary
course of business might constitute or result in non-exempt prohibited transactions under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section
4975 of the Code and might have to be rescinded.

**Representations**

Accordingly, each purchaser and transferee will be deemed to represent, warrant and covenant, for so long as it holds
such Note or any interest therein, that (1) either (A) it is not, and no part of the assets used or to be used by it to acquire or hold
such Note or any interest therein constitutes the assets of, a Plan or a Similar Law Plan or (B)(i) its acquisition, holding and
disposition of such Note or any interest therein will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section
406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation of any Similar Laws, and (ii) none of the Transaction Parties is
undertaking to act as a fiduciary, as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, to the Plan, or any fiduciary
or other person investing the assets of the Plan (“Plan Fiduciary”), with respect to the decision to purchase or hold such Note
or is undertaking to provide any investment recommendation or investment advice or give advice in a fiduciary capacity with
respect to the decision to purchase or hold such Note, and the Plan Fiduciary is exercising its own independent judgement in
evaluating the investment in such Note, and (2) it will not sell or otherwise transfer such Note or any interest therein other than
to a purchaser or transferee that is deemed (or if required by the applicable Indentures, certified) to make these same
representations, warranties and covenants with respect to its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Note or any interest
therein.


-----

The sale of any Notes to a Plan or a Similar Law Plan is in no respect a representation by the Transaction Parties that
such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by Plans or Similar Law Plans generally
or any particular Plan or Similar Law Plan, or that such an investment is appropriate for Plans or Similar Law Plans generally
or any particular Plan or Similar Law Plan.


-----

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement to be entered into between the Issuer, the Initial
Guarantor and the Initial Purchasers in connection with the Notes (the “Purchase Agreement”), the Issuer has agreed to sell
to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Issuer, the entire
principal amount of the Notes.

The Purchase Agreement will provide that the Initial Purchasers are obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase
all the Notes, if any are purchased. Subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, in the event that an Initial
Purchaser fails or refuses to purchase the Notes, which it has agreed to purchase, the purchase commitments of the other Initial
Purchasers may be increased up to a specified amount or the Purchase Agreement may be terminated.

The Purchase Agreement will provide that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of
the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel.

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price indicated on the cover page
hereof. Depending on market conditions, certain of the Initial Purchasers may decide to initially purchase and hold a portion
of the Notes for their own accounts. After the initial offering, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from
time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through
certain of their affiliates, including in respect of sales in the United States. To the extent that any Initial Purchaser that is not a
United States-registered broker dealer intends to effect any sales of the Notes in the United States, it will do so through one or
more United States-registered broker dealers, as permitted under the regulations of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in part.

The Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection with the
Offering and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses.

Funds or entities affiliated with the Sponsor may purchase Notes in the Offering at a purchase price per Note equal to
the issue price set forth on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum on the Issue Date or in the future, and in the case of
investment funds registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), subject to compliance
with the 1940 Act. The Purchase Agreement will not restrict the ability of funds and affiliates of the Sponsor to buy or sell
Notes on the Issue Date or in the future and, as a result, funds and affiliates of the Sponsor may buy or sell the Notes on the
Issue Date or in open market transactions at any time following the consummation of the offering of the Notes.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges
in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page
hereof.

The Purchase Agreement will provide that the Issuer and each of the Guarantors will indemnify and hold harmless the
Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that
the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, not to
offer, sell, contract to sell, issue or otherwise dispose of any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuer and the Guarantors
or any of their subsidiaries for a period of 60 days after the Issue Date.

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act, or the securities laws
of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction. The Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will only offer or sell the
Notes: (i) in the United States to “qualified institutional buyers” within the meaning of Rule 144A; and (ii) outside the United
States in offshore transactions to non-U.S. persons in compliance with Regulation S. Until 40 days after the later of (i) the
commencement of this Offering and (ii) the Issue Date, an offer or sale of Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether
or not it is participating in the Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is
made otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144A. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S.
Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it:

    - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated
any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA)


-----

received by it in connection with the issuance or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the
FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or any Guarantor; and

     - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in
relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by the Issuer or the
Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering
Memorandum or any other material relating to the Issuer or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is
required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor
any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any
country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This
Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where
such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to
inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum
and resale of the Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

The Issuer has also agreed that it will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly
or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the
exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be
applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. Application will be made for the listing
of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. We cannot assure you that the Notes will be
approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market for the Notes as permitted by applicable law.
The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market-making activity may be
discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making
activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. We cannot assure you that any market
for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time
or at a price that will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—If an active trading market for the
_Notes does not develop, the liquidity and value of the Notes could be harmed.”_

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified on the
cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be     business days following the date of pricing of the Notes (this
settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+      ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market
generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly,
purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the next       succeeding business days
will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers
of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors.

In connection with the Offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or a person acting on its behalf, may engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the Offering
size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes
in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate-covering transactions
involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions.
These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise
prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time.
Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk Factors— Risks
_Related to the Notes—If an active trading market for the Notes does not develop, the liquidity and value of the Notes could be_
_harmed.”_

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities,
which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management,
principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates have
provided in the past, and are currently providing, or may in the future provide, various lending, financial advisory, investment
banking, corporate finance, commercial banking services and/or other banking services to us and our affiliates in the ordinary
course of business, including in connection with the Acquisition. They have received, and expect to receive, customary fees


-----

and commissions for these transactions. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates have provided
commitments with respect to certain bridge loan facilities in relation to the Acquisition, which are expected to be cancelled
following the issuance of the Notes. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates will act as
mandated lead arrangers, underwriters and bookrunners, as applicable, under the Term Loan B Facility and the Revolving
Credit Facility, which we will enter into as borrowers and draw to provide financing for the Acquisition and to finance or
refinance our working capital and general corporate purposes, as applicable. In addition, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch
and Barclays Bank PLC and/or their respective affiliates will act as the security agent and facility agent, respectively, under
Credit Facilities Agreement. Also, certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates have provided and may
continue to provide bank guarantees, letters of credit, working capital facilities, receivables securitizations, factoring or reverse
factoring, supplier financing or similar arrangements to the Group. The relevant Initial Purchasers and/or their respective
affiliates have received, and expect to receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions, certain of which are
payable with proceeds from the issuance of the Notes.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates
may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities)
and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments
and securities activities may involve our securities and/or instruments or those of our affiliates. The Initial Purchasers and/or
their respective affiliates that have a lending relationship with us may routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent
with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates would hedge
such exposure by entering into transactions that consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short
positions in securities, including, potentially, the Notes. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices
of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish
or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to
clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

_You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of any of the Notes_
_offered hereby._

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act, or the securities laws
of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction, and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant
to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable
securities laws of such state or other jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Issuer is offering and selling the Notes to the Initial
Purchasers for re-offer and resale only:

We use the terms “offshore transaction,” “U.S. person” and “United States” with the meanings given to them in
Regulation S.

Each purchaser of Notes, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to and agreed
with the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

(1) It understands and acknowledges that the Notes and the Guarantees are being offered for resale in transactions
not requiring registration under the Securities Act, or the securities laws of any state of the United States or
any other jurisdiction, that the Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the
Securities Act, or the securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction, and, unless so
registered, may not be offered, resold, pledged or otherwise transferred, except in compliance with the
registration requirements of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws pursuant to an
exemption therefrom or in any transaction not subject thereto and in each case in compliance with the
conditions for transfer set out in paragraphs (4) and (5) below.

(2) It is neither the Issuer’s nor any Guarantor’s “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144 of the Securities Act), nor
acting on the Issuer’s or any Guarantor’s behalf and that either:

(a) it is a QIB, within the meaning of Rule 144A, and is aware that any sale of these Notes to it will be
made in reliance on Rule 144A, and such acquisition of Notes will be for its own account or for the
account of another QIB; or

(b) it is a non-U.S. person purchasing the Notes outside the United States in an offshore transaction in
accordance with Regulation S.

(3) It acknowledges that none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, or the Initial Purchasers, nor any person representing
any of them, has made any representation to it with respect to the Issuer and its subsidiaries or the offer or
sale of any of the Notes, other than the information contained in this Offering Memorandum, which Offering
Memorandum has been delivered to it and upon which it is relying in making its investment decision with
respect to the Notes. It acknowledges that neither the Initial Purchasers nor any person representing the Initial
Purchasers make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of this Offering
Memorandum. It has had access to such financial and other information concerning the Issuer and its
subsidiaries and the Notes that it deems necessary in connection with its decision to purchase any of the
Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of, and request information from, the Issuer and the Initial
Purchasers.

(4) It is purchasing the Notes for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which it is acting as
a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection
with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction,
subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor account
or accounts be at all times within its or their control and subject to its or their ability to resell such Notes


-----

pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other exemption from registration available under the Securities
Act, or in any transaction not subject to the Securities Act.

(5) It agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is purchasing the Notes, and
each subsequent holder of the Notes by its acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, to offer, sell or
otherwise transfer such Notes or any beneficial interests in such Notes prior to the date (the “Resale
**Restriction Termination Date”) that is, in the case of the Rule 144A Notes, one year after the later of the**
original issue date of such Notes, the original issue date of any Additional Notes and the last date on which
the Issuer or any of its affiliates were the owner of such Notes (or any predecessor thereto) or, in the case of
the Regulation S Notes, 40 days after the later of the original issue date of such Notes (or, if later, the issue
date of any Additional Notes) and the last date on which such Notes (or any predecessor thereto) were first
offered to persons other than distributors (as defined in Rule 902 of Regulation S), only (i) to the Issuer, the
Guarantors or any subsidiary thereof; (ii) pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared effective
under the Securities Act; (iii) for so long as the Notes are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a
person it reasonably believes is a QIB that purchases for its own account or for the account of a QIB to whom
notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A; (iv) to non-U.S. persons pursuant to
offers and sales that occur outside the United States in offshore transactions in compliance with Regulation
S; or (v) pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act,
subject in each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the
property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and to compliance
with any applicable state securities laws, and any applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject
to the Issuer’s and the Trustee’s rights prior to any such offer, sale or transfer (I) pursuant to clause (v) above
to require the delivery of an opinion of counsel, certification and other information satisfactory to each of
them and (II) in each of the foregoing cases, to require that a certificate of transfer in the form appearing on
the reverse of the Note is completed and delivered by the transferor to the Trustee. The foregoing restrictions
on resale will not apply subsequent to the Resale Restriction Termination Date.

(6) Each purchaser acknowledges that each Note will contain a legend substantially to the following effect:

THIS NOTE HAS NOT BEEN, AND WILL NOT BE, REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES
ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”), OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY

SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THE PROHIBITED TRANSACTION PROVISIONS OF SECTION 406

A purchaser of Notes will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions apply to holders of beneficial
interests in these Notes as well as to holders of these Notes.

(7) It agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers the Notes notice of any restrictions on the transfer
of such Notes.


-----

(8) It acknowledges that until 40 days after the commencement of the Offering, any offer or sale of the Notes
within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate the registration
requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A.

(9) It acknowledges that the Transfer Agent or the Registrar will not be required to accept for registration or
transfer any Notes acquired by it except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to the Issuer, the Transfer
Agent and the Registrar that the restrictions set out therein have been complied with.

(10) It acknowledges that the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the
acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements and agrees that if any of the
acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements deemed to have been made by its purchase
of the Notes are no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers. If it is
acquiring any Notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, it represents that it has sole
investment discretion with respect to each such investor account and that it has full power to make the
foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf of each such investor account.

(11) It understands that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by the Issuer or
the Initial Purchasers that would result in a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to the Issuer or the Notes in any
jurisdiction where action for such purpose is required. Consequently, any transfer of the Notes will be subject
to the selling restrictions set out under “Plan of Distribution” and “Important Information for Investors—
_Notice to Certain Investors.”_

**ERISA Considerations**

Any purchaser, transferee or holder of the Notes (or any interest therein) will be deemed to have represented, warranted
and covenanted in its individual, corporate and fiduciary (if applicable) capacity that:

(a) With respect to the acquisition, holding and disposition of the Notes or any interest therein (and for so long
as it holds such Notes or any interest therein), (1) either (A) it is not, and no part of the assets used or to be
used by it to acquire or hold such Notes or any interest therein constitutes the assets of, (i) an employee
benefit plan subject to the provisions of Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), (ii) any plan, individual retirement account or
arrangement subject to Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”),
(iii) an entity whose underlying assets include “plan assets” of such employee benefit plans, plans, accounts
or arrangements (each of the foregoing, a “Plan”) or (iv) a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan that is
subject to any federal, state, local or non-U.S. laws or regulations that are substantially similar to the
prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar Laws”),
or (B) (i) its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Notes or any interest therein will not constitute or
result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a
violation of any Similar Laws; and (ii) none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Registrar, the
Transfer Agent, the Initial Purchasers, the Escrow Agent or the Guarantors or any of their respective affiliates
is undertaking to act as a fiduciary, as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, to the
Plan, or any fiduciary or other person investing the assets of the Plan (“Plan Fiduciary”), with respect to the
decision to purchase or hold such Notes or is undertaking to provide any investment recommendation or
investment advice or give advice in a fiduciary capacity with respect to the decision to purchase or hold such
Notes, and the Plan Fiduciary is exercising its own independent judgement in evaluating the investment in
such Notes; and (2) it will not sell or otherwise transfer such Notes or any interest therein other than to a
purchaser or transferee that is deemed (or if required by the applicable Indentures, certified) to make these
same representations, warranties and covenants with respect to its acquisition, holding and disposition of
such Notes or any interest therein.

(b) The acquirer and any fiduciary causing it to acquire the Notes (or any interest therein) agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless the Issuers, the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent, the Initial
Purchasers, the Escrow Agent or the Guarantors and their respective affiliates, from and against any cost,
damage or loss incurred by any of them as a result of any of the foregoing representations, warranties and
covenants being or becoming false.


-----

(c) Any purported acquisition or transfer of any Note or beneficial interest therein to a purchaser or transferee
that does not comply with the requirements of the above provisions shall be void ab initio.

**LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY**
**INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS**

_The following is a summary of certain limitations on the validity and enforceability of any Guarantees and the security_
_interests being provided for the Notes, and a summary of certain insolvency law considerations in the European Union,_
_Netherlands, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. The description below is only a summary, and does not_
_purport to be complete or to discuss all the limitations or considerations that may affect the validity and enforceability of the_
_Notes or any Guarantees or security interests being provided for the Notes. Prospective investors in the Notes should consult_
_their own legal advisors with respect to such limitations and considerations._

In the event that the Issuer, the Guarantors or any provider of collateral experiences financial difficulty, it is not
possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings will be commenced,
or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer,
the Guarantors and the collateral provided by any other company. The insolvency, administration and other laws of the
jurisdictions in which the respective companies are organized or operate may be materially different from, or conflict with,
each other and there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in
relation to one another.

**European Union**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors or security providers are incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, or
in other jurisdictions which are also members states of the European Union (each, a “Member State”).

**_Main Insolvency Proceedings_**

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency
proceedings (recast), as amended (the “Recast Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within the European Union, other than
Denmark, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open the main insolvency proceedings in relation to a company (subject to
certain exceptions) is the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) in which the relevant company’s centre of main
interests (“COMI”) (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation) is situated. The Recast Insolvency
Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings opened before the end of the “implementation period” under the terms of the
Withdrawal Agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union which period ended on December 31, 2020.
There is therefore no guarantee that, thereafter, UK insolvency proceedings will be respected elsewhere within the European
Union. Please see the section headed “The European Union and the United Kingdom” below for more information in this
respect.

COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time, but is determined for the purposes of deciding which
court has competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition: moreover,
the determination of where a debtor has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may
have differing and even conflicting views. Article 3(1), second sentence, of the Recast Insolvency Regulation states that a
company’s COMI “shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which
_is ascertainable by third parties.” Under Article 3(1) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation there is, in most cases, a rebuttable_
presumption that a corporate debtor has its centre of main interests in the Member State in which it has its registered office in
the absence of proof to the contrary. The presumption only applies if the registered office has not been moved to another
Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Recital 30 of the
Recast Insolvency Regulation contains a number of examples of where a presumption as to COMI may be rebutted: for instance,
where the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a
comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the
company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member
State. In that respect, the factors that courts may take into consideration when determining the centre of main interests of a
debtor can include where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its
head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established and where they recognize as being the
centre of the company’s operations.

Furthermore, the courts of the member state within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened
in accordance with Article 3 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly
from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions.


-----

Pursuant to Article 4 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings will be
required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation; such decision may
be challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction.

**_Secondary or Territorial Proceedings_**

If the centre of main interests of a debtor, at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in a Member State
(other than Denmark), only the courts of that Member State have jurisdiction to open the main insolvency proceedings in
respect of the debtor under the Recast Insolvency Regulation and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to
commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the Recast Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency
proceedings commenced in one Member State under the Recast Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other Member
States (other than Denmark), although secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings may be
commenced in another Member State (other than Denmark).

If the centre of main interests of a debtor, at the time an insolvency application is made, is in a Member State (other
than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than
Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings against that
debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (as defined in Article 2(10) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation) in the
territory of such other Member State. Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the Recast
Insolvency Regulation and, for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding-up proceedings. Territorial proceedings are,
in effect, secondary proceedings that are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment”
is defined to mean “any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to
_the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.”_
Accordingly, the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings in another Member State
(other than Denmark) will also be possible if the debtor had an establishment in such Member State in the three-month period
prior to the request for opening of main insolvency proceedings.

The effects of those secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings opened in that other
Member State are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. Pursuant to Article
3(4) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its centre of
main interests have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member
State (other than Denmark) where the debtor has an establishment and either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced
in the Member State in which the debtor’s centre of main interests is situated under the conditions laid down by that Member
State’s law; or (ii) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (a) a creditor whose claim arises from or is
in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of
territorial proceedings is requested, or (b) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of
which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. When main insolvency
proceedings are opened, territorial insolvency proceedings usually become secondary insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of
whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject
to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed
jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. Those exceptions include certain ‘safe harbors’ which disapply the
_lex fori concursus of the relevant proceedings in respect of certain acts and rights. For example, rights in rem (which include_
the rights of creditors to take enforcement action against, and dispose of, the assets of the company which is subject to the
relevant insolvency proceedings) may not be affected by the company’s lex fori concursus and are instead subject to the
governing laws which apply to the relevant arrangement under which the creditor obtains such rights.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main
proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary insolvency proceedings
or territorial insolvency proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in the
Member State which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of
that Member State in another Member State (other than Denmark) (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other
Member State). These powers are subject to certain limitations (e.g., the powers are available provided that no insolvency
proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State nor any preservation measure to the contrary has been taken
there further to a request to commence secondary proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets).

However, under Article 36 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency
proceedings may prevent the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State by giving a unilateral
undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened.
For this purpose, the insolvency practitioner must undertake to comply with the distribution and priority rights under the


-----

relevant national law from which the local creditors would benefit if the insolvency proceedings were opened in the member
state where the assets are located. Such an undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a qualified
majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with applicable local laws. If approved, the undertaking is binding
on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it should, at the request of the
insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceeding if it is satisfied that the undertaking
adequately protects the general interests of local creditors.

Additionally, where a temporary stay of individual enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for
negotiations between a company and its creditors, the court seized of a request to open secondary insolvency proceedings may,
at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, stay the opening of secondary insolvency
proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of
local creditors. The court which opened the secondary insolvency proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets
in whole or in part on receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of
up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such
stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods (i.e., up to three months). Where the court stays the process of realization
of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure
to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors.

**_Insolvency Proceedings Involving Members of a Group of Companies_**

In addition, the concept of “group coordination proceedings” has been introduced in the Recast Insolvency Regulation
with the aim of bolstering communication and efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a group of companies. Under
Article 61 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having
jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency
proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Participation in group coordination proceedings and adherence to the
coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations or plan however is voluntary. Prior to taking the decision to participate
or not to participate in the coordination, an insolvency practitioner shall obtain any approval, which may be required under the
law of the state of the opening of proceedings for which it has been appointed.

In the event that the Issuer and/or any Guarantor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with
certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such
proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Issuer and/or
any Guarantor. The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective companies are
organized or operate may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and there is no assurance as to how the
insolvency laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one another.

**_EU Directive on Preventive Restructuring Frameworks_**

The EU directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of June 20, 2019 on preventive restructuring
frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning
restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and
insolvency) (the “EU Restructuring Directive”) was published on June 26, 2019.

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that (i) viable enterprises and entrepreneurs that are in
financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring frameworks that enable them to continue
operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs (i.e. individuals) can benefit from a full discharge of debt after
a reasonable period of time, thereby allowing them a second chance and (iii) the effectiveness of procedures concerning
restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in particular with a view to shortening their length.

The EU Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of restructuring,
insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards for preventive restructuring
procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs in order to promote a culture that
encourages early preventive restructuring to address financial difficulties at an early stage, when it appears likely that
insolvency can be prevented and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most notably, the EU Restructuring Directive
provides for a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of individual enforcement actions by creditors against debtors must be
introduced by Member States national legislation, (b) all creditor claims shall be grouped into separate classes each of which
shall reflect a commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate
classes), (c) creditor claims may be restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75%
of the amount of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number of affected parties in


-----

each class and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may, under certain conditions, be adopted
and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the
required majority. In order to be adopted the plan will have to be confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority that will
in particular ensure the protection of each type of creditors’ rights and compliance with the priority rules governing the adoption
of the plan.

The EU Restructuring Directive must be transposed into national laws or regulations by Member States by July 17,
2021 (with the exception of the provisions relating to the use of electronic means of communication for which the time period
for the transposition expires in certain respects on July 17, 2024 or, in others respects, on July 17, 2026), subject to a maximum
one year extension of the transposition period for Member States encountering particular difficulties in implementing the EU
Restructuring Directive.

**The European Union and the United Kingdom**

**_The Position post-Brexit_**

Insolvency proceedings commenced in the United Kingdom prior to December 31, 2020 retain the benefit of the
Recast Insolvency Regulation. Following December 31, 2020, the United Kingdom has left the scope of the Recast Insolvency
Regulation.

The laws of the United Kingdom have, by the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (the “Exit
**Regulations”) retained certain provisions of the Recast Insolvency Regulation. The primary effect of the Exit Regulations is**
to preserve the grounds of jurisdiction for the Courts of the United Kingdom to open insolvency proceedings which the Recast
Insolvency Regulation had previously established. Consequently, a company may still be placed into insolvency proceedings
in the United Kingdom if its COMI is in the United Kingdom or if its COMI is in a Member State but the company has an
establishment in the United Kingdom. These grounds are however expressed in the Exit Regulations as being supplemental to
any other grounds to open insolvency proceedings which apply in the laws of any part of the United Kingdom. Such grounds
include the jurisdiction of the Courts of the United Kingdom to wind up any unregistered company (including an overseas
company) under the United Kingdom’s insolvency laws provided that the Courts consider that the company has a sufficient
connection to the United Kingdom for it to be able to do so, and to place a company in a European Economic Area (“EEA”)
state, or having its COMI in an EEA state into certain types of insolvency proceeding in the United Kingdom.

The Exit Regulations have however removed large parts of the Recast Insolvency Regulation from English law. This
means that, amongst other things, insolvency proceedings commenced in the United Kingdom are no longer granted automatic
recognition in each Member State and insolvency proceedings commenced in a Member State are no longer granted automatic
recognition in the United Kingdom.

**_Inbound Recognition of Insolvency Proceedings Commenced in Overseas Territories_**

The position regarding the recognition and coordination of insolvency proceedings in the United Kingdom and the
Member States has become more complex since December 31, 2020. As regards the recognition of insolvency proceedings
commenced in an overseas territory, the Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (the “CBIR”), which incorporate the
provisions of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (the “Model Law”), enable the Courts of the United
Kingdom to grant various forms of relief in respect of overseas insolvency proceedings. Such forms of relief include the
recognition of an overseas insolvency proceeding in the United Kingdom and the right for the officeholder in such overseas
insolvency proceeding to bring claims in respect of antecedent transactions (each of which is discussed in the section headed
“England and Wales” below). If recognition is granted, the overseas proceeding will be classed as either foreign main
proceedings (which benefit from an automatic stay on certain types of enforcement action by creditors) or foreign non-main
proceedings (in respect of which a stay is not automatic, and is instead imposed at the Court’s discretion), depending on whether
or not the company’s COMI is situated in the jurisdiction of the relevant proceedings. Consequently, although there is no longer
automatic recognition in the United Kingdom of insolvency proceedings commenced in Member States, the CBIR provides a
well-established path for the recognition of such proceedings through the Courts of the United Kingdom.

In addition to the CBIR, Section 426 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (the “IA86”) enables any Court in the United
Kingdom to assist the Courts with corresponding insolvency jurisdiction in any other part of the United Kingdom or any
relevant country or territory, and to apply comparable insolvency law applicable by either Court. Such territories include the
Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, the Republic of Ireland and a number of Commonwealth and former Commonwealth members
whose laws are based on common law systems, some of which have similar provisions to assist courts in the United Kingdom.
Through this mechanism, insolvency officeholders in the relevant territories are able to request that the Courts of those


-----

territories request the assistance of the Courts of the United Kingdom, which may include the recognition of the overseas
insolvency proceedings.

**_Outbound Recognition of Insolvency Proceedings Commenced in the United Kingdom_**

The recognition in Member States of insolvency proceedings which have been commenced in the United Kingdom is
less straightforward. Where Member States have enacted laws to incorporate the Model Law into their domestic legislation,
recognition can be sought by the use of those laws in a similar way to the recognition of insolvency proceedings by the Courts
of the United Kingdom via the CBIR. However, as at the Issue Date, the only Member States to have adopted the Model Law
are Poland, Slovenia, Romania and Greece.

If insolvency proceedings are commenced in the United Kingdom and the officeholder determines that those
proceedings ought to be recognized in a Member State which has not enacted the Model Law (for example, because the
company owns valuable assets which are situated in that Member State), an application will be required to the Courts of that
Member State for recognition under its domestic laws.

The absence of automatic recognition of insolvency proceedings which are commenced in the United Kingdom also
means that the Courts of the Member States are no longer bound to adhere to a determination by the Courts of the United
Kingdom regarding the location of a company’s COMI. It is therefore now possible for the Courts of the United Kingdom and
the Courts of a Member State to adopt differing views regarding a company’s COMI and, as a result, where main insolvency
proceedings can be commenced against it. However, whereas the Courts of the other Member States will be bound to follow
the determination of the Courts of the relevant Member State regarding the location of the company’s COMI, there is now
nothing to bind the Courts of those Member States to a decision given by the Courts of the United Kingdom.

The possibility now exists that competing insolvency proceedings could be commenced in the United Kingdom and a
Member State with no overarching framework to assist with the coordination and recognition of those proceedings. It is
therefore not possible to predict with certainty whether insolvency proceedings commenced against any subsidiary guarantor
which is incorporated in the United Kingdom will be recognized by the Courts of any relevant Member State, nor how the
Courts of Member States will assist with the coordination of any insolvency proceedings and the preservation and enforcement
of creditors’ rights. Applicable insolvency laws may therefore affect the ease and effectiveness of the recovery of claims against
any relevant subsidiary guarantor.

**The Netherlands**

**_Insolvency Considerations_**

Subject to the limitations described under “—European Union,” where a company incorporated in the Netherlands or
elsewhere) has its “centre of main interests” or an “establishment” in the Netherlands, it may be subjected to Dutch insolvency
proceedings. This is particularly relevant for the Issuer and certain of the Guarantors, which have their corporate seats
(statutaire zetel) in the Netherlands, and are therefore each presumed (subject to proof to the contrary) to have their “centre of
main interests” in the Netherlands. Dutch insolvency law differs significantly from insolvency proceedings in the U.S. and
other jurisdictions, and may make it more difficult for holders of Notes to recover the amount they would normally expect to
recover in a liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding in the U.S. or another jurisdiction.

The following is an outline of certain aspects of Dutch law and practice relating to insolvency laws. This is not a
complete summary of currently applicable Dutch law or practice, and should not be treated as a substitute for professional
advice. Prospective holders of Notes who are in any doubt as to any matter described in this offering memorandum should
consult their own professional advisors.

**_General_**

There are three applicable corporate insolvency regimes under Dutch law in relation to corporations: (a) suspension
of payments (surseance van betaling), which is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s debts and enable the debtor
to continue as a going concern, (b) statutory composition proceedings, which is also intended to facilitate the reorganization of
a debtor’s debts and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern and (c) bankruptcy (faillissement), which is primarily
designed to liquidate and distribute the debtor’s assets to its creditors. In practice a suspension of payments often results in the
bankruptcy of the debtor. All insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). A general
description of the principles of those insolvency regimes is set out below. This general description is subject to the proposals


-----

discussed under the heading “Temporary Legislation to Protect Enterprises in Financial Distress due to the COVID-19
_Pandemic” below._

**_Suspension of Payments_**

An application for a suspension of payments can only be made by the debtor itself, if it foresees that it will be unable
to continue to pay its payable debts. Once the request for a suspension of payments is filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk)
grant a provisional suspension of payments and appoint one or more administrators (bewindvoerders). A meeting of creditors
is required to decide on the definitive suspension of payments. If a draft composition (ontwerpakkoord) is filed simultaneously
with the application for a suspension of payments, the court can order that the composition will be processed before a decision
about a definitive suspension of payments.

If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional suspension of
payments ends. The definitive suspension of payments will generally be granted unless a qualified minority (i.e. more than one
quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one-third of the number of
creditors represented at such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured non-preferential creditors declare against it. The granting of
a definitive suspension of payments can also be withheld if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors
during a suspension of payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future.

A suspension of payments takes effect retroactively from 0.00 hours on the day on which the court has granted the
provisional suspension of payments.

The suspension of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured non-preferential creditors. Under Dutch law
secured and preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may enforce their rights against assets of the
company in suspension of payments to satisfy their claims as if there were no suspension of payments. A recovery under Dutch
law could, therefore, involve a sale of assets that does not reflect the going concern value of the debtor. However, at the request
of an interested party or by its own volition the court can order a “cooling down period” (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum
period of two months (which can be extended by the court once for another period of two months) during which enforcement
actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred.

Also in a definitive suspension of payments, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will
be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a simple majority of the number of creditors
represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged and admitted in
the suspension of payments, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court.

Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the holders of the Notes to effect a
restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of Notes in a Dutch suspension of payments proceeding. Interest
accruing after the date on which a suspension of payments is granted, cannot be claimed in a composition.

Under Dutch law, as soon as a definitive suspension of payments is granted or the composition is ratified by a court,
in principle, all pending executions of judgments against the relevant debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor’s assets
(other than with respect of secured creditors and certain other creditors, as described above), will be suspended or cancelled by
operation of law.

**_Statutory Composition Proceedings_**

With the entry into force of the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans (Wet homologatie
_onderhands akkoord) (the "WHOA") on January 1, 2021, debtors now have the possibility to offer a composition outside of_
formal insolvency proceedings. The WHOA is inspired by the UK Scheme of Arrangements and the US Chapter 11 procedure
and it offers debtors additional possibilities to restructure their debt. Unlike a composition in suspension of payments and in
bankruptcy proceedings, a composition under the WHOA can be offered to secured creditors as well as shareholders. The
WHOA provides, inter alia, for cross class cramdown, the restructuring of group company obligations through aligned
proceedings, the termination of onerous contracts, the suspension of certain ipso facto clauses in contracts and supporting court
measures. A WHOA composition may result in claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors being compromised if the relevant
majority votes in favor of such a composition and it is subsequently confirmed by the Dutch courts. A composition plan under
the WHOA can extend to claims against entities that are not incorporated under Dutch law and/or are residing outside the
Netherlands. Accordingly, the WHOA can affect the rights of the Trustee and/or the holders of the Notes under the Indenture
and therefore the Notes.


-----

Voting on a WHOA composition plan is done in classes. A class is deemed to accept the plan if two third of the total
amount of the debt of that class or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two thirds of the share capital of that class, participating
in the vote, votes in favor. The WHOA provides for the possibility for a composition plan to be binding on a dissenting class
(i.e., cross class cramdown). Under the WHOA, the court will confirm a composition plan if at least one class of creditors (other
than a class of shareholders) that can be expected to receive a distribution in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor approves the
plan, unless there is a statutory ground for refusal. The court can, inter alia, refuse confirmation of a composition plan on the
basis of (i) a request by a dissenting creditor, if the value of the distribution that such creditor receives under the plan is lower
than the distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or (ii) a request of a dissenting creditor
in a dissenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value that deviates from the statutory or contractual ranking and
priority to the detriment of that class, unless there is a reasonable ground to do so. There is one mandatory refusal ground
specifically applicable to secured financial creditors. If the composition plan entails a debt-for-equity swap to which such
creditors do not want to ascribe, and these creditors do not have the right to opt for a different kind of distribution, the court
will refuse confirmation of such plan on the request of such creditor.

Under the WHOA, the court may grant a stay on enforcement of a maximum of four months, with a possible extension
of four months. For the duration of such moratorium, all enforcement action against the assets of (or in the possession of) the
debtor is suspended unless with the court’s approval, including action to enforce security over the assets of the debtor or, in
case of an undisclosed right of pledge over receivables, the collection, or notification to the debtors. Furthermore, any petitions
for bankruptcy in respect of the debtor are suspended and the court may lift attachments on the debtor’s assets at the request of
the debtor or restructuring expert.

**_Bankruptcy_**

Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. Bankruptcy can be requested
by a creditor of the debtor or the holder of a security interest over a claim from such creditor, when there is at least one other
creditor. At least one of the claims (of the creditor requesting bankruptcy or the other creditor) needs to be due and payable.
Bankruptcy can also be declared in certain circumstances when a debtor is subject to a suspension of payments. The debtor can
request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself, provided it has obtained prior approval of its general meeting to file
an application for its bankruptcy. The articles of association of the debtor can preclude the necessity of such general meeting
approval. Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service (het Openbaar Ministerie) can request the application of bankruptcy
proceedings for reasons of public interest (openbaar belang).

There is no legal duty for a debtor to file for its own bankruptcy. However, if the managing board of a company realizes
that the company is or will be unable to pay its debts when they come due, it is required to take appropriate measures, which
could include the cessation of trading, notification of creditors and the filing for either bankruptcy or a suspension of payments
(see above).

As a result of a bankruptcy, the debtor loses all rights to administer and dispose of its assets. A bankruptcy order takes
effect retroactively from 0.00 hours on the day the order is rendered.

During a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed to
the debtor’s creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims. The general principle of Dutch
insolvency law is the paritas creditorum (principle of equal treatment), which means that all creditors have an equal right to
payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy proceedings shall be distributed in proportion to the size of their respective claims.
However, certain creditors (such as secured creditors and tax and social security authorities) will have special rights that take
priority over the rights of other creditors. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could reduce a holder of a Note’s potential
recovery in a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding.

All unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims, need to be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy for verification, and the
receiver in bankruptcy makes a determination as to the existence, ranking and value of the claim and whether and to what extent
it should be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings. The valuation of claims that otherwise would not have been payable at
the time of the bankruptcy proceeding may be based on a net present value analysis. Interest accruing after the date of the
bankruptcy cannot be verified unless secured by a pledge or mortgage, in which case interest will be admitted pro memoria.
The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the holders of the Notes may be challenged in a Dutch bankruptcy
proceeding. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting (verificatievergadering), the bankruptcy receiver (curator), the insolvent debtor
and all verified creditors may dispute the verification of claims of other creditors. Creditors whose claims or value thereof are
disputed in the creditors’ meeting may be referred to separate court proceedings (renvooiprocedure). These renvooi proceedings
could cause holders of the Notes to recover less than the principal amount of their Notes or less than they could recover in other
liquidation proceedings. Such renvooi proceedings could also cause payments to the holders of the Notes to be delayed


-----

compared with holders of undisputed claims. Creditors of secured claims and preferential creditors with respect to certain assets
of a debtor, who expect that the proceeds of a future enforcement against the assets subject to the security or their preferred
rights, as the case may be, will be insufficient to satisfy their claim in full, may request to receive the same rights as unsecured
and non-preferential creditors with respect to the expected remainder of their claim, with preservation of their rights as a secured
or preferential creditor in respect of the secured asset or the asset the relevant preferential right relates to. If a secured creditor
enforces its security rights prior to the expiry of the period for submitting claims for verification, and the proceeds of such
enforcement are insufficient to satisfy its claim in full, the remainder of that claim may be submitted to the receiver in
bankruptcy in order to be verified.

Secured creditors may enforce their rights against assets of the debtor to satisfy their claims under a Dutch bankruptcy
as if there is no bankruptcy. As in suspension of payments proceedings the supervisory judge (rechtercommissaris) can order a
“cooling down period” for a maximum of two months (which can be extended once for another period of two months) during
which enforcement actions by secured creditors are barred unless such creditors have obtained leave for enforcement from the
supervisory judge. Furthermore, a bankruptcy receiver can force a secured creditor to foreclose its security interest within a
reasonable period of time (as determined by the bankruptcy receiver pursuant to Article 58(1) of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act),
failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the relevant rights or assets and distribute the proceeds to the secured party
after a deduction of liquidation costs (which may be significant). Excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the
bankruptcy estate; they may not be set-off against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor in the bankruptcy. To the extent
that Dutch law applies, a legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it
guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third
party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having a similar
effect) can be challenged in an insolvency proceeding or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its trustee in
bankruptcy. See below “—Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer.”

Under Dutch law, as soon as a debtor is declared bankrupt, in principle, all pending executions of judgments against
such debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor’s assets (other than with respect to secured creditors and certain other
creditors, as described above), will be terminated by operation of law. Simultaneously with the opening of the bankruptcy, a
bankruptcy receiver will be appointed. The proceeds resulting from the liquidation of the bankruptcy estate may not be
sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors under the guarantees granted by an insolvent guarantor after the secured and the
preferential creditors have been satisfied. In principle, litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically
stayed.

As in suspension of payments proceedings, in the bankruptcy of a company a composition may be offered to creditors,
which shall be binding on unsecured non-preferential creditors if it is (i) approved by a simple majority in number of the
creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged and
conditionally admitted, and (ii) subsequently confirmed by the court. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act does not in itself acknowledge
the concept of classes of creditors. Remaining proceeds, if any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors
are distributed among the unsecured non-preferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a pro rata basis. Contractual
subordination may to a certain extent be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. The actual effect depends largely on the
way such subordination is construed.

**_Temporary Legislation to Protect Enterprises in Financial Distress due to the COVID-19 Pandemic_**

The Dutch Parliament has recently adopted temporary legislation regarding a temporary suspension of enforcement
and other measures in support of enterprises during the COVID-19 pandemic (Tijdelijke wet COVID 19 SZW en JenV). The
temporary legislation provides for a court ordered moratorium and several related protections which apply until at least August
1, 2021 and can, if and when necessary, be extended beyond that date for two month periods at a time.

The measures of the legislation apply to enterprises (other than certain specific regulated entities) whose continuity is
threatened due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to a request from creditors (other than the Dutch Tax Authorities) to
declare the enterprise bankrupt or initiate the execution or seizure of assets, the enterprise/debtor can request the court to grant
a moratorium vis-à-vis those creditors of two months (which may be extended twice at the request of the enterprise/debtor by
two month periods at a time), and if such moratorium is granted by the court then during such period:

(i) the bankruptcy petition is stayed;

(ii) payment obligations to those creditors are suspended, and any prior default does not, in and of itself, provide
a legal basis to change the terms or suspend performance of, or terminate, an agreement with those creditors;
and


-----

(iii) if the court so decides, conservatory and executory attachments by those creditors are suspended, and no
other enforcement measures can (continue to) be taken by those creditors against the assets of their debtor
without the prior approval of the court.

The measures referred to in (iii) can also be requested in summary proceedings and attachments can be terminated as
part of such proceedings. It is important to note that any measure of the court only affects those creditors who requested the
bankruptcy or initiated the execution or seizure of assets of the debtor. However, any request by other creditors will most likely
result in the court taking the same decisions.

When considering the request to apply the measures discussed above, the court will need to establish that the
enterprise/debtor has made it plausible that, solely or mainly due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the enterprise
has not been able to continue its business as usual and as a result has temporarily become unable to pay its debts when they fall
due. The enterprise/debtor is in any event presumed to be in this position if it can provide financial information that shows that
prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic or the restrictive measures announced since March 15, 2020 (i) it had sufficient
liquidity to satisfy its due and payable debts, and (ii) its revenue decreased by at least 20% compared to the average revenue in
the preceding three months. The court will further need to conclude that following the moratorium the enterprise/debtor will
be able to satisfy its debts and that the creditor(s) that are affected are not significantly and unreasonably prejudiced as a result
of the moratorium. When granting a moratorium, the court can take any measures it considers necessary to ensure the interests
of the creditor(s) are not prejudiced.

**_Parallel Debt_**

Under Dutch law, it is uncertain whether security interests can be granted to a party other than the creditor of the claim
which is purported to be secured by such security interests. For that reason, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation
of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the "Parallel Debt") mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and
the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the Holders under or in connection with the Indenture, and a pledge under any
Dutch security document will be granted to the Security Agent to secure only the Parallel Debt. The parallel debt concept has
not been tested in Dutch courts, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability of a Dutch
security document posed by Dutch law. However, the mechanism of Parallel Debt is commonly accepted and applied in Dutch
market practice.

To the extent that the validity or enforceability of a Dutch security document is successfully challenged, Holders will
not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of a Dutch security document. In addition, the Holders
bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel
Debt.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

Under Dutch law, the validity and enforceability of the Notes, the Guarantees and the security interests over the
Collateral may, in whole or in part, also be affected or limited to the extent that the obligations of the Guarantors which are
incorporated under Dutch law (the "Dutch Guarantors") are not within the scope of their respective objects and the relevant
counterparty was aware or ought to have been aware (without inquiry) of this fact. The articles of association of each Dutch
Guarantor permit the provision of guarantee and security. However, the determination of whether a legal act (such as the
issuing of a note or the granting of a guarantee or security interest) is within the objects of a company may not be based solely
on the description of the articles of association of such company, but must take into account all relevant circumstances,
including, in particular, the question of whether the interests of such company are served by the relevant legal act. If the entering
into a legal act by a company, in light of the benefits, if any, derived by such company from entering into such legal act, would
have an adverse effect on the interest of the company, the legal act may be found to be voidable or the obligation resulting from
such legal act unenforceable upon the request of the relevant company or its administrator in bankruptcy. As a result, no
assurance can be given that a court would conclude that the issuance of a Note, the granting of the Guarantees or the granting
of the security interests over the Collateral is indeed within the corporate object and in the interest of such companies. To the
extent that a Dutch Guarantor or the administrator of a Dutch Guarantor successfully invokes the voidability or unenforceability
of a Note, a Guarantee or a security interest, such Note, Guarantee or security interest would be limited to the extent any portion
of it is not nullified and remains enforceable.

If Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security governed by Dutch law may be voided by a court, if the document was
executed through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or mistake (dwaling) of
a party to the agreement contained in that document. Whether or not a guarantor is insolvent in the Netherlands, pursuant to
Dutch law, payment under a guarantee or following enforcement of foreclosure of security granted may, regardless of an


-----

insolvency situation occurring or not, be withheld under the doctrines of reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en
_billijkheid), force majeure and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden). Other impeding factors include_
dissolution (ontbinding) of contract and set off (verrekening).

In addition, a guarantee issued by a Dutch Guarantor and security interest provided by the Issuer or Dutch Guarantor
may be suspended (schorsen) by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam (Ondernemingskamer van het
_Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) on the mention of a holder or holders of 10% or more of the shares in such company or shares or_
depositary receipts issued therefor with a nominal value of €225,000 or more or such lesser amount as provided in the
company’s articles of association. If the company has an issued share capital of at least €22.5 million, such motion may be
made by a holder or holders of 1% or more of the shares in such company or, provided those are listed on a qualifying trading
venue shares or depositary receipts issued therefor with a value of €20 million or more or such lesser amount as provided in
the company’s articles of association. A trade union, and other entities or persons entitled thereto in the articles of association
of, or an agreement with, the relevant Dutch company as well as the company itself may also submit a motion to the Enterprise
Chamber for this purpose. Likewise, the guarantee or security itself may be upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet actual
payment under it may be suspended or avoided.

The enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer or a Dutch Guarantor may also be limited under the 1977 Sanction
Act (Sanctiewet 1977) or otherwise by international sanctions and in proceedings in a Dutch court for the enforcement of a
Dutch law security interest, the court may mitigate amounts due in respect of litigation, enforcement and collection costs.

**_Enforcement of Security Interests_**

In the event of the occurrence of certain events, the Security Agent may enforce the security interests created pursuant
to the relevant security documents.

In general, mortgages and pledges rank above other rights of priority (other than senior ranking security and other
liens), including the general priority right of the Dutch tax authorities on the tax debtor’s assets. However, Dutch law provides
for exceptions. For example, under certain circumstances, the Dutch tax authorities’ priority right ranks above a non possessory
pledge on inventory (not including stock) found on the premises of the tax debtor (bodemzaken). Schemes often used to interfere
with these tax authorities’ priority, most notably the lease of the debtor’s premises (bodemverhuurconstructie), have been
restrained by recent legislation. Creditors intending to make use of this scheme, now must inform the tax authority of their
intention and may not carry out the scheme during a period of four weeks after the moment the tax authorities have been
informed.

Enforcement of security rights in a Dutch court is subject to Dutch rules of civil procedure. In addition, foreclosure
on security rights created under Dutch law (including allocation of the proceeds) is subject to Dutch law. Under Dutch law,
security rights are in principle enforced through a public auction of the relevant assets. This auction has to be effected in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Dutch Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek) and the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure
(Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering). Under Dutch law, shares in a Dutch private company with limited liability (besloten
_vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) may only be transferred upon foreclosure in accordance with Dutch law and the_
relevant pledged company’s articles of association as they read at the time of foreclosure. Undisclosed rights of pledge on
claims can, in principle, only be enforced (through collection of the claims) after the pledge has been disclosed to the debtor.

The Security Agent or (unless it has waived such right) the relevant security provider may request the competent court
to approve a private sale of the encumbered assets. In the event of pledged assets, the Security Agent and the relevant security
provider may agree to an alternative enforcement procedure once the pledge has become enforceable. The Security Agent may
also request the competent court to determine that the pledged assets shall accrue to it for a price determined by the court.

**_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_**

Dutch law contains specific provisions, known as “actio pauliana”, dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and
outside of bankruptcy. The actio pauliana provisions offer creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A
legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance
of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters
into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in
or outside bankruptcy of the relevant person and may be nullified by the bankruptcy receiver in a bankruptcy of the relevant
person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person outside bankruptcy, if: (i) the person performed such acts without a
prior existing legal obligation to do so (onverplicht); (ii) the creditor(s) concerned or, in the case of the person’s bankruptcy,
any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the act was performed


-----

the person and, unless the act was conducted for no consideration (om niet), the counterparty to the transaction knew or should
have known that one or more of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery. Also to the
extent that Dutch insolvency law applies, a guarantee or security interest may be nullified by the bankruptcy receiver on behalf
of and for the benefit of all creditors of the insolvent debtor, and in such case the beneficiary of the guarantee or security interest
is presumed (subject to evidence to the contrary) to have known that creditors of the debtor would be prejudiced if the
bankruptcy follows within a year of the granting and for no consideration.

The foregoing requirements for invoking fraudulent transfer outside of a bankruptcy apply mutatis mutandis when
invoking fraudulent transfer provisions during a bankruptcy.

In addition, the bankruptcy receiver may challenge the guarantee or security interest if it was granted on the basis of
a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) the guarantee or security interest was granted at a
time that the beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed or (ii) if such
guarantee or security interest was granted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the beneficiary of such guarantee
or security interest with a view to give preference to the beneficiary over the debtor’s other creditors. If a Dutch court found
that the issuance of the Notes or the granting of the Guarantees or security interest involved a fraudulent conveyance that did
not qualify for any defense under Dutch law, then the issuance of the Notes or the granting of the Guarantees or security rights
could be nullified. Consequently, the validity of the Notes, any guarantees or security interests granted by a Dutch legal entity
may be challenged and it is possible that such challenge would be successful. In addition, under such circumstances, holders
of the Notes might be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the Dutch Guarantors as a
result of the fraudulent conveyance.

**France**

Certain Guarantors are organized in France (the “French Guarantors”) and, consequently could be subject to French
insolvency proceedings affecting creditors, including court-assisted pre-insolvency proceedings (mandat ad hoc proceedings
or conciliation proceedings (procédure de conciliation)), and court-controlled pre-insolvency and insolvency proceedings
which would qualify as main insolvency proceedings under the EU Insolvency Regulation (to the extent that their respective
COMI or, in cases where the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply, their main center of interests within the meaning of
Article R. 600-1 of the French Commercial Code, is deemed to be in France in accordance with the EU Insolvency Regulation),
i.e., safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde), accelerated safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde
_accélérée), accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde financière accélérée) and judicial_
reorganization proceedings (redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire).

In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and protection of employment over the
payment of creditors and could limit the ability of holders of the Notes to enforce their rights under the Notes. The following
is a general discussion of insolvency proceedings governed by French law for informational purposes only and does not address
all the French legal considerations that may be relevant to holders of the Notes and/or the Guarantees granted by the French
Guarantors.

Specialized courts exist for (i) insolvency proceedings (and for conciliation as the case may be) with respect to debtors
that meet or exceed the following thresholds (on a stand-alone basis or together with companies under their control): (x) €20
million in turnover and 250 employees or (y) €40 million in turnover; (ii) (x) main insolvency proceedings commenced with
respect to a debtor which has an establishment located in another Member State within the meaning of the EU Insolvency
Regulation, (y) secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation and (z)
specific matters in the case where secondary insolvency proceedings would not have been commenced but main insolvency
proceedings have been commenced in another Member State; or (iii) insolvency proceedings, in cases where the EU Insolvency
Regulation does not apply, with respect to debtors having their centre of main interests (COMI) (centre principal des intérêts)
within the jurisdiction of such specialized courts.

Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation lists safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard,
judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings as insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU
Insolvency Regulation. Any company of the Group having its COMI in France would be subject to French main insolvency
proceedings and any company of our group having an establishment in France and its COMI in another EU Member State (other
than Denmark) could be subject to French secondary insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency
Regulation.

In addition, the French court that commences insolvency proceedings with respect to the member of a corporate group
has jurisdiction over all the other members of the group (subject to specific detention/control thresholds and French courts


-----

having international jurisdiction with respect to such entities, in accordance with the rules outlined above); accordingly, a court
can supervise the insolvency proceedings of the whole group and may, for this purpose, appoint the same administrator
(administrateur judiciaire) and creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) for all proceedings in respect of members of
the group.

The following is a general discussion of preventive and insolvency proceedings governed by French law for
informational purposes only and does not address all the French legal considerations that may be relevant to holders of the
Notes. Such proceedings will likely be amended in the context of the transposition of the EU Restructuring Directive into
French law with respect to which French law n° 2019-486 dated May 22, 2019 (“Loi Pacte”) grants the French government
twenty-four months to enact appropriate measures through ordinances for the transposition of the EU Restructuring Directive.

**_Temporary Measures in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic_**

Within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the French government implemented Ordinance n° 2020-341 of March
27, 2020, Ordinance n° 2020-596, Ordinance n° 2020-1443 and Law n°2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020, in force as from
December 8, 2020. Such Ordinances and law provide for specific provisions applicable for a limited period of time to preinsolvency and insolvency situation under French law.

In particular, until December 31, 2021, pursuant to Article 1 of Ordinance n°2020-1443 dated November 25, 2020, in
force as from November 26, 2020, at the request of the conciliator, the duration of conciliation proceedings may be extended
one or more times, by a reasoned decision of the president of the court, up to a maximum of ten months (see “—Conciliation
_Proceedings” below)._

In addition, Article 124 of Law n°2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020, in force as from December 8, 2020 extends
until December 31, 2021 the following measures that were initially adopted by Ordinance n°2020-596 dated May 20, 2020, in
force as from May 21, 2020 that were due to expire on December 31, 2020:

     - additional specific measures aimed at protecting debtors and an adaptation of the provisions governing grace
periods in the context of conciliation proceedings (see “—Conciliation Proceedings” and “—Grace Periods”
below);

     - the loosening of the conditions for eligibility to Accelerated Safeguard Proceedings and Accelerated Financial
Safeguard Proceedings (see “—Accelerated Safeguard and Accelerated Financial Safeguard Proceedings”
below);

     - the supervising judge’s right, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or the creditors’ representative,
to reduce from 30 to 15 days of receipt of the debt settlement proposal the deadline during which creditors can
respond to a debt settlement proposal in the context of a standard consultation for the approval of a safeguard or
reorganization plan;

     - the possible up to two year extension of the duration of the safeguard or reorganization plan, as a result of which
such a plan can now last up to 12 years; and

     - the grant of a special privilege for creditors that make new cash contributions to the debtor during the observation
period in order to ensure the continuation of the company’s business and its survival and for those who undertake
to make such contribution for the execution of the safeguard or reorganization plan ordered or modified by the
court (the “S/R Lien”).

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, these rules may be further adapted and additional measures may be put in place
within the following weeks or months, which may have an impact on French insolvency law.

**_Grace Periods_**

In addition to and independently from the specific provisions of insolvency laws discussed below, the holders of the
Notes as our creditors could also be subject to Articles 1343-5 et seq. of the French Civil Code (Code civil).

Pursuant to the provisions of this Article, French courts may, in any civil or commercial proceedings involving the
debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor taking into account the debtor’s financial position and the creditor’s


-----

needs, defer or otherwise reschedule over a maximum period of two years the payment dates of payment obligations and decide
that any amounts, the payment date of which is thus deferred or rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate that is lower than the
contractual rate (but not lower than the prevailing legal rate as published twice a year by administrative decree of the Ministry
of Economy) or that payments made shall first be allocated to repayment of principal. A court order made under Article 13435 of the French Civil Code will suspend any pending enforcement measures, and any contractual default interest or penalty for
late payment will not accrue or be due during the grace periods ordered by the relevant court. A creditor cannot contract out of
such grace periods. If the debtor is engaged in conciliation proceedings or has reached a conciliation agreement that is in the
course of being executed, special rules apply to the grant of grace periods (see “Court-assisted Pre- insolvency Proceedings”
below).

When the debtor benefits from the opening of a conciliation proceeding, these provisions shall be read in combination
with Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code (see below).

Additionally, pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, the judge having commenced
conciliation proceedings may, during the execution period of a conciliation agreement, impose grace periods on creditors having
participated in the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) for their claims that were
not dealt with in the conciliation agreement.

**_Insolvency (Cessation des Paiements) Under French Law_**

Under French law, a company is deemed in a state of cessation des paiements when it is not able to pay its debts
which are due and payable (which do not include debts in respect of which the relevant creditors have granted a moratorium)
with its available assets taking into account credit lines available to it.

The date of insolvency (cessation des paiements) is generally deemed to be the date of the court order commencing
judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may be up to 18 months before
the date of the court order. Except for fraud, the date of insolvency may not be fixed at an earlier date than the date of the final
court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings. The date of insolvency
marks the beginning of the hardening period (période suspecte) (see below).

**_Court-assisted Pre-insolvency Proceedings_**

Pre-insolvency proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor company itself, in its sole discretion; provided that it
experiences or anticipates legal, economic or financial difficulties:

(i) while not being in a state of cessation des paiements in case of mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings,
or
(ii) while not being in a state of cessation des paiements for more than 45 days in case of conciliation proceedings
only.

_Mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings are informal and confidential (subject to the details below as regards_
_conciliation proceedings) proceedings carried out under the supervision of the president of the court. The President of the_
competent court will appoint an intermediary (as the case may be, a mandataire ad hoc or a conciliator) in order to help the
debtor company reach an agreement with its main creditors and stakeholders, in particular by reducing or rescheduling its
indebtedness. The debtor may propose, in the filing for the commencement of the proceedings, the appointment of a particular
person as intermediary. Such proceedings are non-binding since the court-appointed intermediary has no power to force the
parties to accept an agreement and the dissenting creditors will not be bound by the arrangement, if any. Creditors are not
barred from taking legal action against the company to recover their claims, but, in practice, they generally abstain from doing
so, to try and negotiate a consensual restructuring. Should creditors decide to take legal action, the seized court can, at any time,
grant the debtor a grace period that can last up to 24 months.

_Mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings may also be used at the request of the debtor and after the opinion of the_
participating creditors has been sought to prepare the sale of all or part of the business of the debtor with a view to implement
such asset sale plan (plan de cession) in subsequent court-administered proceedings. Provided that they comply with certain
requirements, any offers received in this context by the mandataire ad hoc or the conciliator may be directly considered by
the court in the context of safeguard, reorganization or liquidation proceedings after consultation of the public prosecutor.


-----

Contractual provisions modifying the terms of an outstanding contract, by diminishing the rights or increasing the
obligations of the debtor solely by reason of the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or the opening of conciliation proceedings,
or any request made to this end are deemed null and void.

Equally, contractual provisions that would, as the sole result of the opening of a mandat ad hoc proceeding or the
opening of conciliation proceedings, make the debtor bear the fees of the creditor’s counsel relating to such proceedings for
the portion that would exceed three quarters of the total fee of the relevant counsel are null and void.

**_Mandat Ad Hoc Proceedings_**

French law does not provide for any detailed rules in respect of mandat ad hoc proceedings. In practice, mandat ad
_hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing difficulties of an economic or financial nature but are not insolvent (“en_
_état de cessation des paiements”). There is no time limit for the duration of mandat ad hoc proceedings. The agreement reached_
by the parties (if any) with the help of the court-appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc, whose name can be suggested by the
debtor and whose duties are determined by the court appointing him, usually to facilitate negotiations with the creditors) can
be reported to the President of the court but, unlike in conciliation proceedings, French law does not provide for any approval
by the Court or recognition by the President of the court with the related specific consequences. This restructuring agreement
between the company and its main creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis; those creditors not
willing to take part cannot be bound by the arrangement. The mandataire ad hoc is appointed in order to facilitate negotiations
with creditors but cannot coerce the latter into accepting any proposal. Such proceedings are confidential (save for their
disclosure for statutory auditors, if any).

In any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the court for a grace period as set forth in Articles 1343-5 et seq.
of the French Civil Code.

**_Conciliation Proceedings_**

Conciliation proceedings are available to French debtors that face current or foreseeable difficulties of a legal,
economic or financial nature but which have not been cash-flow insolvent for more than 45 days. The debtor petitions the
President of the relevant court for the appointment of a “conciliator” (whose name the debtor can suggest) in charge of assisting
the debtor in negotiating with all or part of its creditors and/or trade partners an agreement, that puts an end to its difficulties,
providing e.g. for the restructuring of its indebtedness. Conciliation proceedings may last up to four months (with the conciliator
being able to request an extension up to five months). Ordinance n°2020-1443 provides that, for proceedings initiated up to
and including December 31, 2021, the maximum duration of conciliation proceedings may be extended at the request of the
conciliator, once or several times, for up to ten months. Such proceedings are confidential (save for their disclosure for statutory
auditors, if any). During the proceedings, (i) no general stay is imposed on creditors which may continue to sue individually
for payment of their claims but they usually in practice restrain themselves from doing so, in order to negotiate a consensual
restructuring and (ii) creditors may not request the opening of insolvency proceedings (redressement judiciaire or liquidation
_judiciaire) against the debtor._

In addition, if a creditor seeks payment (subject to the COVID-19 related provisions described below), pursuant to
Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, the judge having opened the conciliation proceedings has jurisdiction to grant
a grace period to the debtor, in accordance with Article 1343-5 et seq. of the French Civil Code, provided that the debtor has
received a formal notice requesting payment or faces enforcement measures, in which case the decision would be taken after
having heard the conciliator and the judge may limit the duration of the measures it orders to the conclusion of an agreement
in the framework of conciliation proceedings.

Due to the COVID-19 epidemic and state of health emergency that was imposed by the French government, Ordinance
n° 2020-341 of March 27, 2020, Ordinance n° 2020-596 of May 20, 2020 and Ordinance n° 2020-1443 of November 25, 2020
and Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020 have modified conciliation proceedings to provide that, until December 31,
2021:

1. the duration of conciliation proceedings can be extended upon request of the conciliator, thereby increasing
the maximum duration of conciliation proceedings to 10 months (instead of 5 months previously);

2. if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by the conciliator to defer
payment of his claim for the duration of the conciliation proceedings, the debtor may request from the
President of the Commercial Court in ex-parte proceedings, for the duration of the conciliation proceedings:


-----

         - the stay or prohibition of any legal action for payment or for termination of a contract for a payment
default;

         - the stay or prohibition of any judicial enforcement measure against the debtor’s movable or immovable
property as well as any judicial procedure relating to the distribution of the debtor’s assets that would
not have already transferred ownership away from the debtor; or

         - the deferral or rescheduling of the creditor’s claim;

3. the debtor may petition the judge that commenced conciliation proceedings for a grace period in accordance
with Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “Grace Periods” above) even before the creditor sends any
notice to pay or initiates any suit for payment if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the
conciliator, a request made by the conciliator to suspend payment of his claim for the duration of the
conciliation.

Additionally, pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, the judge having commenced
conciliation proceedings may, during the execution period of a conciliation agreement (whether it is acknowledged or approved
as described below), impose grace periods on creditors who were asked to participate in the conciliation proceedings (other than
the tax and social security administrations) and have formally put the debtor on notice to pay or are suing for payment of claims
that were not dealt with in the conciliation agreement, such decision being taken after hearing the conciliator if he/she has been
appointed to monitor the implementation of the agreement.

The conciliation agreement reached between the parties may be acknowledged (constaté) by the president of the
Commercial Court at the request of the parties, which makes the agreement binding upon them (in particular, performance of
the conciliation agreement prevents any action by the creditors party thereto against the debtor to obtain payment of claims
governed by the conciliation agreement) and enforceable without further recourse to a judge (force exécutoire), but the
conciliation proceedings remain confidential.

Alternatively, the conciliation agreement may be approved (homologué) by the Commercial Court at the request of
the debtor following a hearing held for that purpose which will have to be attended by the works council or employee
representatives, as the case may be, if (i) the debtor is not insolvent or the conciliation agreement has the effect of putting an
end to the debtor’s insolvency, (ii) the conciliation agreement effectively ensures that the company will survive as a going
concern and (iii) the conciliation agreement does not impair the rights of the non-signatory creditors. Such approval will have
the same effect as its acknowledgement (constatation) as described above, except that in addition:

    - the decision of approval by the relevant court which should only disclose the amount of any New Money Lien
(see below) and the guarantees and security interests granted to secure the same, will be public but the agreement
itself should otherwise remain confidential except vis-à-vis the work council or employees representatives that
are informed of the content of the conciliation agreement and may have access to the full conciliation agreement
at the clerk’s office (greffe) of the Court;

     - creditors who, as part of the approved agreement or during the course of the conciliation proceedings, provide
new money or goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the distressed company
(other than shareholders providing new equity) will benefit from a specific protection (the so-called “New Money
**Lien”) and as such enjoy priority of payment over all pre-petition and post-petition claims (other than certain pre-**
petition employment claims and post-petition procedural costs), in the event of subsequent insolvency
proceedings;

    - in the event of subsequent safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard, judicial
reorganization proceedings, the payment date of claims benefiting from the New Money Lien may not be
rescheduled nor written-off without their holders’ consent, not even in the framework of the creditors’ committees
or of the bondholders’ general meeting (although a doubt may arise as to the application of such provision within
the bondholders’ general meeting);

     - when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is communicated to its statutory
auditors; and


-----

     - in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the date of the
_cessation des paiements (and therefore the starting date of the “hardening period” as defined below) cannot be_
determined by the court to be at a date earlier than the date of the approval of the agreement by the court, except
in case of fraud.

Whether the conciliation agreement is acknowledged or approved, the court may, at the request of the debtor, appoint
the conciliator to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à l’exécution de l’accord) during its execution,
and while the agreement is in force.

     - interest accruing on the claims that are the subject to the conciliation agreement may not be compounded;

     - the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced the conciliation proceedings for a grace period
in accordance with Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code as explained above; and

     - a joint-debtor and a third party that had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or security interest) with
respect to the debtor’s obligations may benefit from the provisions of the conciliation agreement as well as from
grace periods granted to the debtor in the context of conciliation proceedings.

If the debtor breaches the agreement, whether approved or acknowledged, any party thereto can petition the court for
its rescission. If such rescission is granted, grace periods granted in relation to the conciliation proceedings may be revoked.
Conversely, provided that the conciliation agreement’s terms are complied with, any individual proceeding by any creditor for
the payment of claims covered by the conciliation agreement are suspended and/or prohibited. The commencement of
subsequent insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will
recover their claims (decreased by the payments already received) and pre-existing security interests or guarantees.

At the request of the debtor and after the creditors taking part in the conciliation proceedings have been consulted on
the matter, mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings may also be used to organize the partial or total sale of the debtor, in
particular through a “plan for the disposal of the business” (plan de cession) which could be implemented in the context of
subsequent safeguard, judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings. Provided that they comply with certain requirements,
any offers received in this context by the mandataire ad hoc or the conciliator may be directly considered by the court in the
context of safeguard, judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings after consultation of the State prosecutor.

As a matter of law, any contractual provision that (i) modifies the conditions for the continuation of an ongoing contract
by reducing the debtors’ rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of the designation of a mandataire ad hoc or of
the commencement of conciliation proceedings or of a request submitted to this end or requires the debtor to bear, by reason
only of the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings, more than three-quarters
of the fees of the professional advisers retained by creditors in connection with these proceedings, is deemed null and void.

Where the maximum time period allotted to court-assisted proceedings expires without an agreement being reached,
the proceedings will end. The termination of such proceedings does not, in and of itself entail any specific legal consequences
for the debtor, in particular it does not result in the automatic commencement of insolvency proceedings. New conciliation
proceedings cannot be commenced before three months have elapsed as from the end of the previous ones.

**_Court-controlled Insolvency Proceedings_**

The following French insolvency proceedings may be initiated by or against a company in France:

(a) safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde), accelerated safeguard proceedings (procédure de
_sauvegarde accélérée) or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde_
_financière accélérée), upon petition by the debtor only if, while not being in a state of cessation des paiements_
(or for accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, if in cessation
_des paiements for less than 45 days when it initially requested the opening of conciliation proceedings),_
it is facing difficulties which it cannot overcome. Absent any difficulties it cannot overcome, the court will
invite the debtor to file for conciliation proceedings. It will then rule on the safeguard petition only. The
conditions for the opening of accelerated safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) or
accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde financière accélérée) are described
below.


-----

(b) judicial reorganization proceedings (redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation proceedings
(liquidation judiciaire) upon petition by the debtor, any creditor or the public prosecutor if such company is
in cessation des paiements. Judicial reorganization proceedings are available to companies whose recovery
prospects are possible while judicial liquidation proceedings are available to companies whose recovery is
manifestly impossible.

(c) Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court, after
having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may
order the commencement of the proceedings which it determines to be most appropriate. The same would
apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considered
that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate.

As soon as safeguard, judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings are initiated, any unpaid amount of share
capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable.

While a company may file for safeguard proceedings at any time it is facing insurmountable difficulties, it is
required to petition for the opening of judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings within 45 days of
becoming in a state of _cessation des paiements. Alternatively, the debtor may request the opening of conciliation_
proceedings within the same timeframe. If it does not, directors and, as the case may be, de facto managers of the
company, may be subject to civil liability.

**_Court-administered Proceedings—Safeguard_**

A debtor which experiences difficulties that is not able to overcome may, in its sole discretion, initiate safeguard
proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) with respect to itself, provided that it is not insolvent (see “The Insolvency Test”).
Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, nor invited to attend the hearing before the court at which the commencement of
safeguard proceedings is requested. Following the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed administrator
(administrateur judiciaire) is appointed (except for small companies where the court considers that such appointment is not
necessary) to investigate the business of the debtor during an “observation period” (being the period starting on the date of the
court decision commencing the proceedings and ending on the date on which the court takes a decision on the outcome of the
proceedings), which may last up to 18 months. The role of the court-appointed administrator is also to assist the debtor in
preparing a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it will circulate among its creditors. Creditors do not have
effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor assisted by the court-appointed administrator.
The court-appointed administrator will, in accordance with the terms of the judgment appointing him or her, exercise ex post
facto control over decisions made by the debtor (mission de surveillance) or assist the debtor to make all or some of the
management decisions (mission d’assistance), all under the supervision of the court.

If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation des
_paiements) before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public_
prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial
reorganization proceedings.

In addition, the court may convert such safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings (i) after
commencement of the proceedings, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public
prosecutor, if it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) before commencement of the proceedings,
(ii) at any time during the observation period upon its own initiative or upon request of the debtor, the judicial administrator, the
creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor in the case where the debtor is insolvent, or (iii) upon request of the debtor, the
administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor in case no plan has been adopted by the relevant creditors’
committee and, if any, the bondholders’ assembly (as described below), if the approval of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible
and if the company would shortly become insolvent should safeguard proceedings end. At any time during the observation period,
the court may also convert such proceedings into liquidation proceedings if the debtor is insolvent and its recovery is manifestly
impossible.

In all such cases, the court may decide at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’
representative or the public prosecutor and in all such cases with the exception of (i) above, the court may act upon its own initiative;
and the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative,
the public prosecutor, the controllers and the workers’ representatives (if any).


-----

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the state of health emergency that was imposed by the French government, Ordinance
n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 and Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020 modified safeguard proceedings to provide that:

     - As an incentive for new financings granted to debtors in the context of safeguard or reorganization proceedings,
a new safeguard or reorganization privilege is created (the “S/R Lien”), applicable exclusively to proceedings
commenced between May 22, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The S/R Lien is distinct from the existing statutory
preference enjoyed by financing granted with the approval of the bankruptcy judge, after commencement of the
proceedings for the needs of the proceedings or of the observation period.

     - The S/R Lien applies to all new cash contributions made, with the exception of those made through a share capital
increase, by any person:

(a) during the observation period, in order to ensure the continuity of debtor’s business and its sustainability, in
which case such cash contributions must be authorized by the bankruptcy judge, or

(b) for the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan, i.e. within the plan as approved or modified
by the court, and for the purposes of its execution, it being specified that the judgment must mention all claims
benefiting from the privilege, as well as the relevant amounts.

    - Claims benefiting from the S/R Lien enjoy a priority of payment over pre-commencement and postcommencement claims except with respect to employees’ super-privilege claims, procedural costs and the New
Money Lien in the event of on-going or subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings
or judicial liquidation proceedings.

     - Such claims may not be termed-out or written-off without the consent of the relevant creditors.

During the safeguard proceedings, payment by the debtor of any debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the
proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the
observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor, is prohibited, subject to very limited
exceptions. For example, the court can authorize payments for prior debts in order to discharge a lien on property needed for
the continued operation of the debtor’s business or to recover goods or rights transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate
(patrimoine fiduciaire).

Creditors must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the safeguard plan
(debt write-offs, payment terms or debt-for-equity swaps) prior to the plan being approved by the court. The rules governing
consultation will vary depending on the size of the business.

Standard consultation: this applies to debtors whose accounts are not certified by a statutory auditor or prepared by a
chartered accountant, or, if they are, who have 150 employees or less or a turnover of €20 million or less, unless upon their or
the administrator’s request and with the consent of the court, they are subject to the committee-based consultation (see below).

In such case, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the court- appointed creditors’
representative, who seeks the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the debt write-offs and payment schedules
proposed. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively.

French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the creditor and whether the
principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at this consultation stage. According to legal commentaries and established
practice, differing treatment as between creditors is possible, provided that it is justified by the difference in the situation of the
creditors and approved by the court-appointed creditors’ representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage
to make a proposal for a partial payment of claims over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of such claims over the
length of the plan (ten years maximum except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years).

Pursuant to Article 5 of Ordinance No. 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 adopted in the context of the COVID-19
pandemic, in force from May 21, 2021 and Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020 until December 31, 2021, the maximum
length of a plan can be extended to 12 years, or 17 years for agricultural businesses.

Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the plan is
approved are not required to be consulted.


-----

Creditors who do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal (other than debt-forequity-swap) made to them are deemed to have accepted it. The creditors’ representative keeps a list of the responses from
creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the court-appointed administrator and the controllers.

Pursuant to Article 4 of Ordinance No. 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 adopted in the context of the COVID-19
pandemic, in force from May 21, 2021 and Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020, until December 31, 2021, the
abovementioned 30-day delay may be reduced to 15 days, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or the courtappointed creditors’ representative.

Within the framework of a standard consultation, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de sauvegarde) can
impose a uniform rescheduling of the claims of creditors having refused the proposals that were submitted to them (subject to
specific regimes such as the one applicable to claims benefiting from the New Money Lien or the S/R Lien) over a maximum
period of ten years (except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years and for claims with maturity dates
of more than the deferral period set by the court, in which case the maturity date shall remain the same), but no write-off of any
claim or debt-for-equity swap may be imposed without the relevant creditor’s individual acceptance.

Following a court-imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting the
plan or on the first payment date following the initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the first payment date provided for
by the plan, in which case the amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had he or she
been paid in accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other creditors. In the third and subsequent
years, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 5% of the amount of each debt claim (except for agricultural
businesses).

Committee-based consultation: this applies to large companies, the accounts of which are certified by a statutory
auditor (commissaire aux comptes) or established by a chartered accountant (expert-comptable) and with more than 150
employees or a turnover greater than €20 million, or upon the debtor’s or the administrator’s request and with the consent of the
court in the case of debtors that do not exceed the aforementioned thresholds.

The consultation involves the submission of a proposed safeguard plan for consideration by two creditors’ committees
which are established by the court-appointed administrator on the basis of the claims that arose prior to the judgment
commencing the proceedings:

     - one for credit institutions or assimilated institutions and entities having granted credit or advances (including
shareholder advances) in favor of the debtor (or their successors) (the “credit institutions committee”); and

     - the other one for suppliers having a claim that represents more than 3% of the total amount of the claims of all
the debtor’s suppliers and other suppliers invited to participate in such committee by the court-appointed
administrator (the “main suppliers committee”).

If there are any outstanding debt securities in the form of obligations (such as bonds or notes and including capital
market debt instruments such as the Notes), a single general meeting of all holders of such debt securities will be established
(the “bondholders’ general meeting”), in which all such holders are to take part irrespective of whether or not there are
different issuances or of the governing law(s) of those obligations.

As a general matter, only the legal owner of the debt claim will be invited onto the committee or general meeting.
Accordingly, a person holding only an economic interest therein will not itself be a member of the committee or general
meeting.

The proposed plan:

     - must “take into account” subordination agreements entered into by the creditors before the commencement of the
proceedings;

     - may treat creditors differently if it is justified by their differences in situation; and

     - may, inter alia, include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts (subject to the specific regime of claims benefiting
from the New Money Lien or the S/R Lien), and/or debt-for-equity swaps (debt-for-equity swaps requiring the
relevant shareholder consent).


-----

If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may subscribe to such share capital increase by way
of a set-off against their claims against the debtor (as reduced according to the provisions of the plan, where applicable).

Creditors that are members of the credit institutions committee or of the major suppliers committee may also prepare
alternative safeguard plans in accordance with the above principles that will also be put to the vote of the committees and of the
bondholders’ general meeting, it being specified that approval of any such alternative plan is subject to the same two-thirds majority
vote in each committee and in the bondholders’ general meeting and gives rise to a report by the court-appointed administrator
(administrateur judiciaire). Bondholders are not permitted to present their own alternative plan.

The committees must approve or reject the safeguard plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission. The period may be
extended or shortened but may never be shorter than 15 days. The plan must be approved by a majority vote of each committee
(two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the creditors casting a vote).

Each member of a creditors’ committee or of the bondholders’ general meeting must, if applicable, inform the courtappointed administrator of the existence of any agreement relating to (i) the exercise of its vote or (ii) the full or partial payment
of its claim by a third party as well as of any subordination agreement. The court-appointed administrator shall then submit to
such person a proposal for the computation of its voting rights in the creditors’ committees/ bondholders’ general meeting. In
the event of disagreement, the matter may be ruled upon by the President of the Commercial Court in summary proceedings at
the request of the creditor or of the court-appointed administrator.

The amounts of claims secured by a trust (fiducie) granted by the debtor do not give rise to voting rights. In addition,
creditors whose repayment schedule is not modified by the plan, or for which the plan provides for a payment of their claims
in cash in full as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their claims are admitted, do not need to be consulted on the plan nor
take part in the vote.

Following the approval of the plan by the two creditors’ committees, the plan will be submitted for approval to the
bondholders’ general meeting at the same two-thirds majority vote. Following approval by the creditors’ committees and the
bondholders’ general meeting, and determination of the rescheduling of the claims of creditors that are not members of the
committees or bondholders in accordance with the standard consultation process referred to above, the plan has to be approved
(arrêté) by the court. The court must verify that the interests of all creditors are “sufficiently protected” and that required
shareholder consent (if applicable) has been obtained. Once so approved by the relevant court, the safeguard plan will be
binding on all the members of the committees and all bondholders (including those who did not vote or voted against the
adoption of the plan).

If the debtor’s proposed plan is not approved by both committees and the bondholders’ general meeting within the
first six months of the observation period (either because they do not vote on the plan or because they reject it), this six-month
period may be extended by the court at the request of the court-appointed administrator for a period not exceeding the duration
of the observation period, in order for the plan to be approved through the committee-based consultation process. Absent such
extension, the court can still adopt a safeguard plan within the time remaining until the end of the observation period. In such
a case, the rules are the same as the ones applicable for the standard consultation process described above.

If the draft plan provides for a modification of the share capital or the by-laws, the court may decide that the
shareholders general meeting and, as the case may be, the general meetings of the holders of securities giving access to the
share capital of the company shall vote, the first time the relevant meeting is convened, at a simple majority of the votes of the
shareholders attending, or represented at, the meeting, provided that they hold at least half of the shares with voting rights. The
second time the meeting is convened, the usual provisions relating to quorum and majority shall apply.

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the
continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.

If no proposed safeguard plan whatsoever is adopted by the committees and, if applicable, the bondholders’ general
meeting, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the mandataire judiciaire or the public prosecutor, the
court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings if it appears that the adoption of a
safeguard plan is impossible and if the end of the safeguard proceedings would certainly lead to the debtor shortly becoming
insolvent.

_Specific case—Creditors that are public institutions: public creditors (financial administrations, social security and_
unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt write-offs under conditions that are similar to those that would
be granted under normal market conditions by a private economic operator placed in a similar position.


-----

Public creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or relinquish these
security interests. Public creditors examine possible debt write-offs within the framework of a local administrative committee
(Commission des Chefs de Services Financiers). The tax administrations may grant relief from all direct taxes. As regards
indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines.

**_Accelerated Safeguard and Accelerated Financial Safeguard Proceedings_**

A debtor that is engaged in conciliation proceedings may request the commencement of accelerated safeguard
proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde
_financière accélérée)._

The accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings have been designed to “fasttrack” difficulties faced by large companies, i.e., those:

     - which publish consolidated accounts in accordance with Article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code; or

     - whose publish accounts are certified by a statutory auditor or established by a certified public accountant and who
have (i) more than 20 employees, (ii) a turnover greater than €3.0 million (excluding VAT) or (iii) whose total
balance sheet exceeds €1.5 million.

However, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 and Law n°2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020 provide that
these thresholds will no longer be required for proceedings commenced between May 22, 2020 and December 31, 2021.

If the debtor does not meet the conditions that require creditors’ committees (see above) to be constituted, the court
shall authorize such constitution in the opening decision.

To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the debtor must
fulfil the following conditions:

     - the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applies for commencement of
conciliation proceedings;

     - the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the commencement of the
proceedings;

     - as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties which it is not in a position to
overcome; and

     - the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business as a going concern
which is supported by enough of its creditors involved in the proceedings to render likely its adoption by the
relevant committees (credit institutions’ committee only for financial accelerated safeguard proceedings) and
bondholders general meeting, if any, within a maximum of three months following the commencement of
accelerated safeguard proceedings, or within a month following the commencement of accelerated financial
safeguard proceedings (that can be extended by an additional month).

While accelerated safeguard proceedings apply to all creditors (except employees), accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings apply only to “financial creditors” (i.e., creditors that belong to the credit institutions committee and bondholders’
general meeting), the payment of whose debt is suspended until the adoption of a plan through accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings. The debtor will be prohibited from paying to any creditor to whom the accelerated safeguard or accelerated
financial safeguard proceedings (as the case may be) apply, any amounts (including interest) relating to debts incurred (i)
prior to the commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the
purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor
(post commencement non-privileged debts). Such amounts may be paid only after the judgment of the court approving the
safeguard plan and in accordance with its terms. Creditors other than financial creditors (such as public creditors, the tax or
social security administration and suppliers) are not directly impacted by accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. Their
debts will continue to be due and payable in the ordinary course of business according to their contractual or legal terms.


-----

The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings is broadly applicable to accelerated safeguard or
accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (for example, creditors will be consulted by way of a committee-based consultation
on, as the case may be, a draft accelerated safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde accélérée) or a draft accelerated
financial safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde financière accélérée) and creditors that are members of the credit
institutions committee or the major suppliers committee, but not bondholders, may also prepare alternative draft plans as
described above), to the extent compatible with the accelerated timing, since the maximum duration of accelerated safeguard
proceedings is three months and the maximum duration of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is two months (provided
the court has decided to extend the initial one month period). However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and to
the recovery of assets by their owners do not apply in accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings.

In particular, the creditors’ committees and the bondholders’ general meeting are required to vote on the proposed
safeguard plan within a minimum period of 15 days of its being notified to them in the case of accelerated safeguard
proceedings, or within eight days in the case of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings.

The plan in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is adopted
following the same majority rules as in standard safeguard proceedings and may notably provide for rescheduling, debt
cancellation and conversion of debt into equity capital of the debtor (debt-for-equity swaps requiring relevant shareholder
consent). No debt rescheduling or cancellation may be imposed, without their consent, on creditors that do not belong to one of
the committees or are not bondholders.

If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the court shall
terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors outside of the committee process.
Ordinance n°2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 and Law n°2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020 provides that for proceedings
commenced between May 22, 2020 and December 31, 2021, if a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court
within the applicable deadline the debtor, the judicial administrator, the creditors representative or the public prosecutor may
request, without any delay, that reorganization or liquidation proceedings (as the case may be) be opened. If a plan is not
adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the court shall terminate the proceedings.
The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors outside of the committee process.

The list of claims of creditors party to the conciliation proceedings certified by the statutory auditor shall be deemed
to constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of accelerated safeguard proceedings or, as applicable, accelerated
financial safeguard proceedings (see below) unless the creditors otherwise elect to make such a filing (see below).

**_Judicial Reorganization or Liquidation Proceedings_**

Judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or liquidation (liquidation judiciaire) proceedings may be
initiated against or by a debtor only if it is insolvent and, in the case of liquidation proceedings only, if the debtor’s recovery is
manifestly impossible. The debtor is required to petition for judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings (or for
conciliation proceedings, as discussed above) within 45 days of becoming insolvent; de jure managers (including directors)
and, as the case may be, de facto managers that would have failed to file such a petition within the deadline are exposed to civil
liability.

Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court, after having
heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may order the commencement
of the proceedings that it determines to be most appropriate. The same would apply if the debtor requested the commencement
of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considered that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate.
In addition, at any time during the safeguard proceedings observation period, upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed
administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the public prosecutor, the court may convert safeguard
proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings or liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor was already
insolvent at the time of the court decision opening the proceedings. In all cases, the court’s decision is only taken after having
heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the public prosecutor and the workers’
representatives (if any).

The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the preservation of
employment and the payment of creditors, in that order.

As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share
capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable.


-----

In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings, an administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually
appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up to 18 months,
and make proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor (by helping the debtor to elaborate a draft judicial reorganization
plan, which is similar to a draft safeguard plan), or the sale of the business or the liquidation of the debtor. The court- appointed
administrator will assist the debtor in making management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court
to take over the management and control of the debtor (mission d’administration). Judicial reorganization proceedings
broadly take place in a manner that is similar to safeguard proceedings (see above), subject to certain specificities.

In particular, the rules relating to creditor consultation, especially the powers of the court adopting the judicial
reorganization plan (plan de redressement) in the event of rejection by the creditors of proposals made to them, are the same
(see above). At any time during the observation period, the court can, at the request of the debtor, the court- appointed
administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the public prosecutor or at its own initiative, order the
partial cessation of the business (cessation partielle de l’activité) or order the liquidation of the debtor if its recovery is
manifestly impossible. At the end of the observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court.

In addition, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 modified the judicial reorganization proceedings to provide
for the new S/R Lien (as defined and detailed above see “—France—Court-administered Proceedings—Safeguard”). In
judicial reorganization proceedings, in case a shareholders’ meeting needs to vote to bring the shareholders’ equity (capitaux
_propres) to a level equal to at least one half of the share capital (capital social) as required by Article L. 626-3 of the French_
Commercial Code, the administrator may appoint a trustee (mandataire de justice) to convene a shareholders’ meeting and to
vote on behalf of the shareholders that refuse to vote in favor of such a resolution if the draft restructuring plan provides for a
modification of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the reorganization plan.

If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly not likely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no
reorganization plan is proposed, the court, upon the request of the court-appointed administrator, can order the total or partial
transfer of the business in accordance with the process for a sale of the business described below.

In judicial reorganization proceedings if (i) the company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within the
meaning of the French Labor Code) one or more companies having together at least 150 employees, (ii) the disappearance of
the company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy and to local employment and (iii) the
modification of the company’s share capital seems to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or regional economy
and to allow the continued operation of the business as a going concern, then, at the request of the court-appointed administrator
or of the State prosecutor (x) after the review of the options for a total or partial sale of the business and (y) if at least three
months have elapsed as from the court decision commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders’ meetings required
to approve the modification of the company’s share capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan have refused such
modification, the insolvency court may either:

     - appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders’ meeting and vote the share capital
increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount provided for in the
reorganization plan; or

     - order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan, the sale of all or part
of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital modification and holding, directly
or indirectly, a portion of the share capital providing them with a majority of the voting rights (including as a
result of an agreement with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in the company’s shareholders’ meetings;
any consent clause being deemed unwritten, the other shareholders have the right to withdraw from the company
and request that their shares be purchased simultaneously by the transferees.

In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the parties, be set
by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings.

In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new shareholders to hold
their shares for a certain time period set by the court which may not exceed the duration of the reorganization plan.

If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which is generally
the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in judicial liquidation proceedings
nor does the law limit their duration (except with respect to simplified judicial liquidation proceedings). The liquidator is vested
with the power to represent the debtor and perform the liquidation operations (mainly to liquidate the assets and settle the


-----

liabilities to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority order of
payment). The liquidator will take over the management and control of the debtor and the managers of the debtor are no longer
in charge of its management.

Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes:

     - a sale of business (cession d’entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire)
will usually be appointed to manage the debtor during a temporary period of continuation of the business
operations ordered by the court (three months, renewable once) and organize such sale of the business as a going
concern via an asset sale, i.e. an asset sale plan (plan de cession), any third party (as construed under French law)
being entitled to present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business); or

     - a sale of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to:

        - launch auction sales (vente aux enchères (or adjudication amiable for real estate assets only));

        - sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers have
been received (the formal authorization of the bankruptcy judge being necessary to conclude the sale
agreement with the bidder); or

        - in practice, request, under the supervision of the bankruptcy judge, all potential interested purchasers to
bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process whereby the bidders
submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed before such hearing
(procédure des plis cachetés). However, the possibility to implement such process is questioned by
certain legal authors and case law in this respect has varied.

If the court adopts a reorganization or sale plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be
essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.

The court will end the proceedings when either no due liabilities remain and the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay
off the creditors (extinction du passif) or continuation of the liquidation process becomes impossible due to an insufficiency of
assets (insuffisance d’actif).

The court may also terminate the proceedings:

     - when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the difficulty of
selling the assets; or

     - in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors, by appointing a mandataire in charge of
continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from these lawsuits between the remaining
creditors.

**_The Observation Period and Its Outcome_**

The period from the date of the court decision commencing the insolvency proceedings and until the court makes a
decision on the outcome of the proceedings is called the observation period (période d’observation) and may last up to twelve
months (with six additional months under exceptional circumstances and upon request of the public prosecutor) under safeguard
or judicial reorganization proceedings. During the observation period, the court-appointed administrator investigates the
business of the company.

Under safeguard proceedings, the court-appointed administrator’s mission is limited to either supervising the debtor’s
management or assisting it, and in any case helping it prepare a safeguard plan for the company. In judicial reorganization
proceedings, the court-appointed administrator’s mission is usually to assist the management and to make proposals for the
reorganization of the company, which proposals may include a reorganization or an asset sale plan. In judicial reorganization
proceedings, the court may also decide that the court-appointed administrator will manage the company alone by replacing the
debtor’s management.


-----

At the end of the observation period, if it concludes that the company can survive as a going concern, the court will
adopt a safeguard or a reorganization plan, which will essentially provide for a restructuring and/or rescheduling of debts which
may only entail the partial divesture of assets rather than the entire business, to a third party (a sale of the entire business is not
possible under safeguard proceedings). At the end of the observation period of judicial reorganization proceedings and,
alternatively to a reorganization plan, the court may determine that all or part of the business should be sold to purchasers who
have submitted bids. In such a case, the court orders such a (partial or entire) sale in the framework of a so-called “asset sale
plan” (plan de cession), which consists of transferring assets, contracts and employees cherry-picked by the purchaser thereto,
for a lump sum, in accordance with the bid submitted by the purchaser during the observation period.

Judicial liquidation proceedings entail the relief of the debtor of the management and there is no observation period
in such proceedings. The outcome of liquidation proceedings, which is decided by the court without a vote of the creditors,
may be a sale of the business and/or isolated sales of the debtor’s assets in order to discharge the debtor’s liabilities. Where a
sale of the business (partial or not) is contemplated, the court may authorize a temporary continuation of the business for a
maximum period of three months (renewable once for a period of three months at the public prosecutor’s request) whose effects
are similar to an observation period.

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, a reorganization plan or an asset sale plan, it can set a time period during which
the assets that it deems to be essential to the continued business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.

The sales that have been pre-packed in mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings and that are deemed satisfactory
will be implemented in the framework of subsequent court-administered proceedings through an expeditious and derogatory
process. Such sale could only relate to part (but not all) of the business of the debtor in safeguard proceedings.

**_The “Hardening Period” (Période Suspecte) in Judicial Reorganization and Liquidation Proceedings_**

The date when the debtor becomes in a state of “cessation des paiements” is deemed to be the date of the court order
commencing the judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may
not be earlier than 18 months before the date of such court order. Also, except in the case of fraud, the insolvency date may not
be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of
conciliation proceedings (see above). The insolvency date is important because it marks the beginning of the “hardening
period ” (période suspecte), being the period from the insolvency date of the debtor to the court decision commencing the judicial
reorganization or liquidation proceedings affecting it.

Certain transactions entered into by the debtor during the hardening period are automatically void or voidable by the
court.

Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening period that may
constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors. These include transfers of
assets for no consideration or for a nominal consideration, contracts under which the reciprocal obligations of the debtor
significantly exceed those of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments of the debts that are
due made in a manner which is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business, deposits of cash or monetary instruments
ordered by a court decision that has not yet become final to serve as bond or as a precautionary measure in accordance with
Article 2350 of the French Civil Code, security granted for debts previously incurred, provisional attachment or seizure
measures (mesures conservatoires) (unless the attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to
stock options, the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as security for a
debt simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that affects assets or rights already transferred
in the trust as security for debt incurred prior to such amendment, and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure
(déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code.

Voidable transactions include, transactions for consideration, payments made on debts that are due, an notices of
attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions, in each case, if such
actions are taken after the debtor was in cessation des paiements and the court determines that the party dealing with the debtor
knew that the debtor was insolvent at the relevant time. In addition, transactions relating to transfers of assets for no
consideration and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article
L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code are also voidable when entered into during the six-month period prior to the beginning
of the hardening period.

There is no hardening period prior to the opening of safeguard proceedings, since the condition required to commence
such proceedings is that the company is not insolvent within the meaning of French law.


-----

**_Extension of Insolvency Proceedings_**

French law provides that, upon the petition of the debtor, of the public prosecutor, the court-appointed administrator,
the creditors’ representative, the controllers or the liquidator, the insolvency proceedings of a company may be extended to
another one, so that their respective assets and liabilities will be treated as belonging to one single insolvency estate, if (i) the
debtor is deemed “fictitious,” i.e. a sham, or (ii) the debtor “commingled its assets and liabilities” with another entity, i.e. either
it proves impossible to determine which assets and liabilities belong to each of them or “abnormal financial relationships”
existed between the two entities (such as transfers of assets or funds without consideration).

**_Status of Creditors During Safeguard, Judicial Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings_**

Contractual provisions pursuant to which the commencement of the proceedings triggers the acceleration of the debt
(except with respect to judicial liquidation proceedings in which the court does not order the continued operation of the
business) or the termination or cancellation of an ongoing contract are not enforceable against the debtor. Nor are “contractual
provisions modifying the conditions of continuation of an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations
of the debtor solely upon the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings” (in accordance with a decision of the French
Supreme Court (Cour de Cassation) dated January 14, 2014, n° 12-22.909, which case law is likely to be extended to safeguard,
accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings). However, the court- appointed administrator can
unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) that it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to
perform. Conversely, the court-appointed administrator can require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their
obligations even though the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its postcommencement contractual obligations (and provided that, in the case of judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation
proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on delivery). The commencement of liquidation
proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the
continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of an asset sale plan (plan de cession) as described above; in
such case, the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision adopting the asset sale plan (plan
_de cession), as described above, or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends._

During the observation period:

     - accrual of interest is suspended (except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of contracts providing
for a payment which is deferred by at least one year (however, accrued interest can no longer be compounded);

     - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings, subject to
specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set-off of related (connexes) debts and payments authorized by
the insolvency judge (juge-commissaire) to recover assets required by the continued operation of the business and
post-petition debts, unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or
in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor;

     - debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and which were incurred for the purposes of the
proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor
during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will be given priority over debts incurred
prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a “New
Money Lien”), provided that they are duly brought to the attention of the court-appointed administrator or, failing
one, the mandataire judiciaire or, should they both have ceased to be in office, the plan commissioner or the
judicial liquidator within one year of the end of the observation period;

     - in the context of judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to other terms of payment,
immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrat en cours), will be
required; and

     - creditors (only financial creditors in the case of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings) may not initiate or
pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or against a guarantor of the debtor where such guarantor
is a natural person and the proceedings are safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings) with respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings if the
objective of such legal action is:


-----

`o` to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor
may require that a court determine the amount due) in order to file a proof of claim, as described below)

`o` to terminate a contract for non-payment of amounts owed to the creditor; or

`o` to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor, except (i) in judicial liquidation
proceedings, by way of the applicable specific process for judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the
pledged assets or (ii) where such asset—whether tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable, is located
in another Member State within the European Union, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon
would not be affected by the insolvency proceedings, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the EU
Insolvency Regulation.

A natural person that is the guarantor of the debtor may avail itself of the provisions of a safeguard plan adopted by
the court but not the provisions of a judicial reorganization plan.

In accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the above rules only apply to the creditors that fall within the scope
of those proceedings. Debts owed to other creditors, such as suppliers, continue to be payable in the ordinary course of business.

As a general rule, creditors domiciled in France whose debts arose prior to the commencement of insolvency
proceedings must file a proof of claim (declaration de cr´ _eances´_ ) with the creditors’ representative within two months of the
publication of the court decision in the Bulletin Officiel des annonces civiles et commerciales (by exception, the deadline
starts upon receipt of an individual notification for those creditors whose claim arose out of a published contract or who benefit
from a published security interest); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside France. Where the
debtor has informed the creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim and no proof of a claim has been filed yet, such
claim is deemed filed with the creditors’ representative. Creditors are allowed to confirm a proof of claim made on their behalf.
Creditors who have not submitted their claims during the relevant period, whose claims are not deemed filed with the creditors’
representative save for a ratification by the creditor of a proof of claim made on its behalf, are barred, except with respect to
very limited exceptions, from receiving distributions made in accordance with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to
such limitations and are preferential creditors under French law.

Under accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the claims held by
creditors that took part in the conciliation proceedings are listed by the debtor and certified by its statutory auditor (or, in its
absence, its accountant) and are thus deemed to have been filed. Although such creditors can file proofs of claim pursuant to
the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust the amounts of their claims
as set forth on the list prepared by the debtor (within the 2 or 4 month time limit). Those creditors who did not take part in the
conciliation proceedings (but who would be members of the creditors’ committees or the bondholders’ general meeting) would
have to file their proofs of claim within the above-mentioned deadlines.

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, an accelerated safeguard plan, an accelerated financial safeguard plan or a
reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan.

If the court adopts an asset sale plan (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial reorganization or liquidation
proceedings (see above), the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment of the creditors according to the ranking
of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator in charge of
selling the assets of the company and settling the relevant debts in accordance with their ranking.

French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employee claims, postcommencement legal costs (essentially, court-officials fees), creditors who, benefit from a New Money Lien or a S/R Lien (see
above), post-commencement privileged creditors and the French State (taxes and social charges). In the event of judicial
liquidation proceedings only, certain pre-commencement secured creditors whose claim is secured by real estate are paid prior
to post-commencement privileged creditors. This order of priority does not apply to all creditors, for example it does not apply
to creditors benefiting from a retention right over certain assets with respect to their claim related to such asset.

**_Creditors’ Liability_**

Pursuant to Article L. 650-1 of the French Commercial Code (as interpreted by case law), where insolvency
proceedings judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced, creditors may only be held liable
for the losses suffered as a result of facilities granted to the debtor on the following grounds: (i) fraud; (ii) clear interference


-----

with the management (immixtion caractérisée dans la gestion) of the debtor; or (iii) if the security or guarantees taken to
support the facilities are disproportionate to such facilities. In addition, any security or guarantees taken to support facilities in
respect of which a creditor is found liable on any of these grounds can be cancelled or reduced by the court. Case law has
recently set out that this liability would also require that the granting of the facility be deemed to be wrongful.

If a creditor has repeatedly interfered in the company’s management, it can be deemed a de facto manager of such
company (“dirigeant de fait”). In such case, Article L.651-2 of the French Commercial Code provides that, if liquidation
proceedings (liquidation judiciaire) have been commenced against the debtor, the creditor may be liable for bearing the excess
of liabilities over the company’s assets, along with the other managers (whether de jure or de facto), as the case may be, if it is
established that their mismanagement has contributed to the company’s shortfall of assets. If such conditions are met, French
courts will decide whether the managers should bear all or part of the shortfall amount.

However, a manager (whether de jure or de facto) cannot be held liable on the basis of Article L. 651-2 of the French
Commercial Code in cases of “simple negligence” (simple négligence) in the management of the company.

**_Limitation on French Guarantors’ Guarantee_**

The liabilities and obligations of the French Guarantors are subject to:

     - certain exceptions, including to the extent of any obligations which would constitute prohibited financial
assistance within the meaning of Article L. 225-216 of the French Commercial Code or infringement of the
provisions of Articles L. 241-3, L. 242-6 or L. 244-1 of the French Commercial Code; and

     - French corporate benefit rules.

Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing indebtedness of another
company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition.

French law requires that, when a French company grants a guarantee on third-party obligations, the guarantee must
be in the corporate purposes and in the corporate interests of the guarantor company. Under French corporate benefit rules, a
guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee, taken
as a whole. A court could declare any guarantee unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant
guarantee, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if it found that these criteria were not fulfilled.
The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the
benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance.

Accordingly, the Guarantee granted by any French Guarantor and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited,
at any time, to an amount equal to the aggregate of the proceeds of the Notes to the extent directly or indirectly on-lent by the
Issuer to that French Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries or used to refinance any indebtedness previously directly or indirectly
on-lent to that French Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries, in each case under intercompany loans or similar arrangements, and
outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such French Guarantor under its Guarantee. Any payment made
by such French Guarantor under its Guarantee in respect of the obligations of any other obligor shall reduce pro tanto the
outstanding amount of the intercompany loans or similar arrangements due by such French Guarantor or its subsidiaries under
the intercompany loan or similar arrangements referred to above. By virtue of this limitation, the amount of the French
Guarantor’s obligations as Guarantor under the Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the
Notes, and the French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation as Guarantor under the Guarantee should the portion of
the proceeds of the Notes made available to such French Guarantor directly or indirectly be equal to zero.

In addition, if any French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic return that is less than
the economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on an arm’s length basis, the difference
between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable arm’s length transaction could be taxable under certain
circumstances.

The limitation language for the obligations of the French Guarantors to be incorporated into the relevant Notes
documents and in particular in the Indenture, will substantially be in the form as follows:

(a) “The obligations and liabilities of the French Guarantors under the Notes and in particular under the guarantee
clause of the Indenture shall not include any obligation or liability which, if incurred, would constitute the


-----

provision of financial assistance within the meaning of Article L. 225-216 of the French Code de Commerce
and/or would constitute a misuse of corporate assets within the meaning of Articles L. 244-1, L. 242-6 or L.
241-3 of the French Commercial Code or any other law or regulation having the same effect, as interpreted by
French courts.

(b) The obligations and liabilities of any French Guarantor under the guarantee clause of the Indenture for the
obligations under the Notes of any other Obligor which is not a Subsidiary of such French Guarantor shall be
limited, at any time to an amount equal to the aggregate of all amounts directly or indirectly borrowed under
the Notes by such other Obligor to the extent directly or indirectly on-lent to such French Guarantor or any of
its subsidiaries or used to refinance any indebtedness previously directly or indirectly on-lent to that French
Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries, in each case under intercompany loan or similar arrangements, and
outstanding at the date a payment is to be made by such French Guarantor under the guarantee clause of the
Indenture; it being specified that any payment made by the French Guarantor under the guarantee clause of
the Indenture in respect of the obligations of such Obligor shall reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount of
the intercompany loans or similar arrangements due by such French Guarantor under the intercompany loan
or similar agreements referred to above and that any repayment of the intercompany loans or similar
arrangements by the French Guarantor shall reduce pro tanto the amount payable under the guarantee clause
of the Indenture.

(c) The obligations and liabilities of any French Guarantor under the guarantee clause of the Indenture for the
obligations under the Notes of any other Obligor which is its Subsidiary shall not be limited and shall therefore
cover all amounts due by such Obligor as Issuer and/or as Guarantor. However, where such Subsidiary is itself
a Guarantor which guarantees the obligations of a member of the Group which is not a Subsidiary of the French
Guarantor, the amounts payable by such French Guarantor under this paragraph (c) in respect of the
obligations of this Subsidiary as Guarantor, shall be limited as set out in paragraph (b) above.

(d) It will be acknowledged that, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, no French
Guarantor is acting jointly and severally with the other Guarantors as to its obligations pursuant to the
guarantee given pursuant to the guarantee clause of the Indenture.

(e) For the purpose of paragraphs (b) to (c) above “Subsidiary” means, in relation to any company, another
company which is controlled by it within the meaning of Article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code.”

**_Fraudulent Conveyance_**

French law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside of insolvency
proceedings, called action paulienne provisions. The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease in their
means of recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which such
debtor guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of such
debtor’s or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal
act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency proceedings of the debtor by the creditors’ representative
(mandataire judiciaire), the commissioner of the safeguard or reorganization plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan)
insolvency proceedings of the relevant debtor, or by any of the creditors of the relevant debtor outside the insolvency
proceedings or any creditor who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside insolvency
proceedings. Any such legal act may be declared unenforceable against third parties if: (i) the debtor performed such acts
without an obligation to do so; (ii) the creditor concerned or, in the case of the debtor’s insolvency proceedings, any creditor,
was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the act was performed both the debtor
and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of such debtor’s creditors (existing or
future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), in
which case such knowledge of the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on grounds of fraudulent conveyance.
If a court found that the issuance of the Notes, or the granting of a Guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not
qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the Notes, or the granting of such Guarantee could be declared
unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the creditor that lodged the claim in relation to the relevant
act. As a result of such successful challenges, the holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the Notes, the Guarantee and
the value of any consideration that the holders of the Notes received with respect to the Notes, or the Guarantee could also be
subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes and, possibly, from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such
circumstances, the holders of the Notes might be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or
the Guarantor as a result of the fraudulent conveyance.

**_Other French Security Law Considerations_**

_Recognition of intercreditor arrangements by French courts_

There is no law or published decision of the French courts of appeal or of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation)
on the validity or enforceability of the obligations of an agreement such as the Intercreditor Agreement, except for Articles L.
626-30-2, L. 626-32 and L. 631-19 of the French Commercial Code pursuant to which, in the context of safeguard or judicial
reorganization proceedings, the safeguard or reorganization plan which is put to the vote of the creditors’ committees and the
bondholders general meeting takes into consideration (prend en compte) the provisions of subordination agreements between
creditors which were entered into prior to the commencement of the safeguard, or judicial reorganization, proceedings. As a
consequence, except to the extent referred to above (which, as at the date of this Offering Memorandum, has received no judicial
interpretation), we cannot rule out that a French court would not give effect to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**Germany**

**_Insolvency_**

Several of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany and have their registered office in Germany. There
is a rebuttable presumption that the “centre of main interests” as defined in the Recast Insolvency Regulation (see above) is the
jurisdiction where the registered office is situated. Consequently, any insolvency proceedings with regard to such Guarantors
(together, the “German Guarantors”), is likely to be initiated in Germany and, if the German Guarantors were held to have
their respective centre of main interests within the territory of Germany at the time the application for the opening of insolvency
proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed, German insolvency law would most likely govern such proceedings. Under
certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings may also be opened in Germany in accordance with German law over the assets
of companies that are not established under German law (for example, if the center of main interests of such company is within
Germany) or, vice versa, insolvency over a Guarantor may be opened in other jurisdictions. The insolvency laws of Germany
and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) may not be as favorable to creditors as
the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including, inter alia, in respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain
post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit the ability of the recovery of
payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. However, pursuant to
the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the jurisdiction of the German courts may be limited if the company’s “centre of main
interests” is found to be in a Member State other than Germany. This issue is to be determined at the time when the competent
court decides on the commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings.

**_A Brief Description of Certain Aspects of the Insolvency Laws of Germany_**

Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which generally means that, despite the economic
ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be one separate insolvency proceeding for each of the
entities if and to the extent there exists an insolvency reason on the part of the relevant entity. Each of these insolvency
proceedings will be legally independent from all other insolvency proceedings (if any) within a group of companies. In
particular, there is no consolidation of assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency and no pooling
of claims among the respective entities of a group. On April 12, 2018, the act to facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies
(Gesetz zur Erleichterung der Bewältigung von Konzerninsolvenzen) came into force. However, this act mainly provides for
coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies. The act does not provide for a
consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of
a group of companies or pooling of claims amongst the respective entities of a group, but rather stipulates four key amendments
of the German Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may
be competent for each group entity insolvency proceedings; (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator
for all group companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency
administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings”
(Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordination insolvency administrator” (Koordinationsverwalter) with the
ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan).

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex officio,
but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag).
Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung)
of the debtor or if the debtor is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due (Zahlungsunfähigkeit). According to the
relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the
value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business as a going concern in the


-----

next 12 months is predominantly likely (positive Fortführungsprognose). As a guideline, the debtor is deemed illiquid if it is
unable to pay its debts when they fall due, i.e. the debtor is unable to pay 10% or more of its due and payable liabilities during
the subsequent three weeks, unless it is virtually certain that the company can close the liquidity gap shortly thereafter
(demnächst) and it can be deemed acceptable to the creditor to continue to wait for the payments owed by such debtor. If a
stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft - AG), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea - SE) or
a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung - GmbH) or any company not having an individual as
personally liable shareholder becomes illiquid and/or over-indebted, the management of such company and, under certain
circumstances, its shareholders are obliged to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay, however, at
the latest within three weeks after the occurrence of illiquidity and six weeks after the occurrence of over-indebtedness. Noncompliance with these obligations exposes management to both severe damage claims as well as sanctions under criminal law.
In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) is a valid insolvency reason under German law which exists
if the company is currently able to service its payments obligations, but will presumably not be able to continue to do so at
some point in time within a certain prognosis period. As a rule, a forecast period of 24 months is to be taken as a basis. A debtor
is therefore imminently illiquid (but not yet over-indebted), if he will likely be able to satisfy its liabilities in the next 12, but
not in the next 24 months. However, only the debtor, but not the creditors, is entitled (but not obliged) to file for the opening
of insolvency proceedings in the event of an imminent illiquidity of the debtor.

On March 27, 2020, the German Act on the temporary suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency and on the
limitation of managing directors’ liability in case of insolvency caused by the COVID 19 pandemic (COVID-19_Insolvenzaussetzungsgesetz – “COVInsAG”) entered into force with retroactive effect as of March 1, 2020. By a law of_
September 25, 2020 (and with effect as of October 1, 2020), the COVInsAG has been partially extended. According to this
version of the COVInsAG, the obligation to file for insolvency due to over-indebtedness was suspended until December 31,
2020. However, this did not apply to companies whose over-indebtedness was not resulting from the consequences of the
coronavirus pandemic. By amendment of the COVInsAG with effect of February 1, 2021 the obligation to file an insolvency
petition under the aforementioned conditions is suspended until, currently, April 30, 2021 if (i) the debtor has filed for an
application for financial assistance under governmental assistance programs to mitigate the consequences of the coronavirus
pandemic in the period from November 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021 or (ii) the debtor falls within the group of beneficiaries
of these governmental assistance programs, but it was not possible to submit an application for factual or legal reasons. The
COVInsAG also provides for a certain relief from claw-back provisions, if the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the
suspension of filing duties, inter alia for the satisfaction of claims or the provision of collateral for these claims, which the
creditor was entitled to receive and unless the creditor knew that the restructuring and refinancing efforts of the debtor were
not suitable to eliminate an existing illiquidity of the debtor in the meaning of section 17 of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung) (see also below). Furthermore, for an interim period until December 31, 2021, the COVInsAG reduces the
forecast period (Fortführungsprognose) relevant for determining whether a continuation of the debtor’s business is
predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) for the purposes of the assessment of the insolvency ground of overindebtedness from twelve months to four months provided that the debtor’s over-indebtedness is caused by the COVID-19
Pandemic, which is assumed if (i) the debtor was not illiquid as of December 31, 2019, (ii) the debtor’s result from its ordinary
business activity was positive in the last financial year prior to January 1, 2020, and (iii) the revenue from the debtors’ ordinary
business activity in calendar year 2020 was more than 30% lower than the revenue in calendar year 2019.

The insolvency proceedings are controlled by the competent insolvency court which monitors the due performance of
the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary measures (vorläufige
_Maßnahmen) to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings (vorläufiges Insolvenzverfahren). The_
insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s moveable assets
during these preliminary proceedings. In addition, the court will generally also appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator
(vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter), unless the debtor has petitioned for debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) - an
insolvency proceeding in which the debtor’s management generally remains in charge of administering the debtor’s business
affairs under the supervision of a custodian (Sachwalter). The order for opening an insolvency proceeding as debtor-inpossession proceeding requires that (i) it has been requested by the debtor with a detailed and coherent debtor-in-possession
planning (Eigenverwaltungsplanung) and (ii) no circumstances are known which indicate that the self-administration plan is
based on inaccurate facts in material respects. In case of self-administration, the court shall refrain from (i) imposing on the
debtor a general prohibition on making dispositions or (ii) ordering that all of the debtor’s dispositions are effective only with
the consent of a preliminary insolvency administrator. In this case, instead of a preliminary insolvency administrator, a
preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter) shall be appointed who shall supervise the management of the debtor in the
preliminary insolvency proceeding (vorläufige Eigenverwaltung).

If the debtor has filed a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings based on an insolvency reason other than
illiquidity (i.e., imminent illiquidity or over-indebtedness), combined with a petition to initiate such process based on a debtorin-possession status and can prove (by way of a certification provided by a tax advisor, accountant or lawyer with experience


-----

in insolvency matters or a person with comparable qualifications) that there is no illiquidity and a restructuring of its business
is not obviously futile (offensichtlich aussichtslos), the court shall, upon the request of the debtor, set a deadline of up to three
months for submission of an insolvency plan, so-called “protective shield” (Schutzschirm). In addition, for an interim period
until December 31, 2021, debtors have access to the protective shield proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren) even in the state of
illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) provided that the debtor’s illiquidity was caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This is assumed
if (i) the debtor was not illiquid as of December 31, 2019, (ii) the debtor’s result from its ordinary business activity was positive
in the last financial year prior to January 1, 2020, and (iii) the revenue from the debtors’ ordinary business activity in calendar
year 2020 was more than 30% lower than the revenue in calendar year 2019. During this period, the creditors’ rights to enforce
security may - upon application of the filing debtor - be suspended. Under these circumstances, the insolvency court has to
appoint a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter) to supervise the process. The debtor is entitled to suggest an individual
to be appointed as custodian with such suggestion being binding on the insolvency court unless the suggested person is
obviously not eligible to become a custodian (i.e., is obviously not competent or impartial).

Depending on the size of the debtor’s business operations and several other circumstances, the insolvency court must
or may appoint a preliminary creditors’ committee (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss). The preliminary creditors’ committee
will be asked for their view on a petition for debtor-in-possession status, or on the profile of the (preliminary) insolvency
administrator to be appointed or to suggest a particular individual to be appointed by the court. In case the members of the
preliminary creditors’ committee unanimously agree on an individual, such suggestion is binding on the court (unless the
suggested individual is not eligible; i.e., not competent and/or not impartial). To ensure that the preliminary creditors’ committee
reflects the interests of all creditor constituencies, it shall comprise a representative of the secured creditors, one for the large
creditors and one for the small creditors as well as one for the employees.

The duties of the preliminary insolvency administrator are, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the debtor’s
assets (which, depending on the circumstances, includes the continuation of the business carried out by the debtor), to verify
the existence of an insolvency reason and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the
insolvency proceedings. The court orders the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens)
if certain requirements are met, in particular if there are sufficient assets (Insolvenzmasse) to cover at least the costs of the
insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open formal
insolvency proceedings if third parties (e.g., creditors) advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings will be dismissed for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse).

Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) (usually, but
not necessarily, the same person who acted as preliminary insolvency administrator) is appointed by the insolvency court unless
a debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered. In case the court orders for a debtor-in-possession status, the
debtor’s management generally remains in charge of administering the debtor’s business affairs under the supervision of a
custodian (Sachwalter). In the absence of a debtor-in-possession status, the right to administer the debtor’s business affairs and
to dispose of the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator with the insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger)
only being entitled to request the change of the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first
creditors’ assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by head
count and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual becoming the new insolvency
administrator and (ii) the proposed individual be eligible as officeholder (i.e., sufficiently qualified, business-experienced and
impartial). The insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s
business. These new liabilities incurred by the insolvency administrator qualify as preferential claims against the estate
(Masseverbindlichkeiten) which are preferred to any insolvency claim of an unsecured creditor (with the residual claim of a
secured insolvency creditor remaining after realization of the available collateral (if any) also qualifying as unsecured
insolvency claim).

From the perspective of the holders of the Notes, among others, some important consequences of such opening of
formal insolvency proceedings against any German Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries that are subject to the
German insolvency regime would be the following:

     - the right to administer and dispose of the assets of the insolvent entity would generally pass to the insolvency
administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate, unless the court orders debtorin-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung);

     - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) with respect to such insolvent entity,
disposals effected by the management of such insolvent entity, after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings,
are null and void by operation of law;


-----

     - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter, a creditor in the
insolvency proceedings has acquired through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of such
insolvent entity’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and
void by operation of law upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings;

     - claims against such insolvent entity may only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth in the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and

     - any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderungsrecht) (i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not
constitute part of the insolvency estate) does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for separation
must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator.

Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses” entitling one party
to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of insolvency
proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of
insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid if they frustrate the
election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not to perform the contract (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters) unless
they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law. This will likely also relate to agreements that are not governed
by German law.

Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the
opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until the
insolvency administrators opt for performance.

All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the insolvency estate
(Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)), wishing to assert claims against the insolvent
debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and
creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance
with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled
to enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however, secured creditors
have certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal nature of the security interest entitlement to
enforce such security is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. In this context, it should be
noted that the insolvency administrator generally has the sole right to realize any moveable assets in his/the debtor’s possession
which are subject to preferential rights (e.g., liens over movable assets (Mobiliarsicherungsrechte) or security transfer of title
(Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements
(Sicherungsabtretungen). In the case of creditors secured by pledges over shares or company interests forming part of the
insolvency estate it is, in the absence of authoritative case law, uncertain whether the creditors are entitled to initiate the
enforcement process in respect of the pledged shares on their own or whether the insolvency administrator has the right to
realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of the secured creditors.

In case the enforcement right is vested with the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain
contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets
(Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds plus VAT (if any), are
disbursed to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. With
the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor the insolvency administrator has to satisfy the creditors of the insolvency
estate (Massegläubiger) first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as well as any preferred liabilities incurred by
the insolvency estate after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings). Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims—
_Insolvenzforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there_
is value remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) after the security interest and the preferential claims against the
estate have been settled and paid in full.

The preferential right (Absonderungsrecht) of a creditor may not necessarily prevent the insolvency administrator
from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator must, however, compensate the creditor
for any loss of value resulting from such use.

Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be subordinated
by law, while claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency
proceedings (Massegläubiger) generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. Claims of subordinated


-----

creditors in the insolvency proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the claims of other nonsubordinated creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied.

The unencumbered assets of the debtor serve to satisfy the costs of the insolvency proceeding (Kosten des
_Insolvenzverfahrens) first and afterwards the preferred creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger). Typically, liabilities_
resulting from acts of the insolvency administrator after commencement of formal insolvency proceedings constitute liabilities
of the insolvency estate. Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims (Insolvenzforderungen)), in particular claims of
unsecured creditors, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is value remaining in the insolvency estate
(Insolvenzmasse). It may take several years before an insolvency dividend (if any) is distributed to unsecured creditors. In
insolvency proceedings over the assets of a German Guarantor, the claims of the holders of the Notes against such German
Guarantor under the Guarantees would only rank as unsecured insolvency claim. German insolvency law also provides for
certain creditors to be subordinated by law.

The following subordinated claims shall be satisfied ranking below the other unsubordinated claims of insolvency
creditors in the order given herein, and in proportion to their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty
payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency creditors from the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred
by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and
administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offense binding the debtor to
pay money; (iv) claims on the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration; (v) claims for the restitution of shareholder
loans (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms to such a loan; and
(vi) claims which the creditor and the debtor agreed to be subordinated in insolvency proceedings. The COVInsAG, however,
suspends the statutory subordination of shareholder loans and receivables from economically similar acts in insolvency
proceedings applied for up until September 30, 2023 for newly granted shareholder loans that were granted between March 1,
2020 and April 30, 2021 and where the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of the filing duties at the time.

Under certain circumstances, restrictive covenants and undertakings in finance documents may result in the relevant
creditor being considered to hold a “shareholder-like position” (gesellschafterähnliche Stellung) in the insolvent entity. In that
event, in an insolvency proceeding over the assets of such insolvent entity, the claims against that entity would be treated as a
subordinated insolvency claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen) in accordance with the rules applying to shareholder loans.
A third party acquiring the claims that are subject to the rules of the treatment of shareholder loans will itself be exposed inter
alia to a claw back risk with respect to repayments that have been made within the period of one year prior to the request to
open insolvency proceedings or subsequent to such request (section 135 of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung)).
Subordinated insolvency claims are not eligible to participate in the insolvency proceedings over the assets of the debtor (or in
any transaction security) unless the insolvency court handling the case has granted special permission allowing these
subordinated insolvency claims to be filed which is not granted in the majority of insolvency cases governed by German law.
To the extent any creditor that benefited from the transaction security was a subordinated creditor, potential sharing and
equalization provisions in the finance documents could result in holders who are not subordinated suffering a shortfall on the
amount they recover.

While in ordinary insolvency proceedings aiming at the liquidation of the relevant insolvent debtor, the value of the
insolvent entity’s assets may be realized by a piecemeal sale or, as the case may be, by a bulk sale of the entity’s business as a
going concern, a different approach aiming at the restructuring and preservation of such entities can be taken based on an
insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan). The insolvency plan may – to some extent – deviate from the provisions of the German
Insolvency Code for regular insolvency proceedings and may, for example, also include (and restrict) under certain
circumstances the security rights of the creditor vis-à-vis other group companies not being insolvent (gruppeninterne
_Drittsicherheiten). Such plan can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires, among other things_
and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules and the
approval of the insolvency court (while a group of dissenting creditors or the debtor can - under certain circumstances - be
crammed down). The insolvent entity itself may only oppose the proposed plan if the plan is detrimental to the insolvent
company (in comparison to an ordinary insolvency proceeding) or if any creditor will receive a higher economic value than the
amount of its claim. If the debtor is a corporate entity, also the shares or, as the case may be, the membership rights in the debtor
can be included in the insolvency plan (e.g., they can be transferred to third parties, including a transfer to creditors based on a
debt-to-equity swap). In this case, the adoption of the insolvency plan generally also requires the consent of the group of the
shareholders. However, the group of dissenting shareholders can - under certain circumstances - also be crammed down.

Under the German Insolvency Code, the insolvency administrator (or in case of debtor-in-possession proceedings, the
custodian) may void (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors
and which were effected prior to the commencement of formal insolvency proceedings during applicable voidable periods.
Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are successfully voided by the insolvency administrator, any amounts or


-----

other benefits derived from such challenged transaction, performance or act will have to be returned to the insolvency estate
plus accrued interest. The administrator’s (or custodian's) right to void transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend
to transactions having occurred up to ten years prior to the filing for the commencement of insolvency proceedings. In the event
of insolvency proceedings with respect to any insolvent entity based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the
payment of any amounts to the holders for or providing credit support for the benefit of the notes could be subject to potential
challenges (i.e., clawback rights) by an insolvency administrator under the rules of avoidance as set out in the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). In the event such a transaction is successfully voided (angefochten), the holders of the
notes may not be able to recover or retain any amounts under the notes and may participate in the insolvency proceedings as
unsecured creditor only. If payments have already been made under the notes,any amounts received from a transaction that had
been voided would have to be repaid (plus accrued interest) to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). In this case, the holders
of the notes may only have a general unsecured claim under the notes without preference in insolvency proceedings.

In particular, a legal act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes the granting of
a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the creditors of the debtor may be voided
according to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in the following cases:

     - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction
(Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months prior to the filing of the petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings, provided that the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time such act
was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of circumstances that clearly suggest that the debtor was
illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor
knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances that clearly suggest such
illiquidity or filing);

     - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction
(Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled, or which was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to
which or at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (i) such act was taken during
the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii)
such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid
at such time or (iii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was
detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that clearly suggest such
detrimental effect);

     - a legal transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the debtor
loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes
enforceable, if it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such
transaction knew of the illiquidity at such time or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction knew either of the debtor’s illiquidity or of such filing at the
time of the transaction;

     - any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security or as paid for a
third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected
in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings;

     - any act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the intention of prejudicing its insolvency
creditors (vorsätzliche Gläubigerbenachteiligung) and the beneficiary of the act knew of such intention at the
time of such act. Such intention of the debtor and the respective knowledge of the beneficiary shall be presumed
if the debtor and the beneficiary knew of the debtor’s imminent insolvency, and that the transaction constituted a
disadvantage for the creditors; in the case that the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain,
security or satisfaction for a debt, the avoidability of acts is limited to four years. In the case that the relevant act
granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt to which such creditor was
entitled in that form and that time, knowledge of such creditor of the intention of the debtor to prejudice its
insolvency creditors shall (only) be presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was actually illiquid
(eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors. The fact that the


-----

creditor agreed on a payment plan with the debtor, or agreed to deferred payments, shall establish the presumption
that he had no knowledge of the debtor being illiquid at this time;

     - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party that directly operates to the
detriment of the creditors can be voided unless such contract was concluded earlier than two years prior to the
filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s
intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time the contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities,
the term “affiliated party” includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management board or
supervisory board, general partners and shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons
or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of
the debtor, and other persons who are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing
persons;

     - any act that provides security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a claim of a shareholder for repayment of a
shareholder loan or a similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security, the act took place during the last
ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such
petition or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition
for the opening of the insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition; or

     - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third
party if (i) the satisfaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings or thereafter, and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor
(Garant) or provider of surety (Bürge) (in which case not the third party but the shareholder must compensate the
debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the
conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening
of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors,
as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if he
or she knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or imminent illiquidity, as the case may be, and that the transaction prejudiced the
debtor’s creditors. With respect to an “affiliated party,” there is a general statutory presumption that such party had
“knowledge.”

The granting of security concurrently with the incurrence of debt may be qualified as a “cash transaction”
(Bargeschäft). In case of such “cash transaction,” the avoidance risk can—under certain circumstances—substantially be
reduced.

However, according to the COVInsAG, the avoidance rights of an insolvency administrator are temporarily reduced
in order to privilege new financings and shareholder loans made during a certain time during the COVID-19 pandemic. On that
basis, the repayment (including reasonable interest payments) of third-party financing and shareholder loans by September 30,
2023 shall not be considered disadvantageous to creditors if the relevant financing is granted between March 1, 2020 and April
30, 2021 and the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of the filing duties at the time. This privilege also covers
the provision of collateral in favor of third-party financing providers, but does not apply in case of the provision of collateral
to secure the repayment of shareholder loans or receivables resulting from legal transactions which are economically equivalent
to a loan.

Moreover, according to the COVInsAG, any congruent securities or satisfactions (i.e. securities or satisfactions that
could be claimed in the manner and at the time) and certain incongruent securities or satisfactions being provided during the
suspension period shall generally not be subject to any avoidance rights in subsequent insolvency proceedings (unless the
creditor knew that the restructuring and refinancing efforts of the debtor were not suitable to eliminate an existing illiquidity of
the debtor in the meaning of section 17 of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung)). In the case of deferrals, payments
until March 31, 2022 on receivables for which a deferral was agreed until February 28, 2021 shall generally also not be subject
to any avoidance rights in subsequent insolvency proceedings, provided that insolvency proceedings had not yet been opened
against the debtor's assets by the end of February 18, 2021.

However, these privileges in terms of avoidance rights do only apply in the framework of the COVInsAG.


-----

Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator voiding transactions according to the German Insolvency
Code (Insolvenzordnung) described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) could
possibly also void any security right or payment performed under the relevant security right according to the German Law of
Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz) in the absence of formal insolvency proceedings. The prerequisites vary to a certain extent from
the rules described above and the avoidance periods are calculated from the date a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in
the courts.

**_Preventive Restructuring Framework_**

On January 1, 2021 the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (“StaRuG”), which implemented the EU
Restructuring Directive entered into force. The StaRuG inter alia introduces a pre-insolvency restructuring procedure
(“StaRuG-Scheme”). Through the early restructuring of its liabilities, a debtor shall be enabled to continue its business, in
whole or in part, by changing the composition, conditions or structure of its assets and liabilities or any other part of its capital
structure and thereby prevent insolvency proceedings. The prerequisite for a StaRuG-Scheme is that the debtor is imminently
illiquid (drohend zahlungsunfähig), but not yet illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) or over-indebted (überschuldet). Restructuring
proceedings under the StaRuG are initiated by an application of the debtor to the competent court and the submission of a
restructuring concept.

The key instrument of a StaRuG-Scheme is the restructuring plan (Restrukturierungsplan), in which the debtor can
include all or only some of its creditors. The restructuring plan may address the creditors' claims
(Restrukturierungsforderungen) and potential separation rights (Absonderungsanwartschaften), but also intra-group securities
(gruppeninterne Drittsicherheiten) and the rights of the shareholders. To become effective, the plan requires the consent of the
creditors, who - similar to the insolvency plan procedure (see above) - are divided into different groups. In principle, each group
of creditors needs to consent to the plan with a majority of 75% of the value of the claims represented in that group. Despite
the lack of approval of a group of creditors, the court may in principle put the restructuring plan into effect (“cram-down”) if
(i) the majority of the creditor groups have agreed, (ii) the members of the dissenting group are not expected to be worse off
by the plan than they would be without it, and (iii) the members of this group will receive a fair share of the economic value of
the plan.

Upon request of the debtor, the court can order additional measures to ensure a successful restructuring. In particular,
it can temporarily prohibit the enforcement of claims (Vollstreckungssperre) and the realization of securities
(Verwertungssperre). At the request of the debtor (or under certain conditions ex officio) the court may appoint a restructuring
practitioner (Sanierungsbeauftragter).

Therefore, as a general rule, the claims against the Guarantors (if the Guarantors have their “center of main interests”
(COMI) in Germany and the StaRuG therefore applies) may be subject to certain restructuring measures (and even a haircut)
under the StaRuG, if the Guarantor became imminent illiquid.

Restructuring plans which are public and confirmed by a German restructuring court will be recognized in any EU
member state pursuant to the EU Insolvency Proceedings Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament
and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings) upon such proceeding being included as a recognized
proceeding in Exhibit A of that Regulation. In any other case, the recognition of the restructuring plan is subject to certain rules
and regulations under applicable international private law.

**_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_**

In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to a German subsidiary of the Issuer based on and governed by
the insolvency laws of Germany, an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) or in the event debtor-in-possession status
has been granted, the preliminary trustee (Sachwalter) may possibly challenge (anfechten) under the rules of avoidance as set
out in the German insolvency code (Insolvenzordnung) (i) a guarantee granted by that entity or (ii) payments that have been
made (under the Guarantee), if such payments have already been made. For details of such voidance rights, see “— _Insolvency.”_

**_Creditor Liability_**

The beneficiary of a transaction effecting a repayment of the stated share capital of the grantor of a guarantee could
moreover become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof)
ruled that this could be the case if for example the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the
position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of contra bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such
intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of


-----

the guarantee has been close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto. Under such
circumstances, the Guarantees may also be invalid.

**_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees_**

Each of the German Guarantors guaranteeing is established in the form of a German limited liability company
(Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) (“GmbH”) (each a “German GmbH Subsidiary Guarantor”) or as a limited
partnership with a limited liability company as general partner (“GmbH & Co. KG”) (hereinafter jointly referred to as a
“German Subsidiary Guarantors” and each a “German Subsidiary Guarantor”). Consequently, the granting of a Guarantee
by such German Subsidiary Guarantor is subject to certain provisions relating to preservation of the statutory capital under the
German Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbHG”). These
provisions would also apply to any future guarantor incorporated in the form of a GmbH or established as a limited partnership
with a limited liability company as general.

The enforcement of the relevant Guarantee will be limited if, and to the extent, payments under the Guarantee would
cause the amount of such German Subsidiary Guarantor’s (or in the case the German Subsidiary Guarantor is a GmbH & Co.
KG, its general partner’s) net assets (i.e., total assets less liabilities and liability reserves) in accordance with the German
Commercial Code (HGB) to fall below the amount of its stated share capital.

As a general rule, the provisions of the GmbHG prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its shareholders to the
extent that the amount of the GmbHs net assets would fall below the amount of its stated share capital (Stammkapital) or an
already negative amount of its net assets would further be reduced and prohibit payments to shareholders which render the
German Subsidiary Guarantor unable to pay its debts as they fall due. Guarantees by a German Subsidiary Guarantor in respect
of liabilities or payments of a direct or indirect parent or sister company as well as payments under any arrangements that are
not at arm’s length terms are considered disbursements under the provisions of the GmbHG.

In order to enable German Subsidiary Guarantors to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company
without the risk of violating the provisions of the GmbHG and to limit any potential personal liability of management, it is
standard market practice for credit agreements, indentures and guarantees to contain so called “limitation language” in relation
to subsidiaries incorporated in Germany in the legal form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG.

Pursuant to such “limitation language”, the secured parties contractually agree, subject to certain exceptions, to enforce
the guarantees against a German subsidiary which is a GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG (or to release the proceeds of an enforcement,
as applicable) only if and to the extent that such enforcement does not result in the subsidiary’s— or, in case of a GmbH & Co.
KG, in the general partner’s—net asset falling below the amount of its stated share capital or increasing such shortfall in order
to avoid a violation of the applicable provisions of the GmbHG. Accordingly, as a matter of German corporate law, the
documentation with respect to the Guarantee, to the extent provided by a German Subsidiary Guarantor, contains or will contain
such contractual limitation language. This could lead to a situation in which the respective Guarantee granted by such German
Subsidiary Guarantor cannot be enforced at all and the holders of the Notes will lose the benefit of the Guarantee.

The German capital maintenance rules and the other provisions referred to above are subject to evolving case law. We
cannot assure you that future court rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of German Subsidiary
Guarantors, which can negatively affect the ability of the Issuer to make payment on the notes or of a German Subsidiary
Guarantor to make payments on the Guarantee.

In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof)
regarding so called “destructive interference” (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a shareholder deprives a
German Subsidiary Guarantor of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts
with respect to the enforcement of the Guarantee granted by a German Subsidiary Guarantor. In such case, the amount of
proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero. According to a decision of the German Federal
Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a
creditor knows about the distressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant
collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply
this case law with respect to the granting of the Guarantee by a German Subsidiary Guarantor. Furthermore, the beneficiary of
a transaction effecting a repayment of the stated share capital of the respective German Subsidiary Guarantor of the Guarantee
could become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof)
ruled that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the
position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention
could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that a German Subsidiary


-----

Guarantor when granting the Guarantee was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect
thereto.

**Italy**

**_Limitations on Granting Security Interests and Guarantees under Italian Law_**

Under Italian law, the entry into a transaction (including the creation of a security interest or the granting of a
guarantee) by a company incorporated under Italian law must be permitted by the applicable laws and by its by-laws (statuto
_sociale) and is subject to compliance with the rules on corporate benefit, corporate authorization and certain other Italian_
mandatory provisions. If a security interest or a guarantee is being provided in the context of an acquisition, group
reorganization, refinancing or restructuring, financial assistance issues may also be triggered.

**_Corporate Benefit_**

An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a guarantee or a security interest) must receive a
real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee or the security interest being provided by such company. The concept
of real and adequate benefit is not defined in the applicable legislation, is assessed and determined by a factual analysis on a
case by case basis and its existence is a business decision of the directors and the statutory auditors, if any. As a general rule,
corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant company on a stand-alone basis, although upon certain
circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into
consideration. While corporate benefit for downstream guarantee or security (i.e., a guarantee guaranteeing or a security interest
granted to secure financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) is usually self-evident, the
validity and effectiveness of up-stream or cross stream security or guarantee (i.e., security or guarantee granted to secure
financial obligations of the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor) granted by an entity organized
under the laws of Italy depend on the existence of a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the granted security interest or
guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be proved that the grantor may derive adequate benefits or advantages from the
granting of such guarantee or security. In particular, in case of an up-stream and cross-stream guarantee or security for the
financial obligations of group companies, examples may include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows
through intercompany loans from other members of the group, while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions to
shareholders are largely untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to whether and to what extent
such transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate benefit and conflict of interest. Generally, the risk assumed by an
Italian grantor of security or guarantor under a guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit
to it.

As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the transaction (including granting a security
interest or a guarantee entered into) by an Italian company ultra vires and potentially affected by a conflict of interest and the
related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be the subject matter of challenges and annulment.
Civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of an Italian grantor if a court holds that it did not act in the best interest of the
grantor and that the acts carried out do not fall within the corporate purpose of the company or were against mandatory
provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also result in the imposition of civil liabilities on those companies
or persons ultimately exercising control over an Italian grantor or having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such
improper control. Moreover if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party and such
third party acted intentionally against the interest of the Italian company, this could have an impact on the effectiveness and
enforceability of the security interest or guarantee granted by such Italian company.

The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to up-stream, cross-stream and down-stream guarantees or
security interests granted by Italian companies.

Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity within the
meaning of Article 106 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993 (the “Italian Banking Act”), whose
exercise is exclusively demanded to banks and authorized financial intermediaries. Non-compliance with the provisions of the
Italian Banking Act may, among others, entail the relevant guarantees being considered null and void. In this respect, Italian
Ministerial Decree No. 53 of April 2, 2015, implementing Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Italian Banking Act, states that the
issuance of guarantees or the granting of security by a company for the obligations of another company which is part of the
same group does not qualify as a restricted financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling and controlled companies
within the meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as companies which are under the control of the same
entity. As a result of the above described rules, subject to the relevant guarantors and the guaranteed entity being part of the
same group of companies, the provision of the guarantees would not amount to a restricted financial activity.


-----

**_Financial Assistance_**

In addition, the granting of a security or a guarantee by an Italian company cannot include any liability which would
result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 or 2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code
pursuant to which, subject to specific exceptions, it is unlawful for a company to give financial assistance (whether by means
of loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) to support (directly or indirectly) the acquisition or subscription by a third party of
its own shares or quotas or those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls the Italian company. Financial assistance for
refinancing indebtedness originally incurred for the purchase or subscription of its own shares or quotas or those of its direct
or indirect parent company would also be a violation of financial assistance provisions. Any loan, guarantee or security given
or granted in breach of these provisions is null and void. In addition, directors may be personally liable for failure to act in the
best interests of the company.

**_Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code_**

Pursuant to Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a guarantee granted by an Italian guarantor is issued to guarantee
conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be
expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document,
such as the Indenture). In addition, as mentioned above, the guarantees granted by an Italian guarantor must be supported by
corporate benefit; in other words, the maximum guaranteed amount must be indicated in the guarantee and shall not exceed the
financial capabilities of the Italian guarantor. It has been held, that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant
guarantor’s assets. If such determination is deemed disproportional to the assets of the relevant Italian guarantor, there is the
risk that the guarantee could be declared void.

**_Limitations to the Guarantees and Collateral_**

In order to comply with the above corporate law requirements on, inter alia, corporate benefit and financial assistance,
the maximum amount that any guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy (if any) (the “Italian Guarantor”) may be
required to pay in respect of its obligations as guarantor under the relevant Guarantee will be subject to limitations. By virtue
of these limitations, the obligations of a guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy under its Guarantee may be significantly
less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or such Italian guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its
Guarantee.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the mandatory provisions of
Italian law in relation to (i) maximum interest rates (including the Italian Usury Law and article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code)
and (ii) capitalization of interests (including article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and article 120 of the Italian Legislative
Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993), the obligations of any of the Italian Guarantors under its Guarantee may not include
and may not be extended to (A) any interest qualifying as usurious pursuant the Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on
overdue amounts compounded in violation of the provisions set forth by article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and/or article
120 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 993, respectively.

**_Parallel Debt_**

Moreover, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a “parallel debt.” Pursuant to the parallel debt and
subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and to applicable law, the Security Agent, in its individual capacity acting
in its own name and not as agent or representative of the holders of the Notes, becomes the holder of a claim equal to each
amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. However, the parallel debt procedure included in the Intercreditor Agreement according to which the Guarantee is also granted in favor of the Security Agent, as beneficiary of parallel debt obligations
against the Issuer, which will be discharged to the extent the corresponding principal payment obligations of the Issuer under
the Intercreditor Agreement and the Notes are discharged - has not been tested in Italian courts, and there is no assurance that
it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed by Italian law.

**_Certain Additional Considerations in Relation to Granting Security Interests and Guarantees_**

Italian corporate law (Articles 2497-quinquies and 2467 of the Italian Civil Code) provides for rules to protect creditors
against “undercapitalized companies” and provides for remedies in respect thereof. In this respect, in case of a loan to a
company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination
powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person
or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata, such loan will be
subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when,


-----

taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness
compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan
(“undercapitalization”). Any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior to a
bankruptcy declaration would be required to be returned to the borrower. The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made
in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of
financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly.

As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above. Some of such
precedents have held that article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated as società per azioni,
hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are incorporated as società per azioni.

Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian courts may apply
such provisions of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s relationship with Italian subsidiaries under the relevant intercompany
loans. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the obligations of any Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loan
are subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should any of the obligations of any subsidiary under any
intercompany loan or note be deemed subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior
only to the equity, the Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under any intercompany loan or note granted to the Italian
subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes.

Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans or notes are
subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any Collateral created over such
intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees and/or security interests granted by such Italian subsidiaries (including the
Guarantees) may be impaired or restricted.

However, due to the COVID-19 emergency, the Italian Government issued the so-called “Decreto liquidità” (i.e., Law
Decree April 8, 2020, no. 23, published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on April 8, 2020 and converted in law by the Italian Parliament
by the Law June 5, 2020, no. 40, published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on June 6, 2020 the “Liquidity Decree”) according to
which pursuant to its article 8, the provisions summarized above are temporarily frozen and therefore loans granted by (i) a
person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing
company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the
case of a company incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata during the period between April 9, 2020 and
December 31, 2020 are exempted from the application of the so-called “equitable subordination” rule.

**_Certain Limitations on Enforcement_**

The enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be complex and time consuming, especially in a
liquidation scenario, given that Italian courts maintain a significant role in the enforcement process in comparison to other
jurisdictions with which the holders of the Notes may be familiar. The two primary goals of the Italian law are first, to maintain
employment, and second, to liquidate the debtor’s assets for the satisfaction of creditors. These competing goals often have
been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns (ramo d’azienda) and by ensuring that employees are transferred
along with the businesses being sold.

Under Italian law, in the event that the Italian Guarantor becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees given
by it by way of parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential challenges by the appointed bankruptcy receiver or by
other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness or avoidance or clawback of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on
the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the debtor during the suspect period. For a more detailed
explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of clawback actions in an insolvency scenario, see “—Certain Italian
_Insolvency Laws_ _Considerations—Bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento)” below. If challenged successfully, the guarantee may_
become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of the
guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts.

Furthermore, in the event that the limitations on the guarantee issued by an Italian Guarantor apply and/or there are
payment obligations under any Notes other than in respect of principal or interest, the holders of the Notes could have a reduced
claim against the relevant guarantor.

According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, guarantee and rights in general may be subject
to, among others, the following aspects:


-----

- the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed below relating to or affecting
the rights of creditors;

- an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement, precautionary measures or remedy, the
availability of which is subject to equitable consideration or which is otherwise at the discretion of the Court;

- with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive), each party can
refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer to perform its own obligation
thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Article 1460 of the Italian Civil Code;

- claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of Italian law
concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni e decadenze) or may be or become
subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim (including counterclaims related to
counterparties’ default (eccezione di inadempimento));

- pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations (compensazione),
persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for the correspondent amount when
both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation or fungible assets of the same kind and are
equally liquid, due and payable;

- where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter in its opinion,
Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such opinion is based on reasonable
grounds;

- the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be limited by
the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di applicazione necessaria) and by the fact that
the relevant provisions of foreign laws may be deemed contrary to Italian public policy principles and there is no
case law setting out specific criteria for the application of such legal concepts under Italian law;

- there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement or instrument,
whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or instrument to all intents and
purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would survive such judgment might not be held to
do so;

- enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del diritto);

- the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument may be subject
to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation pursuant to the provisions of
Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code;

- any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal, invalid, not
binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in order to save those other
provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the interpretation of intention of the parties,
taking also into account the conduct of the parties following the execution of such agreement or instrument
(Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code);

- an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for the purchase
or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the Italian Civil Code are satisfied;

- an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial obligations of its
parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such interest being determined by the
relevant company on a case-by-case basis;

- in case of bankruptcy, a receiver in bankruptcy is appointed by the court to administer the proceeding under the
supervision of the bankruptcy court and creditors’ committee and creditors cannot start or continue individual
foreclosure actions (including the enforcement of security interests) against the debtor (automatic stay).
Furthermore, the sale of the relevant pledged assets is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee is expressly
authorized by the bankruptcy court;


-----

     - in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment to the relevant
debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable date (data certa); the priority of
such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of ensuring that a document has an undisputable date
is that of ensuring that the execution of the relevant document by one of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary
who states the date of witnessing on the document;

     - there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning advance waivers
or forfeitures;

     - the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented by Italian law
in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct (dolo) or the violation of mandatory provisions;

     - penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court;

     - any obligation of an Italian company and/or any obligation secured or guaranteed by an Italian company, which
is in violation of certain Italian mandatory or public policy rules (including, among others, any obligation to pay:
(i) any portion of interest exceeding the thresholds of the interest rate permitted under the Italian law no. 108 of
March 7, 1996 (i.e., the Italian usury law), as amended from time to time and related implementing rules and
regulations; and (ii) any portion of interest deriving from any compounding of interest which does not comply
with Italian law, including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code, according to which, accrued and unpaid interest
can be capitalized only after legal proceedings to recover the debt were started or in the event the interest were
unpaid and capitalized for not less than six months based on an agreement executed after the relevant maturity
date and Article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree no. 385/1993 (i.e., the Italian Banking Act)) may not be
enforceable;

     - if a party to an agreement is aware of the invalidity of that agreement and does not inform the other parties to that
agreement of such invalidity, it is liable for the damages suffered by such other parties as a consequence of having
relied upon the validity of the agreement;

     - Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or litigation.

In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can be brought
by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a guarantee, security, agreement
and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to seek a claw-back action (azione revocatoria ordinaria)
pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code (which results in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of
the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit.
An Italian court could revoke the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment
of the prejudice, was to make the two following findings:

     - that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor, or, if such
act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently designed for the purpose
of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and

     - that, in the case of non-gratuitous acts, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if the act was
done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in the fraudulent design.

**_Certain Italian Insolvency Law Considerations_**

The insolvency laws of Italy may not be as favorable to investors’ interests as those of other jurisdictions with which
investors may be familiar. In Italy, courts play a central role in the insolvency process. Moreover, in court procedures may be
materially more complex and the enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be more time-consuming than in
equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which holders of the Notes may be familiar.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not include special
provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorized to carry out certain reserved activities nor it provides
a comprehensive description of insolvency laws application where publicly-owned companies are involved.


-----

Certain provisions of Italian law have been amended or have entered into force only recently and, therefore, may be
subject to further implementation and/or interpretations and have not been tested to date in the Italian courts. To this extent, it
shall be noted that Italian insolvency laws and regulations have recently been substantially reviewed and significant
amendments are expected in the near future. In particular, the Italian government approved on January 12, 2019 the Legislative
Decree No. 14 implementing the guidelines contained in Law No. 155 dated October 19, 2017 (the “Legislative Decree”),
which enacts a new comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, among others, insolvency matters (so-called “Code
_of Business Crisis and Insolvency,” hereinafter the “Insolvency Code”). Legislative Decree was published in the Gazzetta_
_Ufficiale on February 14, 2019 no. 38—Suppl._ _Ordinario no. 6. The main innovations introduced by the Insolvency Code_
include: (i) the elimination of the term “bankrupt” (fallito) due to its negative connotation and the replacement of bankruptcy
proceedings (fallimento) with a judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale); (ii) a new definition of “state of crisis”: (iii) the
adoption of the same procedural framework in order to ascertain such state of crisis and to access the different judicial
insolvency proceedings provided for by the same Insolvency Code; (iv) a new set of rules concerning group restructurings;
(v) restrictions to the use of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) in order to favor going
concern proceedings; (vi) a new preventive alert and mediation phase to avoid insolvency; (vii) jurisdiction of specialized
courts over proceedings involving large debtors; (viii) amendments to certain provisions of the Italian Civil Code aimed at
ensuring the general effectiveness of the reform. However, the main provisions set out in the Insolvency Code have not yet
come into force and, due to the COVID-19 emergency, the Liquidity Decree states that the date on which the Insolvency Code
will come into force is postponed to September 1, 2021 (whilst, according to the original provision of the Insolvency Code, it
should have come into force on August 15, 2020). Therefore, the practical consequences of its implementation and its potential
impact on the existing insolvency proceedings cannot to date be foreseen and significant amendments are expected in the near
future that may impact the provisions set forth therein. In light of the foregoing, and for the sake of clarity, the following
paragraphs will only focus on the Italian insolvency laws and regulations already applicable and into force as of the date hereof
(and will not take into account, therefore, the provisions of the Insolvency Code which will enter into force only on September
1, 2021).Certain provisions of Italian law have been amended or have entered into force only recently and, therefore, may be
subject to further implementation and/or interpretations and have not been tested to date in the Italian courts. In this respect,
without prejudice to the above-mentioned approval of the Insolvency Code, the most recent reforms that have been
implemented by the Italian government on the main Italian bankruptcy legislation as defined below are: (i) the reform approved
on June 23, 2015, through a Law Decree containing urgent reforms applicable, among others, to Italian bankruptcy law (the
“Decree”). The Decree entered into force in June 2015 (the date of its publication in the Gazzetta Ufficiale) and has been
converted into law by Italian Law No. 132 of August 6, 2015, entered into force on August 21, 2015 (the date after its
publication in the Gazzetta Ufficiale) and (ii) the amendments implemented by means of the adoption of (a) the Decree No. 59
of May 3, 2016, converted into law by Italian Law No. 119 of June 30, 2016, and (b) Italian Law No. 232 of December 11,
2016.

As a preliminary remark, it should be noted that the main Italian bankruptcy regulation is the Italian Royal Decree
No. 267 of March 16, 1942, as reformed and currently in force (the “Italian Bankruptcy Law”), The two primary aims of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the
satisfaction of creditors’ claims. On the other hand, other particular insolvency procedures, such as “Prodi-bis” extraordinary
administration procedure or “Marzano” extraordinary administration procedure, which will be addressed as well in the
following paragraphs, also target to the preservation of significant employment levels. These competing aims have often been
balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses
being sold. However, the Italian Bankruptcy Law has been recently amended with a view to promoting rescue procedures rather
than liquidation, focusing on the continuity and survival of financially distressed businesses and enhancing pre-bankruptcy
restructuring options. Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy (fallimento) must be declared by a court, based on the
insolvency (insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/or one or more
creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Article 5 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to
regularly meet its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent rather than a temporary status of insolvency, in order
for a court to hold that a company is insolvent.

In cases where a company is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, financial distress,
it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the
company, but which are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly
challenged as voidable transactions.

The following debt restructuring and bankruptcy alternatives are available under Italian law for companies in a state
of crisis and for insolvent companies.


-----

**_Restructuring Outside of a Judicial Process (Accordi Stragiudiziali)_**

Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it is more favorable for the debtor and
because informal arrangements put in place as a result of an out-of-court restructuring are vulnerable to being reviewed by a
court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions, and may trigger liabilities in
the event of a subsequent bankruptcy. However, in cases where a company is solvent, but facing financial difficulties, it may
be possible to enter into an out-of-court arrangement with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company.

**_Out-of-Court Reorganization Plans (Piani di Risanamento) Pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian_**
**_Bankruptcy Law_**

Out-of-court debt reorganization agreements are based on restructuring plans (piani di risanamento) prepared by
companies in order to restructure their indebtedness and to ensure the recovery of their financial condition. An independent
expert appointed directly by the debtor must verify the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business
data provided by the company. There is no need to obtain court approval to appoint the expert. The expert must possess certain
specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet the requirements set forth, among others, by Article 2399 of the
Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case of misrepresentation or false certification.

Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not under any form of judicial control or approval and, therefore, no
application is required to be filed with the court or supervising authority. Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not
required to be approved and consented to by a specific majority of all outstanding claims.

The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable but they may not be adopted to liquidate and dismiss the
business of the company, but shall provide for the restructuring of the debtor’s indebtedness and the rebalancing of the debtor’s
financial condition on a going concern basis. Unlike in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement proceedings and debt restructuring
agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans do not offer the debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or
precautionary actions of third-party creditors. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these plans fail and the debtor
be declared bankrupt, the payments and/or acts carried out, and/or security interest created as implementation of the certified
plan (a) are not subject to bankruptcy claw-back action; and (b) are exempted from the potential application of certain criminal
sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the Companies’ Register are needed (although publication in the
Companies’ Register is possible upon a debtor’s request and would allow to certain tax benefits), and, therefore, the risk of bad
publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement or a debt restructuring
agreement. Since the reorganization plan is not subject to any court approval or judicial review, it cannot be excluded that the
above-mentioned exemption effects may be challenged in the event of subsequent bankruptcy, if the competent court were to
assess that the reorganization plan was not feasible at the time it was certified by the independent expert.

**_Debt Restructuring Agreements with Creditors Pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (Accordi_**
**_di Ristrutturazione dei Debiti)_**

The debtor may execute with creditors holding claims representing at least 60% of the total amount of its indebtedness
a restructuring agreement subject to court’s approval (omologazione) pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.
An independent expert appointed by the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by
the company and declare that the restructuring agreement is feasible and that it ensures that the debts towards the nonparticipating creditors can be fully satisfied within the following terms: (a) 120 days from the date of approval of the agreement
by the court, in the case of debts which are due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the approval
(omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (b) 120 days from the date on which the relevant debts
fall due, in case of debts which are not yet due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the approval
(omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law,
only a debtor who is insolvent or in a situation of “financial distress” (i.e., facing financial crisis which does not yet amount to
insolvency) can initiate this process and request the court’s approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement entered
into with its creditors.

The agreement is published in the companies’ register and is effective as of the day of its publication. Starting from
the date of such publication and for 60 days thereafter, creditors cannot start or continue any conservative or enforcement action
against the assets of the debtor in relation to pre-existing receivables and cannot obtain any security interest (unless agreed) in
relation to preexisting debts. The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents
of the debt restructuring agreement. The restructuring agreement (and the underlying business and financial plan) can therefore
provide, among others, either for the continuation of the business by the debtor or by a third party, or for the sale of the business


-----

to a third party, and may provide for refinancing agreements, moratoria, write-offs and/or postponements of claims. The debt
restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

The 60-days stay of actions period can also be requested by the debtor to the court, pursuant to Article 182-bis,
Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, while negotiations with creditors are still pending (i.e., prior to the above-mentioned
publication of the agreement), subject to certain conditions. Such request for stay of actions must be published in the companies’
register and becomes effective as of the date of publication. The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation
filed by the debtor, sets the date for a hearing within 30 days of the publication and orders the debtor to supply to the creditors
the relevant documentation in relation to the stay of actions request. At such hearing, creditors and other interested parties may
file an opposition to the agreement and the court assesses whether the conditions for granting the stay of action are in place
and, in such case, orders that no interim relief or enforcement action may be started or continued, nor can security interests
(unless agreed) be acquired over the assets of the debtor, and sets a deadline (not exceeding 60 days) within which a debt
restructuring agreement and the assessment by the expert must be filed. Nevertheless, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,
Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree, provides, in relation to the proceeding for the approval (omologazione) of the debtrestructuring agreements under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law already pending as of February 23, 2020, that the
debtor which has already been granted such extension by the court, can, before the expiry of the deadline, request for a further
extension up to 90 days even if there is a petition for bankruptcy declaration pending against it. The petition requesting such
additional extension shall provide for the elements that make it necessary to grant the extension with specific reference to the
events that have occurred as a result of the COVID-19 epidemiological emergency. The court, after having obtained the opinion
of the judicial commissioner (if appointed), grants the extension when it considers that the application is based on real and
reasonable grounds (concreti e giustificati motivi).

The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same time frame, an application for
the court supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed,
without prejudice to the effect of the stay of actions.

Creditors and other interested parties may challenge the agreement within 30 days from the publication of the
agreement in the companies’ register. After having settled the challenges (if any) the court will validate the agreement by issuing
a decree, which can be appealed within 15 days of its publication.

The Italian Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015 introduced Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law, which provides certain specific provisions with respect to debt-restructuring agreement executed with financial creditors
(provided that certain conditions are met).

Pursuant to Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended by and
converted into law by Law 132/2015, debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness are
entitled to enter into debt restructuring agreements pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law providing for
different categories of financial creditors having analogous legal situation and economic interests. In such respect, provided
that financial creditors representing at least 75% of the aggregate financial claims of the relevant category are adhering to the
restructuring agreement, the debtor can ask the court to declare such agreement binding also on the dissenting financial creditors
belonging to the same category (so-called “cram down”), subject to certain conditions being met, including that treatment of
dissenting creditors is not worse than under any other available alternative and that all creditors (adhering and non-adhering)
have been informed about the negotiations and have been allowed to take part in them in good faith. If the abovementioned
conditions are met, then the remaining 25% (or lower percentage) of non-participating financial creditors belonging to the same
class of creditors are crammed down; however, crammed down creditors can challenge the deal and refuse to be forced into it,
on the basis of the lack of homogeneity of the classes of creditors. Pursuant to Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law, the debtor may also enter into a moratorium arrangement (convenzione di moratoria) with its creditors which are banks
and financial intermediaries by which also the non consenting banks and financial intermediaries are bound, provided that (i)
the adhering financial creditors represent at least 75% of that debtor’s aggregate financial indebtedness; (ii) non-adhering
creditors have been informed of the ongoing negotiations and have been allowed to participate to such negotiations in good
faith, and (iii) an independent expert meeting the requirements provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law certifies that the non-consenting banks and financial intermediaries have legal status and economic interests
similar to those of the banks and financial intermediaries which have agreed to the moratorium arrangement. The banks and
financial intermediaries which have not agreed to the moratorium arrangement may file an objection (opposizione) to it within
30 days of receipt of the application.

In no case the debt restructuring agreement provided for under article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or
the moratorium arrangement may impose on the non-adhering creditors, among others, the performance of new obligations,
the maintenance of the possibility to utilize the existing facilities or the granting of new facilities.


-----

Such debt restructuring agreements and standstill agreements will not affect the rights of non-financial creditors (e.g.,
trade creditors) who cannot be crammed down and must be paid within 120 days if not participating to a scheme.

Pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financing granted to the debtor pursuant to the approved
debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors) (concordato preventivo) ranks
super- senior status under Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law in case of subsequent bankruptcy (such status also applies
to financing granted by shareholders, but only up to 80% of such financing – unless the lender has become shareholder as
implementation of the debt-restructuring agreement under Article 182-bis or of the _concordato preventivo proceeding)._
Financing granted “in view of” (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for the approval (omologazione) of a debt restructuring
agreement under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a court- supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with
creditors may be granted such super-senior status under Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law provided that it is envisaged
by the relevant plan or agreement and that such status is expressly recognized by the court in the context of the sanctioning
(omologazione) of the agreement or the approval of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo)
The same provisions apply to financings granted by shareholders up to 80% of their amount (unless the lender has become
shareholder as implementation of the debt-restructuring agreement under Article 182-bis or of the concordato preventivo
proceeding).

Moreover, pursuant to Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the Court, pending the approval
(omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or
after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a
petition pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (in relation to the court supervised pre-bankruptcy
arrangement with creditors procedure described below) may authorize the debtor, if so expressly requested: (i) to incur in new
super senior indebtedness and to secure such indebtedness with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims by way
of security, provided that the expert appointed by the debtor (which shall be in possession of certain requirements), having
verified the overall financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione), declares that the new financing aims
at providing a better satisfaction of the rights of the creditors, and (ii) to pay pre-existing debts deriving from the supply of
services or goods, to the extent already payable and due, provided that the expert declares that such payment is essential for the
keeping of the company’s activities and to ensure the best satisfaction for all creditors.

The provision of Article 182-quinques of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both debt restructuring agreement and
to the court-supervised pre-bankruptcy compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo) outlined below.

Furthermore, according to Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, pending the approval (omologazione)
of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182- bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing
of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a petition pursuant to
Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter
(e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court may also authorize the debtor to incur in new super senior (so-called prededucibile)
and urgent financial indebtedness, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business. The company,
while filing such request of authorization, is required to specify (i) the purpose of the financing; (ii) that it is unable to otherwise
obtain the required funds and (iii) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the
company. Such authorization request can also be filed in relation to maintaining short-term facilities (linee di credito
_autoliquidanti) already in place as of the filing date._

**_Court Supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (Concordato Preventivo)_**

A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis (i.e., financial distress which does not yet amount to
insolvency) and that has not been declared insolvent by the court has the option to make a composition proposal to its creditors,
under court supervision, in order to compose its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its business, thereby avoiding a
declaration of insolvency and the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. Such composition proposal can be made by a
commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate
amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate
amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness (including debts not
yet due) in excess of €0.5 million. Only the debtor company can initially file a petition with the court for a _concordato_
_preventivo (together with, among others, a restructuring plan and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the_
composition proposal and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company). The petition for
_concordato preventivo is then published in the company’s register by the registry of the court. From the date of such publication_
to the date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo, all enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors
(whose claims arose prior to the publication of the petition for concordato preventivo in the company’s register) are stayed.
According to prevailing case law of the Italian Supreme Court (absent any specific provisions of law in such respect),


-----

bankruptcy petitions filed both before and after the opening of the concordato preventivo procedure are frozen throughout the
procedure to the extent that the concordato procedure is and remains feasible, and subsequently dismissed in the event of
ratification (omologazione) of the concordato preventivo by the court. Preexisting creditors cannot obtain security interests
(unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the
concordato preventivo is published in the company’s register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors.

The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for, inter alia: (i) the restructuring and
payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it will ensure payment of at least 20% of
the unsecured receivables, except for the case of pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors with continuity of the going
concern (concordato con continuità aziendale) pursuant to Article 186-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, including through
extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds
(including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver
(assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into classes;
and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed
tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

The filing of the petition for concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary petition for a
_concordato preventivo (so-called concordato in bianco, pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as_
amended by Italian Law Decree No. 69/2013 as converted into Italian Law No. 98/2013 (“Law Decree 69/2013”)). The debtor
may file such petition along with: (i) its financial statements from the latest three financial years; and (ii) the list of creditors
with the reference to the amount of their respective receivables, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal
and all relevant documentation within a period assigned by the court between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing of the
preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for
such extension (giustificati motivi).

Nevertheless, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree, provides, in relation to
_concordato preventivo proceedings already pending as of February 23, 2020,_ that the debtor which has already been granted
such extension by the Court, can, before the expiry of the deadline, request for a further extension up to 90 days even if there
is a petition for bankruptcy declaration pending against it. The petition requesting such additional extension shall provide for
the elements that make it necessary to grant the extension with specific reference to the events that have occurred as a result of
the COVID-19 epidemiological emergency. The Court, after having obtained the opinion of the judicial commissioner (if
appointed), grants the extension when it considers that the application is based on real and reasonable grounds (concreti e
_giustificati motivi)._

In advance of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the approval of a debt restructuring agreement
(pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law).

If the court accepts such preliminary petition, it may: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to
overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 173 of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of nonexistent liabilities
or commission of other fraudulent acts), will report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may reject the petition for
_concordato preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting and information duties of the company during the abovementioned period._
The statutory provisions providing for the stay of enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors referred to in respect
of the concordato preventivo also apply to preliminary petitions for concordato preventivo (so-called concordato in bianco).

The debtor company may not file such pre-application where it had already done so in the previous two years without
the admission to the _concordato preventivo having followed. The decree setting the term for the presentation of the_
documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to the financial management of the company
and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the application and the restructuring plan) that the company has
to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor company will file, on a
monthly basis, its financial position, which is published, the following day, in the company’s register.

Noncompliance with these requirements results in the petition for concordato preventivo being declared inadmissible
and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are met, in the declaration
of bankruptcy of the distressed company. If the activities carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inadequate for
the preparation of the concordato preventivo proposal and the restructuring plan, the court may, ex officio, after hearing the
debtor and—if appointed—the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents.


-----

Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the pre-bankruptcy composition
with creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the court’s
authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent they are urgent.

Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company after the filing of concordato preventivo
petition (including preliminary petition) and new super senior indebtedness authorized by the court, pending the approval
(omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or
after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after
the filing of a concordato preventivo petition (including a preliminary petition under article 161 para. 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law), aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business, are treated as super-senior (so-called
_prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the related acts, payments and security interests_
granted are exempted from the claw-back actions provided under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The concordato preventivo proposal may provide, inter alia, that: (i) the debtor’s company’s business continues to be
run by the debtor’s company as a going concern; or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more companies and any assets
which are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated (concordato con continuità aziendale). In these cases, the plan
and petition for the concordato preventivo should fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence of
the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The
report of the independent expert must also certify that the continuation of the business is conducive to the satisfaction of
creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition proposal was not implemented. Furthermore, the going concernbased arrangements with creditors can provide for, among others, the disposal of those assets that are not functional to the
continuation of the business. The concordato preventivo plan and proposal may also provide for, inter alia, a proposed tax
settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato) to supervise
the procedure, appoints one or more judicial commissioners (commissari giudiziali) and calls the creditors’ meeting. During
the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its corporate bodies (usually its board
of directors), but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge (who will authorize all transactions that exceed the
ordinary course of business). The debtor is allowed to carry out urgent extraordinary transactions only upon the prior court’s
authorization, while ordinary transactions may be carried out without authorization. Third-party claims, related to the interim
acts legally carried out by the debtor, are super-senior (so-called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law.

Pursuant to article 169-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the debtor may request the competent court to be authorized
to terminate pending agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente eseguiti), except for certain agreements
which are excluded from the scope of the above provision (e.g., employment agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato),
certain real estate preliminary sale agreements and real estate lease agreements (contratti di locazione di immobili)). The request
may be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the petition for concordato preventivo or to the judge (giudice
_delegato), if the application is made after admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending agreements can_
also be suspended for a period of time not exceeding 60 days, renewable just once. In such circumstances, the other party has
the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such
indemnification is treated as a receivable preceding the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo).

The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved with the favorable vote of (a) the
creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote; and, in the event that the plan provides for more classes
of creditors, also by (b) the majority of the classes. The pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors is approved only if the
required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of the proposal. Creditors who did not exercise their voting rights in
the creditors’ meeting can do so (even via email) within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting and,
after such term, creditors who did not exercise their voting right will be deemed not to approve the concordato preventivo
proposal. In relation to voting by the holder of the Notes in the concordato preventivo proceeding, the interaction between
(i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and
the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum
and majorities in meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies is untested in the Italian courts. Secured creditors
are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the
_concordato preventivo proposal provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of their claim (provided that they receive,_
at least, an amount equal to the fair market value of their secured assets, as assessed by an independent expert). In such latter
case, they can vote only in respect of the part of their claim affected by the proposal. The court may also approve the concordato
_preventivo (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved_
it; and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the dissenting creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared


-----

to other solutions. If an objection to the implementation of the concordato _preventivo is filed by 20% of the creditors or, in case_
there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a dissenting class, entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless
approve the concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as
a result of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case. The court approves the concordato preventivo even
without the vote of the tax authority or the social contribution entities (enti gestori di forme di previdenza o assistenza
_obbligatorie) when their accession is decisive for the purposes of achieving the majorities referred to in Article 177 of the_
Italian Bankruptcy Law and when, also on the basis of the results of the report by the independent expert referred to in Article
161, Paragraph 3 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the proposal to satisfy the aforesaid authorities and entities is convenient
compared to the liquidation alternative.

Creditors (except for individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at
least 10% of the aggregate claims against the debtor can present a plan alternative to the debtor’s plan in the pre-bankruptcy
composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular, that the
proposal of the debtor does not ensure recovery of at least (i) 40% of the unsecured claims (crediti _chirografari) in case of pre-_
bankruptcy composition with creditors with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio), or (ii) 30% of the unsecured claims
(crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors based on the continuation of the going concern
(concordato con continuità aziendale).

In addition, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, a pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors
with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e., a pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors aiming at the sale of all
the assets in the interest of the creditors under the supervision of the judicial commissioner) must ensure that the unsecured
creditors are paid in a percentage of at least 20% of their claims.

This provision does not apply to pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors proposal based on the continuation of the
going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale).

To the extent the alternative plan is approved by the creditors and ratified (omologato), the court may grant special
powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including the power to take all
corporate actions required.

In addition, Article 163-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law
132/2015, provides that, if a plan in a pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), pursuant to Article
161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, includes an offer for the sale of the debtor’s assets or of a going
concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the Court must open a competitive bidding process.

After the approval by the creditors’ meeting, the court (having settled possible objections raised by the dissenting
creditors, if any) confirms the concordato preventivo proposal by issuing a confirmation order. If the creditors’ meeting does
not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request of the public prosecutor or a creditor, and having decided
that the appropriate conditions apply, declare the company bankrupt.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree, the deadlines for the fulfilment
of concordati preventivi and the ratified debt restructuring agreements (accordi di ristrutturazione omologati) expiring after
February 23, 2020 were extended by six months. Moreover, Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree also provides for: (i) upon certain
circumstances, the possibility to request a deadline to the court in order to file a new plan and new proposal to creditors, in
order to supersede the previous ones; (ii) in relation to a petition for concordato preventivo and/or a debt restructuring
agreements under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law filed up until December 31, 2021, the right of the debtor to
file, within December 31, 2021, a deed of renunciation (atto di rinuncia) whereby it declares that it has prepared and published
in the competent companies’ register a reorganization plan under Article 67, Paragraph 3, letter (d) of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law and provides evidence of the publication thereof.

**_Bankruptcy Proceedings (Fallimento)_**

A request to declare a debtor bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) for the judicial
liquidation of its assets can be filed by the debtor, any of its creditors and, in certain cases, the public prosecutor when a debtor
is insolvent. Insolvency, as defined under Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its
obligations with ordinary means as they come due. Bankruptcy is declared by the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian
Bankruptcy Law is applicable only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori _commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are_
met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three


-----

preceding fiscal years; (ii) has had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the
three preceding fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness (including debts not yet due) in excess of €0.5 million.

Bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a deputy judge (giudice delegato), a court-appointed
bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a representative of any
one of the creditors, and is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor to the satisfaction of creditors as a whole.
The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority.

Upon the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, amongst other things:

     - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed and creditors must file claims within a defined
period;

     - under certain circumstances secured creditors may enforce the security interests granted in relation to their claims
as soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of liquidation
of the secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject to any relevant expenses. In case the sale
price is not high enough to determine a full satisfaction of their credits, any outstanding balance will be considered
unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. Secured creditors may sell the
secured asset only with the court authorization. After hearing the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare) and
the creditors’ committee, the court decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the relevant timing in its
decision;

     - the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are transferred to the bankruptcy receiver
(curatore fallimentare);

     - continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater damage to the
company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to creditors;

     - any act (including payments, pledges, and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor (other than those made by
through the receiver) after (and in certain cases even before for a limited period of time) the declaration of
bankruptcy, becomes (or could become, if made before) ineffective against creditors; and

     - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy declaration are
suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over.

In order to overcome the uncertainty that may predictably arise, the contractual counterparty may file a written petition
requiring the court to give the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare) a deadline of no more than 60 days, within which
the bankruptcy receiver must decide whether to enter into the pending agreement or withdraw from it. Upon expiration of the
deadline without the receiver having replied to the counterparty’s request, the agreement is deemed terminated. Although the
general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations have not been
performed, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets
include real estate properties. In this respect, Law 132/2015 amended the relevant provision of the Italian Bankruptcy Law
which sets forth the requirements applicable to the liquidation procedure and, as a consequence, the timing for the liquidation
of the debtor’s assets is shortened. Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for priority of payment to certain preferential creditors,
including employees, the Italian treasury, and judicial and social authorities. Such priority of payment is provided under
mandatory provisions of law (as a consequence it is untested and it is unlikely that priority of payments such as those commonly
provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements would be recognized by an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are
inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). Unsecured creditors are satisfied after payment of preferential and secured
creditors, out of available funds and assets (if any) as below indicated.

    - **Bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato fallimentare). Bankruptcy proceedings can terminate**
prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors. The relevant petition can be filed
by one or more creditors or third parties starting from the declaration of bankruptcy, whereas the debtor or its
subsidiaries are permitted to file such a proposal only after one year following such declaration but within two
years from the decree giving effectiveness to the liabilities account (stato passivo). Secured creditors are not
entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato _fallimentare, unless and to the extent they waive their security or_


-----

the concordato fallimentare proposal provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of their claim (provided
that they receive, at least, an amount equal to the fair market value of their secured assets, as assessed by an
independent expert). In such latter case they can vote only in respect of the part of their claim affected by the
proposal. The petition may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different
treatments among the classes), and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner. The _concordato_
_fallimentare proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the creditors holding the majority (by_
value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, also by a majority (by value) of the claims in a majority of the classes).
Final court ratification is also required.

    - **Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may be**
different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU jurisdictions. Article
111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the
following order: (i) for payments of “predeductible” (i.e. super senior) claims (including, inter alia, claims
originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims which
are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. Under
Italian law, the highest priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are paid) are the claims of preferential
creditors, including the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators, and claims for
employee wages. The remaining priorities of claims are, in order of priority, those related to secured creditors
(creditori privilegiati; a preference in payment in most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law),
mortgages (creditori ipotecari), pledges (creditori prignoratizi) and, lastly, unsecured creditors (crediti
_chirografari). Under Italian law, the proceeds from the sale of the bankrupt’s estate are distributed according to_
legal rules of priority. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from these priority rules by proposing their
own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles (as
a consequence, it must be noted that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor
contractual agreements may not be enforceable against Italian bankruptcy estate to the event they are inconsistent
with the priorities provided by law). The law creates a hierarchy of claims that must be adhered to when
distributing the proceeds derived from the sale of the entire bankrupt’s estate or part thereof, or of a single asset.

    - **Avoidance powers in insolvency. Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back” or avoidance**
provisions under Italian law that may give rise, among others, to the revocation of payments made or security
interests granted by the debtor prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. The key avoidance provisions address
transactions made below market value, preferential transactions and transactions made with a view to defraud
creditors. Claw-back rules under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver
in bankruptcy compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions.

In bankruptcy proceedings, depending on the circumstances, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back
period of up to one year (six months in certain circumstances) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other
transactions. Please note that in the context of extraordinary administration procedures (as described below), in relation to
certain transactions, the claw-back period can be extended up to three or five years in certain circumstances. The Italian
Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or transactions which are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions
which are voidable at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner, as detailed below.

    - **Acts ineffective by operation of law. (i) Under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain**
limited exception, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered
into by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. Any asset subject to a
transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law becomes part of the
bankruptcy estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the declaration of bankruptcy, without
need to wait that the ineffectiveness of the transaction is sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may
challenge the registration before the delegated judge for violation of law; and (ii) under Article 65 of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are
deemed ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity within the two-year period prior to the
insolvency declaration.

     - Acts that could be declared ineffective at the request of the bankruptcy receiver / court commissioner.

a. The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be
clawed back (revocati) vis-à-vis the bankruptcy as provided for by Article 67 of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law and be declared ineffective, unless the non-insolvent party proves that it had no


-----

actual or constructive knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered
into:

i. onerous transactions entered into in the year before the insolvency declaration, when the
value of the debt or the obligations undertaken by the bankrupt entity exceeds 25% of the
value of the consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor;

ii. payments of debts, due and payable, which were not made by the debtor in cash or by other
customary means of payment in the year prior to the insolvency declaration;

iii. pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the year prior to the insolvency
declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which were not yet due at the time when
the new security was granted; and

iv. pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the six months prior to the
insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which had already fallen due
at the time when the new security was granted.

b. The following acts and transactions, if made during the period specified below, may be clawed back
(revocati) and declared ineffective if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the non-insolvent party
knew that the bankrupt entity was insolvent at the time of the act or transaction:

i. payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions
entered into or made within six months prior to the insolvency declaration; and

ii. granting of security interest for debts, simultaneously created, incurred in the six months
prior to the insolvency declaration.

c. The following transactions are exempted from claw-back actions:

i. payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market
practice;

ii. a remittance on a bank account; provided that it does not materially and permanently reduce
the bankrupt entity’s debt towards the bank;

iii. the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the
Italian Civil Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a residential
property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family
(within three degrees of kinship) or a non-residential property that is intended as the main
seat of the enterprise of the purchaser; provided that, as at the date of the insolvency
declaration, the activity is actually exercised therein or the investments for the
commencement of such activity have been carried out therein;

iv. transactions entered into, payments made and guarantees and security interests granted by
the debtor pursuant to a plan (piano attestato) under Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law; (see “—Out of Court Reorganization Plans (Piani di Risanamento)
_Pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law” above);_

v. a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee and security interest granted in the
context of a homologated “concordato preventivo” under Article 161 of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law (see “—Court Supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors
_(Concordato Preventivo)” above) or an homologated “accordo di ristrutturazione del_
debito” under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (see “—Debt Restructuring
_Agreements with Creditors Pursuant to Article 182 bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law_
_(Accordi di Ristrutturazione dei Debiti)” above), as well as any transactions, payment,_
security interests and/or guarantees carried out after the filing of a petition for concordato
preventivo (see above);


-----

vi. remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants concerning
work carried out by them; and

vii. payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect
to services necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedures.

In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the bankrupt entity be
declared ineffective vis-à-vis the acting creditors within the ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria),
provided under Article 2901 of the Italian Royal Decree No 262 of March 16, 1942 (the “Italian Civil Code”). According to
Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions through which the bankrupt entity disposed of
its assets prejudicially to such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided that the debtor
(now bankrupt) was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was
originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the debtor (now bankrupt) for the purpose of prejudicing such
creditor’s right) and that, in case of transactions entered into for consideration with a third party, the third party was aware of
such prejudice (and, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third party
participated in the fraudulent scheme). The burden of proof is entirely with the receiver.

Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis of the Italian Civil Code, providing for a “simplified” claw-back
action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered)
assets from attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets
without previously obtaining a court decision clawing back/ nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that
such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as
trusts or the so-called fondo patrimoniale or “family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be
carried out by the creditor against the third-party purchaser.

**_Extraordinary Administration for Large Insolvent Companies (Amministrazione Straordinaria delle Grandi_**
**_Imprese in Stato di Insolvenza)_**

The extraordinary administration procedure is available under Italian Legislative Decree no. 270 of 1999 (so called
“Prodi-bis”) for large industrial and commercial enterprises; this procedure is commonly referred to as the “Prodi-bis
_procedure.” To be eligible, a company must be insolvent although able to demonstrate serious recovery prospects, have_
employed at least 200 employees in the year preceding the commencement of the procedure, and have debts equal to at least
two-thirds of its assets as shown in its financial statements and two-thirds of its income deriving from sales and services during
its last financial year. The procedure may be commenced by petition of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the public prosecutor.
The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to an
extraordinary administration proceeding. Preferential payment is granted to those credits (even unsecured) accrued to allow the
conduct of the company’s business activity. Extraordinary administration procedures involve two main phases—a judicial
phase and an administrative phase.

In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria and whether it is
insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three judicial commissioners (commissari giudiziali) to
investigate whether there are serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or reorganization. The judicial commissioners
submit(s) a report to the court (within 30 days) together with an opinion from the Italian Ministry of Economic Development
(the “Ministry”). The court has 30 days to decide whether to admit the company to the procedure or place it into bankruptcy.

If the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the administrative phase begins and the
extraordinary commissioner(s) appointed by the Ministry prepare a restructuring plan. The plan can provide either for the sale
of the business as a going concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Disposal Plan”) or for a
reorganization leading to the company’s economic and financial recovery within two years (unless extended by the Ministry)
(the “Recovery Plan”). It may also include a composition with creditors (concordato). The plan must be approved by the
Ministry within 30 days from submission by the extraordinary commissioner(s). In addition, the extraordinary commissioner
draws up a report every six months on the financial condition and interim management of the company and sends it to the
Ministry. The procedure ends upon successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan; however, should either
plan fail, the company will be declared bankrupt. If the Disposal Plan is approved, the extraordinary commissioner(s) can
initiate claw-back actions according to the avoidance provisions set forth with respect to bankruptcy proceedings. If acts such
as those that could be declared ineffective at the request of the bankruptcy receiver (see above) are put in place among
companies belonging to the same group, the claw-back period is extended to up to three or five years.


-----

**_Industrial Restructuring of Large Insolvent Companies (Ristrutturazione Industriale di Grandi Imprese in Stato_**
**_di Insolvenza)_**

Introduced in 2003 pursuant to Italian Law Decree No. 347 of December 23, 2003, as converted into Italian Law
No. 39 of 2004 and subsequently amended, this procedure is also known as the “Marzano procedure.” It is complementary to
the Prodi-bis procedure and, except as otherwise provided, the same provisions apply. The Marzano procedure is intended to
work faster than the Prodi-bis procedure. For example, although a company must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry
can be made before the court commences the administrative phase.

The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis, have at least 500
employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of debt (including those from outstanding
guarantees). The decision whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry following the debtor’s request (who
must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry assesses whether the relevant requirements are
met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will manage the company. The court also decides on the
company’s insolvency.

The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to submit a Disposal
Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be completed within,
respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal or Recovery Plan is approved by the Ministry,
the court will declare the company bankrupt and open bankruptcy proceedings.

Unlike in the Prodi-bis procedure, in the Marzano procedure the extraordinary commissioner(s) can initiate claw-back
actions also if a Recovery Plan is approved, provided that this results in a material benefit for the creditors.

**_Compulsory Administrative Winding-Up (Liquidazione Coatta Amministrativa)_**

A compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa) is only available for public interest
entities such as state-controlled companies, insurance companies, credit institutions and other financial institutions, none of
which can be wound up pursuant to bankruptcy proceedings. It is irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or
the private sector. A compulsory administrative winding-up is special type of insolvency proceedings in which the entity is
liquidated not by the bankruptcy court but by the relevant administrative authority that oversees the industry in which the entity
is active. The procedure may be triggered not only by the insolvency of the relevant entity, but also by other grounds expressly
provided for by the relevant legal provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management
of the bank or serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions).

The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario liquidatore) is
appointed to wind up the company. The liquidator’s actions are monitored by a steering committee (comitato di sorveglianza).
The powers assigned to the designated judge and the bankruptcy court under the other insolvency proceedings are assumed by
the relevant administrative authority under this procedure. The effect of the forced administrative winding-up on creditors is
largely the same as under bankruptcy proceedings and includes, for example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules
set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to a compulsory
administrative winding-up.

**_Interim Financing_**

The Decree 83/2015, as amended and converted into law by Law 132/2015, introduced, by means of the already
described Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the possibility for debtors to also obtain authorization to receive
urgent interim financing and to continue to use existing trade receivables credit lines (linee di credito autoliquidanti) necessary
for their business needs before a court’s approval of a pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) or
the entry into a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) with priority status (prededucibilità) in
case of subsequent bankruptcy without the expert certification and through an accelerated review process by the relevant court,
upon, among others, the relevant debtor’s declaration that interim finance is urgently needed and the debtor’s inability to access
such finance would cause imminent and irreparable damage. The court must decide on the request within 10 days of the filing
of the application after consultation with the judicial commissioner and, if deemed necessary, the principal creditors.

**_Hardening Period/Clawback and Fraudulent Transfer_**

Under Italian law, transactions potentially subject to avoidance also include those contemplated by a Guarantee or the
granting of security interests under the security documents by a guarantor and/or security provider.


-----

In the event that the relevant guarantor of the Notes and/or security provider thereof enters into an insolvency
proceeding, the security interests created under the documents entered into to secure the Collateral and any future security
interests or guarantees could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of such
guarantor and/or security provider under the rules of avoidance or claw-back as already described above.

If the challenges are successful, the rights granted under the guarantees or in connection with security interests under
the relevant security documents may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate.
To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest
and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents.

Lastly, as noted above, the Recast Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various
national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European Union, as well as and
within the United Kingdom with respect to the insolvency proceedings opened before the end of the “implementation period”
under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union.

**Spain**

**_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees_**

Under Spanish law, personal claims may become time barred (5 years since the obligation becomes enforceable being
the general term established for obligations in personam under article 1,964 of the Spanish Civil Code, as amended by Act
42/2015, of October 5, 2015) or may be or become subject to the defense of set-off or counterclaim. In addition, article 1,851
of the Spanish Civil Code establishes that an extension granted to a debtor by a creditor without the consent of the guarantor
extinguishes the personal guarantee (in the sense that it is limited to the original term, although case law has established
exceptions where the extension benefits both the debtor and the guarantor).

In general terms, under Spanish law, any guarantee or security interest must guarantee or secure a primary obligation
to which it is ancillary. The primary obligation must be clearly identified in the guarantee or security agreement, and the nullity
or termination of the primary obligation entails the nullity or termination of the ancillary guarantee or security interest.
Consequently, if the primary obligation is terminated, the ancillary guarantee or security interest will also be deemed null and
void. In the event that the guarantor or security provider is able to prove that there are no existing and valid guaranteed or
secured obligations, Spanish courts may consider that the guarantor or security provider’s obligations under the relevant
guarantee or security agreement are not enforceable. The enforcement of guarantees may be limited since the guarantor may
not be required to pay any amount in excess of the amount owed by the principal debtor or under conditions that are less
favorable than those applying to the principal debtor. In addition, a guarantee or security interest may not be enforced in Spain
without having validly accelerated (totally or partially, as applicable) the underlying agreements governing the guaranteed or
secured obligations, and may be affected by any amendment, supplement, waiver, repayment, novation or extinction of the
secured obligations.

A Spanish court may not accept acceleration (vencimiento anticipado) of an agreement if the default were of minimal
importance (incumplimiento no esencial). To be recognized by the Spanish courts as giving rise to the remedy of acceleration,
a default must be material. The decision to accelerate an agreement must be based on objective facts and cannot be left to the
sole discretion of one party as this would not be permitted by article 1,256 of the Spanish Civil Code.

Moreover, Spanish law may limit the ability of a Spanish Guarantor to guarantee the Notes or to grant security interests
over its assets to secure the Notes. Recent Spanish rulings which do not constitute settled case law indicate, and certain scholars
understand, that risk associated with a guarantee or the value of a security interest provided by a Spanish company to guarantee
or secure indebtedness held by other companies within its corporate group must be reasonable and economically and
operationally justified from the Spanish company’s perspective and justified under the corporate interest of such company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, there are rulings from the Spanish Supreme Court recognizing the validity of upstream
guarantees, specially were granted as an esencial element of the relevant financing which is guaranteed.

Furthermore, the obligations of the Spanish Guarantor under its Guarantee or under any security instrument granted
by it cannot extend to any obligation which, if incurred, would constitute a breach of the Spanish financial assistance rules.
Pursuant to these rules, the obligations of the Spanish Guarantor under the Guarantee or any security granted or executed by it:

     - shall not extend to any use of the proceeds of the Notes for the purpose of acquiring shares representing the share
capital of the Spanish Guarantor or shares representing the share capital of its direct or indirect parent company,


-----

or refinancing a previous debt incurred for the acquisition of shares representing the share capital of the Spanish
Guarantor or shares representing the share capital of its direct or indirect parent company; and

     - shall be deemed not to be undertaken or incurred by the Spanish Guarantor to the extent that the same would
constitute unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of article 150 (for Spanish public limited companies
(sociedades anónimas)) or article 143 (for the Spanish private limited liability companies (sociedades de
_responsabilidad limitada) of the Spanish Companies Royal Decree-Law 1/2010, July 2(Ley de Sociedades de_
_Capital) (the “Spanish Capital Companies Act”) and, in that case, all provisions of such Guarantee or security_
shall be construed accordingly in the sense that in no case can any Guarantee or security given by the Spanish
Guarantor provides any such unlawful financial assistance.

In particular, Spanish law prohibits financial assistance (i) for public limited liability companies (sociedades anónimas
(S.A.)) in relation to the acquisition of their own shares or the shares of any direct or indirect parent company and (ii) for private
limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada (S.L.)), in relation to the acquisition of their own shares
and the shares of any member of their corporate group. Therefore, Spanish law governed guarantees or security interests granted
or assumed by subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of Spain shall not extend to any payment obligation incurred by the
Issuer for the purpose of acquiring the shares of such Spanish subsidiary or the shares of its direct or indirect parent company
or, as applicable, any member of their group, to the extent that such security interest would constitute unlawful financial
assistance within the meaning of Article 150 and 143 of Spanish Decree 1/2010 dated July 2 on Spanish Corporations (Ley de
_Sociedades de Capital). This limitation may also apply to the refinancing of acquisition debt, although this is widely debated_
between academics. Accordingly, any guarantee or security interest granted by any Spanish subsidiary shall not apply to the
extent the proceeds are used to repay existing indebtedness of the Issuer if such existing indebtedness was used for the purposes
described above. No whitewash procedures are available. Accordingly, the guarantee granted by any Spanish company will be
limited by the amount of the funds that are not used for unlawful financial assistance purposes.

For the purposes of the paragraphs above, a reference to a “holding company” or “parent company” of a Guarantor
shall mean the company which, directly or indirectly, owns the majority of the voting rights of such Guarantor or that may have
a dominant influence on such Guarantor. It shall be presumed that one company has a dominant influence on another company
when (i) any of the scenarios set out in section 1 of article 42 of the Spanish Commercial Code (Código de Comercio) are met
or (ii) when at least half plus one of the members of the managing body of the Spanish Guarantor are also members of the
managing body or top managers (altos directivos) of the dominant company or of another company controlled by such dominant
company.

In addition, a reference to the “group” of the Spanish Guarantor shall mean the group of companies that have in
common the same holding company (as this term is described above).

Under Spanish law there are some provisions on capitalization which have to be taken into account when guarantees
are enforced. For example, when the enforcement of the guarantee causes the amount of the relevant Spanish subsidiary net
equity (patrimonio neto) to fall below half of its share capital, the Spanish subsidiary will need to be wound up (disolverse),
unless its share capital is increased or decreased in the required amount to reestablish the balance between its net equity and its
share capital and provided that it is not required to declare its insolvency.

In addition, and while this remains a matter debated between Spanish scholars, it is possible that certain defenses
available to the Spanish Guarantor relating to corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, capital
preservation or thin capitalization may limit the amount guaranteed under the Guarantee by reference to the net assets and share
capital of the Spanish Guarantor and the amount secured under the relevant security agreement by reference to the value of the
collateral.

Under the Spanish Capital Companies Act, Spanish companies (both public limited liability companies (sociedades
_anónimas (S.A.)) and private limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada (S.L.))) may issue and_
guarantee (or provide security for) numbered series of notes and other securities that recognize or create debt, with certain
restrictions applicable to limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada (S.L.)). In particular, pursuant to
Section 401 of the Spanish Companies Act, the Guarantee provided by the Spanish Guarantor incorporated under the form of
limited liability companies (“sociedades de responsabilidad limitada” or “S.L.s”), is subject to the following restrictions: (a)
S.L.s can only issue and guarantee notes up to an aggregate maximum amount of twice its own equity (recursos propios), unless
the issue is secured by a mortgage, a pledge of securities, a public guarantee or a joint guarantee from a credit institution S.L.s
are prohibited to issue or guarantee (or provide security for) notes convertible into quota shares (participaciones sociales).


-----

In respect of the restrictions applicable to limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada (S.L.)),
there is no consistent opinion among scholars and practitioners yet nor case law regarding the interpretation of Section 401 of
the Spanish Capital Companies Act.

The terms “enforceable,” “enforceability,” “valid,” “legal,” “binding” and “effective” (or any combination thereof)
mean that all of the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant documents are of a type enforced by Spanish
courts; the terms do not mean that these obligations will necessarily be enforced in all circumstances in accordance with their
terms. Enforcement before the courts will in any event be subject to:

     - the nature of the remedies available in the courts;

     - Spanish public policy (overriding mandatory provisions); and

     - the availability of defenses such as (without limitation) set-off (unless validly waived), circumvention of law
(fraude de ley), abuse in the exercise of rights (abuso de derecho), misrepresentation, force majeure, unforeseen
circumstances, undue influence, duress, abatement and counterclaim.

Without, among others, notarization of the security documents, the secured parties will not have access to the executive
summary proceedings (juicio ejecutivo) in case of judicial enforcement of the security documents in Spain, having the secured
parties to follow necessarily the ordinary judicial proceedings (juicio ordinario).

Additionally, the Spanish Capital Companies Act foresees a pre-emption right in favour of the shareholders in the
context of enforcement proceedings. In particular, in the case of Spanish private limited companies (sociedades de
_responsabilidad limitada), if not exercised by the quotaholders, such pre-emption right is granted to the company provided that_
it has been expressly foreseen in its by-laws. This may disincentive potential bidders to participate in execution proceedings of
pledges of this type of securities.

**_Parallel Debt_**

Parallel debt structures are not contemplated under Spanish law and we are not aware of any precedent of a Spanish
court reviewing a parallel debt structure. Spanish law requires that, to be valid and enforceable, all contracts and obligations to
be assumed because of a valid and licit ground (causa) (Section 1,261 of the Spanish Civil Code) and therefore, the validity
and enforceability of abstract obligations or any obligation assumed without a valid and licit ground (causa) may be rejected.

Therefore we cannot assure that by creating any such structure it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability
by the Security Agent. If any challenge to the validity, perfection or enforceability of the security interests created by the
security documents were successful, the holders of the Notes may be unable to enforce the security.

Also, under Spanish law, in the event that the relevant obligor enters into insolvency proceedings, the securities or the
parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator, the obligor itself or by other
creditors of such obligor under the rules of avoidance or clawback of Spanish insolvency laws (acción rescisoria concursal)
and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions by the debtor (acción rescisoria pauliana).

**_Corporate Benefit in Cross-collateral Security Structures_**

The Spanish Guarantor will be creating the Spanish Collateral as security of the Notes issued by a company of the
group receiving the financing under the Notes, so it can be argued whether such Spanish Guarantor have obtained a corporate
benefit for granting the relevant guarantee or collateral over their assets.

Unlike other jurisdictions, there is no concept of “corporate benefit” expressly regulated under the Spanish Companies
Act or any other piece of legislation, However, Spanish lower courts, particularly Spanish commercial courts (Juzgados de lo
_Mercantil) ruling on insolvency matters, are declaring null or rescinding upstream guarantees by applying the rebuttable_
presumption of actions detrimental to the estate of an affiliate granting guarantees or security interests in favor of the liabilities
incurred by a parent company and/or other companies of its group for the purposes of article 226 of the Spanish Recast
Insolvency Law (i.e., rescission or claw-back of these actions during the two year hardening period, as described above), when
the obligations guaranteed or secured does not provide for a direct benefit to the Spanish company granting such guarantee or
security interest.


-----

Some decisions by the Spanish Supreme Court are ruling in favor of the validity and enforceability of such guarantees
and security interests to the extent proof can be given that amounts can be borrowed directly by the company granting the
guarantee or security interest or indirectly on-lent or otherwise made available to such company under a intercompany loan
agreement, equity contribution or similar arrangement, also taking into account any indirect benefits deriving from the
enhancement of the financial position of the group of companies to which such company belongs and the granting of parent
guarantees, indemnities and comfort letters for which the relevant company obtains most favorable economic and financial
conditions under its contractual relationships with suppliers and other counterparties, in accordance with Spanish case law
existing as for the construction of the concept of “compensatory advantage” (ventaja compensatoria).

However, it cannot be conclusively ensured that further proof of the actual existence of benefits and compensatory
advantages would need to be delivered to court, to the insolvency administrator and/or the insolvency court in the event of an
insolvency scenario where the claims of the holders of the Notes, particularly as “special privilege claims” may be challenged
if the insolvency administrator or other creditors may allege that such corporate benefit did not exist.

**_Trust Under Spanish Law_**

There is no concept of a security agent, trustee or security trustee under Spanish law and, therefore, trust structures
may not be recognized by Spanish courts. If Spanish law security documents are entered into only by a security agent (i.e., and
not by the creditors on account of whom it would be acting), the security agent will be the only party entitled to enforce the
Guarantee or the security interest in respect of those obligations and to have allowed a secured claim in an insolvency
proceeding (only with respect to its share, if any, in the secured obligation). Under Spanish law there is uncertainty (a) if the
beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in the security agreement will be deemed to have a
valid and perfected security interest under such security as well as a secured claim in insolvency proceedings; and (b) with
respect to the validity of any security interest created in favor of the security trustee under the Notes on behalf of the holders
of the Notes. Therefore, there is a risk that a security agent would only be able to enforce against the debt it individually holds,
and not for the full amount owed to creditors for whom it is acting as security agent or trustee. This limitation may be overcome
if such creditors grant formal powers of attorney in favor of the security agent or trustee in order for the latter to represent them
in the enforcement proceedings (yet, this may not work in judicial enforcement proceedings, where one party cannot represent
another by virtue of a power of attorney).

In the absence of the abovementioned power of attorney, the Security Agent and/or the applicable Trustee may not be
able to enforce the Guarantee or the relevant Spanish security interest on behalf of all of the secured creditors (including the
holders of the Notes). Further, those beneficial holders of the security who have not accepted the security or duly empowered
(by means of notarial and apostilled powers of attorney) the Security Agent and/or the applicable Trustee to do so may be
treated, from a Spanish law perspective including without limitation in an insolvency scenario, as unsecured creditors.

Further, it is worth noting that there is a risk that the relevant court or notary public before whom any Spanish security
interest may eventually be enforced might request both the notarization of the documents from which the relevant obligations
arise, and the notarization of each and every one of the transfer certificates regarding each and every transfer of the Notes.

**_A Brief Description of Certain Aspects of Insolvency Law in Spain and of the Limitations Applicable to the_**
**_Guarantees Provided by Spanish Guarantors_**

The Spanish Royal Legislative Decree 1/2020 of 5 May approving the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, as amended
from time to time (Real Decreto Legislativo 1/2020, de 5 de mayo, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley Concursal)
(the “Spanish Recast Insolvency Law”) regulates pre-insolvency and court insolvency proceedings, as opposed to out-ofcourt liquidation (which, pursuant to Spanish corporate law, is only available when the debtor has sufficient assets to meet its
liabilities). Prospective investors should note that the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law originally regulated by Law 22/2003
suffered various reforms and amendments since first published in 2003. The Spanish Government has approved in 2020 the
latest recasting, in force as from 1 September 2020, in order not only to incorporate all these amendments but also to clarify
and harmonize certain questions raised by the courts and the doctrine since its first application by Spanish courts, however, it
should be noted that certain matters are still be subject to different views and different constructions by the relevant insolvency
courts from time to time.

The entry into force of Directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of June 20, 2019, on
preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of
procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, implies that Spain will have two years as of such date
for the transposition of such Directive into the Spanish regulations. This transposition process will probably lead to the approval


-----

of certain amendments to the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the transposition process has not
been initiated yet and, therefore, is still uncertain how this Directive will affect the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law.

In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 health crisis, the Spanish Government has approved various extraordinary
resolutions. These extraordinary resolutions include, among others, Royal Decree-Law 16/2020 (Real Decreto-ley 16/2020, de
_28 de abril, de medidas procesales y administrativas para hacer frente al COVID-19 en el ámbito de la Administración de_
_Justicia) (“Royal Decree-Law 16/2020”), Royal Decree Law 34/2020 (Real Decreto-ley 34/2020, de 17 de noviembre, de_
_medidas urgentes de apoyo a la solvencia empresarial y al sector energético, y en materia tributaria) or Act 3/2020 (Ley_
_3/2020, de 18 de septiembre, de medidas procesales y organizativas para hacer frente al COVID-19 en el ámbito de la_
_Administración de Justicia) (“Act 3/2020”) as amended pursuant to the Royal Decree-Law 5/2021 of 12 March (Real Decreto-_
_ley 5/2021, de 12 de marzo, de medidas extraordinarias de apoyo a la solvencia empresarial en respuesta a la pandemia de la_
_COVID-19), which have introduced several temporary and extraordinary measures that impact pre-insolvency and insolvency_
proceedings.

_Concept and petition for insolvency_

The Spanish Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Spain. As a general rule, in the event of an insolvency of
the Spanish Guarantors, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Spain and governed by Spanish law. Namely, the Spanish
Recast Insolvency Law, as further amended, regulates court insolvency proceedings.

The Spanish full-blown insolvency proceeding (bankruptcy), which is referred to as “concurso de acreedores,” applies
to all persons and legal entities (save for limited exceptions specifically contemplated in the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law,
such as public entities). These proceedings may lead either to the restructuring of the business or to the liquidation of the assets
of the debtor.

The insolvency laws of Spain may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the laws of the United States,
the United Kingdom or other jurisdictions to which you may be familiar. The following is a brief description of certain aspects
of the insolvency laws of Spain.

In Spain, insolvency proceedings are only triggered upon debtor’s current insolvency (insolvencia actual) or imminent
insolvency (insolvencia inminente). Under the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, a debtor is insolvent when it becomes unable
to regularly meet its obligations as they become due and payable (current insolvency) or when it expects that it will shortly be
unable to do so (imminent insolvency). Insolvency proceedings are available as a type of legal protection that a debtor may
request in order to avoid the attachment of its assets by its creditors.

A petition for current insolvency may be initiated by the debtor (in the case of a company, by a decision of its directors)
(“Voluntary Insolvency”), by any of its creditors, provided that it has not acquired the credit within the six months prior to the
filing of the petition for insolvency, for inter vivos acts, on a singular basis and once the credit was mature or by certain other
interested third parties (“Mandatory Insolvency”). Notwithstanding, only the debtor is entitled to file a petition for insolvency
on the basis of its imminent insolvency.

The Spanish Recast Insolvency Law provides that insolvency proceedings conclude following either the court
confirmation of the implementation of an agreement between the creditors and the debtor or convenio de acreedores (the
“Company Voluntary Agreement” or the “CVA”) or the liquidation of the debtor’s estate. An insolvency proceeding can also
conclude: (i) at any moment when it is verified that there are insufficient assets to pay post-insolvency debt; (ii) at any moment
when it is verified that all of the credits have been paid, or the situation of insolvency does no longer exist; (iii) when it is
verified that all of the creditors have waived their credit rights; or (iv) where only a sole creditor is identified in the definitive
list of creditors.

_Voluntary insolvency_

Insolvency is generally considered voluntary (concurso voluntario) if filed by the relevant debtor. The debtor must
file a petition for insolvency within two months after it becomes aware, or should have become aware, of its state of insolvency.
It is presumed that the debtor becomes aware of its insolvency, unless otherwise proved, if any of the circumstances that qualify
as the basis for a petition for Mandatory Insolvency occur (please see “—Mandatory Insolvency” section below). In the event
of failure to file a petition for insolvency within the statutory two-month period, it may be unable to exercise certain courses of
action and personal liability of the directors may arise or be increased in the event of liquidation for the unpaid claims (on the
basis of a rebuttable presumption that would be applicable in the qualification phase, when the directors’ liabilities are
reviewed).


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this general rule of the debtors’ duty to file for insolvency within the referred
two-month period does not apply if the debtor notifies the relevant court the initiation of negotiations with its creditors, to
obtain support to reach a pre-arranged CVA; a collective out-of-court workout (a refinancing agreement or acuerdo de
_refinanciación) set out in articles 598 or 606 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law; or an out-of-court repayment agreement_
(acuerdo extrajudicial de pagos) under articles 631 et seq. of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law (the “Creditors’ Negotiations
**Communication”).**

If the debtor files with the relevant court a Creditors’ Negotiations Communication (regulated under articles 583 et
seq. of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law), on the top of those two months, the debtor gains an additional three-month period
to (i) obtain accessions to a pre-arranged CVA (propuesta anticipada de convenio), (ii) achieve a refinancing agreement with
its creditors or (iii) achieve an out-of-court repayment agreement, and one further month to file for the declaration of insolvency,
unless it is no longer insolvent. During this three-month period, creditors’ petitions for Mandatory Insolvency will not be
accepted. During the fourth-month period: (i) the debtor has the duty to file for insolvency, unless a pre-arranged CVA, a
collective out-of-court workout or an out–of-court repayment agreement is achieved (i.e., the company would gain four month
grace period to file for insolvency by a Creditors’ Negotiations Communication); and (ii) the mandatory petitions could be filed
but would not be accepted if the debtor has filed a voluntary insolvency petition (i.e., voluntary case filings have priority over
involuntary ones within the fourth month).

Likewise, the Creditors’ Negotiations Communication to obtain support to reach a pre-arranged CVA or a collective
out-of-court workout (a refinancing agreement or acuerdo de refinanciación) set out in articles 598 or 606 of the Spanish Recast
Insolvency Law, prevents the commencement of court or out-of-court enforcement actions and/or suspends (as applicable)
existing enforcement actions, over assets or rights which are necessary for the company’s business operations (other than those
arising from public law claims) during a three-month period. In addition, enforcement proceedings that have been brought by
creditors holding financial liabilities (pasivos financieros), as defined in article 606 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, shall
be prohibited or suspended (as applicable); provided that it is evidenced that at least 51% of the creditors holding financial
liabilities (by value) have supported the initiation of negotiations to enter into a refinancing agreement and have agreed to
suspend or not initiate enforcement proceedings against the debtor while creditors holding financial liabilities are still
negotiating. Nevertheless, secured creditors shall be entitled to bring enforcement proceedings against the corresponding
secured assets. However, if these secured assets are necessary for the continuity of the debtor’s business or professional activity,
once enforcement proceedings have been initiated, they shall be immediately suspended until three months have elapsed from
the date when the Creditors’ Negotiations Communication is filed. Financial securities subject to the RDL 5/2005 and security
interests over collateral located outside of Spain should not be affected by the Creditors’ Negotiations Communication
automatic stay.

Please note that, as a consequence of the of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Spanish government has enacted the Act
3/2020, as amended, which has stayed the obligation to file for insolvency until December 31, 2021 (please note that despite
their obligation having been stayed, the directors still have the right to file for insolvency upon current or imminent insolvency).

Likewise, according to the Act 3/2020, if the debtor filed a Creditors’ Negotiations Communication before December
31, 2020, the debtor has a six month grace period to file for insolvency as from the filing of the notice (instead of the ordinary
four-month term).

_Mandatory Insolvency_

Insolvency is considered necessary (concurso necesario) if filed by a third-party creditor and, in certain cases, by the
insolvency mediator (mediador concursal). Under Section 2.4 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, a creditor can seek a
debtor’s declaration of insolvency if (i) such creditor can prove that the debtor has failed to attach any assets, or sufficient
assets, to pay the amount owed; or (ii) evidences before court a final previous judicial or administrative declaration of
insolvency; or (iii) there is a generalized default on payments by such debtor; (iv) there is a seizure of assets affecting or
comprising the generality of such debtor’s assets; or (v) there is a misplacement, “fire sale” or ruinous liquidation of the debtor’s
assets; or (vi) there is a generalized default on certain tax, social security and employment obligations during the applicable
statutory period (three months) prior to the filing of the relevant insolvency request. Upon receipt of an insolvency petition by
a creditor, the court may issue provisional interim measures to protect the assets of a debtor and may request a guarantee from
the petitioning creditor asking for the adoption of such measures to cover damages caused by the preliminary protective
measures.

The relevant debtor may oppose to the mandatory insolvency petition, and for which it will have to prove that it is not
insolvent, unless the creditor’s insolvency petition is based on (i) the evidence of a final previous judicial or administrative
final declaration of insolvency; (ii) the failure to seize sufficient assets of the debtor to pay the amounts owed; or (iii) the seizure


-----

of assets affecting or comprising the generality of such debtor’s assets, where the Insolvency Court (as defined below) will
hand down an order declaring the opening of the insolvency proceeding without hearing the debtor. In this case, the Insolvency
Court (as defined below) will then summon the parties to a hearing, and will finally render a court ruling either dismissing the
application filed by the creditor, or declaring the insolvency of the debtor.

Pursuant to the Act 3/2020, until December 31, 2021, inclusive, the insolvency court shall not process the creditors’
filings for involuntary insolvency proceedings submitted since March 14, 2020. Any debtor’s filing for voluntary insolvency
made until December 31, 2021 shall prevail over any filings made by any creditor.

_Request of coordinated insolvency_

The insolvency of a company that forms part of a group of companies, including the parent company, does not
automatically lead to the insolvency of the remaining companies of the group. As stated above, a company is insolvent when it
cannot regularly meet its payment obligations as they fall due. This analysis is conducted individually at each company level.

Notwithstanding the above, creditors may apply for a coordinated insolvency declaration of two or more of its debtors
(acumulación de concursos) if either: (a) the assets are commingled, or (b) such debtors form part of the same group of
companies.

Therefore, the request for the coordinated insolvency of two or more legal entities may only be filed by a common
creditor of the relevant companies and each of the affected companies must in fact be separately insolvent.

Coordinated insolvency may also be requested by the companies themselves provided that they form part of the same
group.

As to ongoing insolvency proceedings, any of the insolvent debtors or the insolvency administrator, as the case may
be, may apply for the procedural coordination under certain circumstances (and, in particular, if the insolvent debtors form part
of the same group of companies). Moreover, creditors may apply for the procedural coordination of the insolvency proceedings
of two or more of its debtors already declared if either (a) the assets are commingled, or (b) they pertain to the same group of
companies, provided that a petition has not been submitted by any of the insolvent debtors or by the insolvency administrator
pursuant to Article 41 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law.

It is important to note that coordinated insolvency proceedings do not entail substantive consolidation. As a result, and
as a general rule, a “group insolvency” does not lead to a commingling of the debtors’ assets and creditors of such group. This
means that the creditors of one company of the group will not have recourse against other companies of the same group (except
where cross-guarantees exist, in which case such a financial claim shall be subordinated).

The current system that the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law provides for is basically a procedural which is aimed at
making the insolvency proceedings as time and cost-efficient as possible. However, exceptionally, for the purpose of drafting
the insolvency report, by the insolvency administrator only, assets and liabilities amongst the insolvent companies may be
consolidated where the estates and liabilities are so commingled, in order to avert unjustified cost and delay.

_Enforcement and termination in a pre-insolvency scenario_

It is uncertain that the obligations under the Notes and the Guarantee of the Spanish Guarantor will be enforced in
accordance with their respective terms in every circumstance, such enforcement being subject to, inter alia, the nature of the
remedies available in the Spanish courts, the acceptance by such court of jurisdiction, the discretion of the courts, the power of
such courts to stay proceedings, the provisions of the Spanish law on civil procedure (Ley 1/2000, de 7 de enero, de
_Enjuiciamento Civil, the “Spanish Law on Civil Procedure”) regarding remedies and enforcement measures available under_
Spanish law, the provisions of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law and other principles of law of general application. In this
regard:

     - Spanish law does not expressly recognize the concept of an indemnity. Article 1,152 of the Spanish Civil Code
(Código Civil) establishes that any penalty (cláusula penal) agreed by the parties in an agreement will substitute
damages (indemnización de daños) and the payment of interest (abono de intereses) in an event of breach, unless
otherwise agreed. Spanish courts may modify the penalty agreed between the relevant parties on an equitable
basis if the debtor has partially or irregularly performed its obligations, unless the specific penalty (liquidated


-----

damages) was aimed at such partial performance (and the liquidated damages clause is not disproportionate under
fairness standards). There is serious doubt as to the enforceability in Spain of punitive damages.

     - Where obligations are to be performed in a jurisdiction outside Spain, they may not be enforceable in Spain to
the extent that performance would be illegal under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction.

     - Spanish law precludes the validity and performance of contractual obligations to be left at the discretion of one
of the contracting parties. Therefore, Spanish courts may refuse to uphold and enforce terms and conditions of an
agreement giving discretionary authority to one of the contracting parties to have to fulfil it.

     - Spanish law, as applied by the Spanish Supreme Court, precludes an agreement being terminated on the basis of
a breach of obligations, undertakings or covenants that are agreed as ancillary or complementary to the main
payment undertakings of the relevant agreement and allows Spanish courts not to enforce any such breaches,
unless otherwise established by the parties as a specific and essential termination event. Under Spanish law, acts
carried out in accordance with the terms of a legal provision whenever said acts seek a result which is forbidden
by or contrary to another law, shall be deemed to have been executed in circumvention of law (fraude de ley) and
the provisions whose application was intended to be avoided shall apply.

     - A Spanish Court may award damages if the specific performance of an obligation is deemed impracticable.

    - A Spanish Court may amend the terms of contracts to the extent required to restore a proportionate balance
between the obligations of both parties where such balance has been materially altered to the benefit of one of the
parties because of the occurrence of unexpected and exceptional circumstances, which were unforeseeable at the
time when the contract was executed.

     - A Spanish Court may modify the obligations deriving from contracts in the terms considered necessary in order
to restore the balance between the obligations, if unexpected and exceptional circumstances arise that were
unforeseeable when the contracts were executed, which would have been expressly or implicitly assumed.

_Certain effects of insolvency_

For the debtor

As a general rule and subject to certain exceptions, the debtor in a voluntary insolvency retains its powers to manage
and dispose of its business (debtor in possession proceedings), but is subject to the supervision of the insolvency administrator
(administración concursal) appointed by the court. In the case of mandatory insolvency, as a general rule and subject to certain
exceptions, the debtor no longer has power over its assets, and management powers (including the power to dispose of assets)
are conferred solely to the insolvency administrator. However, the court has the power to modify this general regime subject to
the specific circumstances of the case. In addition, upon the insolvency administrator request, the court has the power to swap
the intervention regime for a suspension regime or vice versa.

Actions carried out by the debtor in breach of any required supervision of the insolvency authorities may be declared
null and void unless ratified by the insolvency administrators.

Subject to certain exceptions linked to the maintenance and conservation of the debtor’s estate, the debtor shall not
sell or create security over its rights and assets without the Court’s authortization until the approval of the CVA or the opening
of the liquidation phase.

On contracts

Under articles 156-159 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, all clauses in contracts with reciprocal obligations that
allow any party to terminate an agreement based solely on the other party’s declaration of insolvency are deemed as not included
in the agreement and, therefore, unenforceable, except if expressly permitted by specific laws (i.e., agency laws or the Spanish
Royal Decree Law 5/2005, applicable to financial collateral, as defined therein (“RDL 5/2005”)).

A declaration of insolvency does not affect the effectiveness of contracts with reciprocal obligations pending on
performance by both the insolvent party and the counterparty, which remain in full force and effect and the obligations of the
insolvent debtor will be fulfilled against the insolvent estate as post-insolvency credits/estate claims (con cargo a la masa).


-----

However, if there has been a breach of such an agreement by either party after it has been declared insolvent, the court can
terminate any such contracts at the request of the non-breaching party of the agreement or declare that the agreement remains
in force because it is beneficial for the insolvency proceedings (mantenimiento del contrato en interés del concurso), in which
case the non-insolvent party is entitled to seek specific performance against the insolvent estate and the claims stemming from
such agreement will be considered as a post-insolvency credit/estate claims.

Likewise, even in the event of non-breach by the counterparty of its obligations under such an agreement after the
declaration of insolvency of the debtor, the insolvency administrator (together with the insolvent debtor or by its sole discretion
if the insolvent debtor’s powers to manage and dispose of its business have been conferred to the insolvency administrator, as
provided above) may request the insolvency court to resolve the termination of the agreement (on the grounds of convenience
for the insolvency proceedings (resolución del contrato en interés del concurso)). The termination of such contracts may result
in the insolvent debtor having to return, and indemnify damages to, its counterpart against the insolvent estate. In the event that
the insolvent debtor, the insolvency administrator and the counterparty agree on the termination of the agreement and its effects,
the insolvency court will approve the parties’ agreement; otherwise, if the insolvency court upholds termination, it will also fix
the damages claim to be received by the non-breaching party due to the termination of the agreement.

Additionally, the declaration of insolvency determines that interest accrual is suspended, except (i) pursuant to recent
case law from the Spanish Supreme Court and article 152 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, ordinary/legal interest secured
with an in rem right (so long as included as a contingent claim in the proof of claims), in which case interest accrues up to the
value of the security (9/10 of the collateral fair value minus senior claims) (i.e., default interest are in any event stayed following
the insolvency declaration) and (ii) any wage credits in favor of employees, which will accrue the legal interest set forth in the
corresponding Law of the State Budget (Ley de Presupuestos del Estado).

On enforcement proceedings

As a general rule, the enforcement rights of unsecured creditors are suspended upon the court declaration of insolvency
(with the exception of certain actions conducted by public authorities that no do not concern assets necessary for the
continuation of the commercial or professional activity of the debtor). Additionally, once the insolvency proceeding is declared
open, singular, judicial or extrajudicial enforcements may not be initiated, nor may administrative or tax demands for payment
to be collected coercively against the assets of the debtor be continued.

The enforcement of any security over assets or rights that are necessary for the continuation of the commercial or
professional activity of the debtor may not be commenced and the procedures already initiated before the declaration of
insolvency shall be suspended for one year. Enforcement will be suspended even if at the time of declaration of insolvency the
notices announcing the public auction have been published.

i. After such one-year moratorium without liquidation having started, a separated enforcement could be
instituted, so long as the secured creditor is not bound by a creditors’ agreement affecting its claim.

ii. Enforcement proceedings conducted before other courts or notary publics will be stayed within this one-year
period unless the insolvency court declares that the collateral is not necessary for the continuation of the
commercial or professional activity of the debtor.

When it comes to determining which assets or rights of the debtor are used for its professional or business activities,
courts have generally embraced a broad interpretation and will likely include most of the debtor’s assets and rights.
Nevertheless, shares/quota shares held by an insolvent debtor in another company whose only activity is the holding of a
material asset and servicing the financing provided in connection with the acquisition of that asset, are not considered to be an
asset necessary for the debtor's business activity as long as the foreclosure of the relevant security interest that has been granted
over such shares/quota shares does not bring about the termination or amendment of the insolvent debtor’s contracts with such
subsidiary allowing the insolvent debtor to exploit such asset.

The above regime does not affect financial collateral foreseen under RDL 5/2005 (the Spanish law implementing the
EU Financial Collateral Directive), which shall be still enforceable, or where the collateral is located in another EU member
state by the time of insolvency declaration. If the collateral is located in a non-EU state by the time of insolvency declaration,
the automatic stay (if any) and, in general, the effects of the insolvency will be governed by the insolvency law of the state
where the collateral is located.

Pursuant to articles 44, 52 et seq. and 142 et seq. of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, in order to protect the interests
of the debtor and creditors, the jurisdiction of the court dealing with insolvency proceedings is extended to handle any


-----

enforcement proceedings or interim measures affecting the debtor’s assets (whether based upon civil, labor or administrative
law).

As a general rule, insolvency proceedings are not compatible with other enforcement proceedings which can have an
effect on the insolvent estate (excluding enforcement proceedings with regard to financial collateral (as defined in RDL 5/2005)
or collateral located in an EU state other the Spain or, subject to local law, a third state. When compatible, in order to protect
the interests of the debtor and creditors, the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law extends the jurisdiction of the court dealing with
insolvency proceedings, which is then legally authorized to handle any enforcement proceedings or interim measures affecting
the debtor’s assets (whether based upon civil, labor, or administrative law).

Finally, prospective investors should also note that enforcement of any security interests will be subject to the
provisions of Spanish Law on Civil Procedure and Spanish Recast Insolvency Law (where applicable), which may entail delays
in the enforcement.

_Ranking of claims (priority rules)_

The court decision issued by the competent Insolvency Court declaring the opening of insolvency proceedings for a
particular debtor (auto de declaración de concurso) shall contain an express request for the creditors (i) to declare those debts
owed to them within the period of one month period as from the day after the publication of the insolvency proceedings in the
Spanish Official Gazette (Boletín Oficial del Estado), and (ii) to provide the insolvency administrator with the relevant
documentation to justify such credits.

Based on the documentation provided by the creditors and documentation held by the debtor, the court insolvency
administrator shall draw up a list of acknowledged creditors/claims and classify them according to the categories established
in the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law that are summarized below.

Under the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, claims are classified in two groups:

i. Post-insolvency credits/Estate claims (créditos contra la masa): Section 242 of the Spanish Recast
Insolvency Law sets out the so-called “estate claims,” which are pre-deductible (when they become due)
claims from the estate (excluding those assets of the insolvent debtor subject to in rem security). Debt against
the insolvent estate includes, among others: (i) certain amounts of the employee payroll; (ii) costs and
expenses of the insolvency proceedings; (iii) certain amounts arising from services provided by the insolvent
debtor under reciprocal contracts and outstanding obligations that are declared to remain in force after
insolvency declaration as well as obligations to return and indemnity in cases of voluntary termination or
breach by the insolvent debtor; (iv) those that derive from the exercise of a claw back action within the
insolvency proceeding concerning bilateral contracts (except in cases of bad faith), (v) certain amounts
arising from obligations created by law or tort liability of the insolvent debtor after the declaration of
insolvency and until its conclusion; (vi) certain debts incurred by the debtor following the declaration of
insolvency; (vii) insolvency administrator’s fees; (viii) in case of liquidation, the financing granted to the
debtor under a CVA; and (ix) 50% of the new funds lent under a refinancing agreement entered into in
compliance with the requirements set forth in articles 598 or 606 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law,
excluding the new funds lent by persons being in a special relationship with the debtor through a share capital
increase, loan or analogous transaction. These post-insolvency claims are deemed “super-senior” in the sense
that they are not subject to ranking or acknowledgement and, in principle, must be paid as and when they fall
due; therefore, these claims are preferred to all others, except for proceeds from collateral subject to specially
privileged claims (as described below).

ii. Insolvency claims (créditos concursales): Insolvency claims are classified as follows:

         - Specially Privileged Claims (créditos con privilegio especial): Creditors benefiting from special
privileges, representing security over certain assets (in rem securities) up to the amount of the value of
their security, provided that such security is listed in the creditors’ list (in this regard, the value of a
security shall be 90% of the reasonable value of the secured asset determined in accordance with the
rules set out in articles 273 et seq of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law minus senior claims). The part
of the claim exceeding the value of their security will be classified according to the nature of the claim.
These claims benefiting from special privileges may entail separate proceedings, though subject to
certain restrictions derived from a waiting period that may last up to one year and certain additional
limitations set forth in the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law. As a general rule, privileged creditors are not


-----

subject to the CVA, except if they are the authors of the CVA, they adhere to the CVA if certain majorities
have been reached among privileged creditors of the same class (see “—Conclusion of Insolvency—
_Settlement”). In the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment against the assets on which_
they are secured up to the secured amount. However, the insolvency administrator has the option to halt
any enforcement of the securities and pay these claims as administrative expenses under specific
payment rules.

         - Generally Privileged Claims (créditos con privilegio general): Creditors benefiting from a general
privilege, including, among others, (i) specific labor claims and specific claims brought by public entities
or authorities; (ii) 50% of the claims held by the creditor who filed for the insolvency of the debtor
(provided that it is not a subordinated creditor); and (iii) 50% of the new funds under a refinancing
agreement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in articles 598 or 606 of the Spanish
Recast Insolvency Law. Similarly to specially privileged claims, these generally privileged claims are
not subject to the CVA unless creditors holding claims benefiting from general privileges which represent
at least 60% (or 75% depending on the workout measures envisaged under the CVA) of the total value
of claims benefiting from general privileges of the same class vote in favor of such Reorganization Plan.
In the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment against assets other than those secured
by a specially privileged claim after specially privileged creditors, in accordance with the ranking
established under the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law.

         - Ordinary Claims (créditos ordinarios): Ordinary creditors are all those creditors who have claims that
are not classified as non subordinated or non privileged claims, and they shall be paid pro rata once the
estate claims and both generally and specially privileged claims have been paid.

         - Subordinated Claims (créditos subordinados): Subordinated creditors is a category of claims which
includes, among others: credits communicated late (outside the specific one-month period mentioned
above); credits which are contractually subordinated vis-à-vis all other credits of the debtor; credits
relating to unpaid interest claims (including default interest), except for those ordinary interests (as
opposed to default interests) secured with an in rem right up to the value of the security interest; fines;
and claims of creditors which are “specially related parties” to the insolvent debtor.

In the case of a legal entity, the following shall be deemed as “specially related parties”: (i) shareholders with unlimited
liability (in case such shareholders are natural persons it would include any special related party to these shareholders, as
described herein); (ii) limited liability shareholders holding directly or indirectly 10% or more of the insolvent company’s share
capital (or 5% if the company is listed or has securities listed in a secondary official market) at the time the credit is generated;
(iii) directors (de jure, _de facto or shadow directors), insolvency liquidators, shadow directors and those holding general powers_
of attorney from the insolvent company (including those people that have held these positions during the two years prior to the
declaration of insolvency); and (iv) companies pertaining to the same group as the debtor and their respective shareholders
provided such shareholders meet the minimum shareholding requirements set forth in (ii) above (i.e. 10% or 5% if the relevant
company is listed). Furthermore, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, assignees or awardees of claims belonging to any
of the persons mentioned in this paragraph are presumed to be persons specially related to the insolvent debtor as long as the
acquisition has taken place within two years prior to the insolvency proceedings being declared open.

Notwithstanding the above, creditors who have directly or indirectly capitalized their credit rights pursuant to a
refinancing agreement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in articles 598 or 606 of the Spanish Recast
Insolvency Law (and who have even been appointed as directors) shall not be considered as being in a special relationship with
the debtor, in respect of credits against the debtor, as a result of the financing granted under such refinancing agreement. Claims
related to accrued and unpaid interest, unless and to the extent they are secured by an in rem, right are also subordinated.

Subordinated creditors are second-level creditors. They do not have voting rights on the CVA but are subject to its
terms, being paid once ordinary claims are satisfied pursuant to the terms of the CVA. Thus, subordinated creditors have limited
chances of collecting payment according to the ranking established in the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law.

As an exception to the subordination regime, new financing granted to the debtor pursuant to a refinancing agreement
regulated under articles 598 or 606 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, which also contemplates a capitalization of credit
rights before the granting of new financing, shall not be classified as subordinated claim under article 281 of the Spanish Recast
Insolvency Law; provided that the requirements set out in article 283 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law are met. This is an
incentive to promote refinancing and capitalization of credit rights.


-----

Moreover, as a consequence of the of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Act 3/2020, of September 18 (in force as of
September 20) has enhanced the position of certain “specially related parties” in order to solve situations of lack of liquidity.
Accordingly, in insolvency proceedings declared on or before 14 March 2022: (i) financing granted by specially related parties;
or (ii) financing in which they have been subrogated as creditors because of due payment (e.g., as a result of the enforcement
of a personal guarantee, resulting in a claim of the guarantor vis-à-vis the debtor) would not be subordinated, but rather
considered ordinary or privileged credit claims.

_No termination effect_

The general principle of “no termination effect” is established such that all agreements remain effective at the time of
the insolvency. Therefore, the declaration of insolvency does not impair the existence of the contracts entered into by the debtor,
which would remain in force. Any contractual arrangements establishing the termination of a contract with reciprocal
obligations and/or entitling the relevant creditor to terminate it in the event of the declaration of insolvency of the debtor will
be unenforceable.

As a general rule, the declaration of insolvency does not alter the general contractual rules on termination, but under
the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, the judge may decide to remedy an eventual default of the insolvent party by reinstating
an agreement, with the effect that any outstanding amounts and further payments under the agreement will be post-insolvency
claims. If the court deems it appropriate for the interests of the insolvent party, it is also entitled to terminate an agreement,
with compensation for damages if it deems it is best for the insolvency proceeding. There are specific rules for employment
agreements, mainly affecting collective dismissals, which are dealt with by the insolvency judge.

Additionaly, the insolvency administrator, on its own initiative or at the request of the insolvent party, may reinstate
the credit, loan and other financing agreements whose acceleration due to non-payment of principal or accrued interest has
occurred within the three months preceding the insolvency declaration (unless the creditor opposes it on the grounds that, prior
to the insolvency declaration, has initiated proceedings for payment of the sums due against the debtor or any codebtor or
guarantor).

_Set-off_

The Spanish Recast Insolvency Law generally prohibits set off of the credits (compensación de créditos) and debts of
the insolvent company once it has been declared insolvent, unless the legal requirement for set-off were met prior to the
insolvency declaration; set-off of credits and debts which arise from the same contractual relationship entered into before the
declaration of insolvency can be subject to set-off. However, set-off may be exercised by a determined creditor vis-à-vis the
insolvent company if the governing law of the reciprocal credit right of the insolvent company permits it under insolvency
scenarios.

_Hardening periods_

There is no claw back date by operation of law. Therefore, there are no prior transactions that automatically become
void as a result of the initiation of insolvency proceedings, but instead the insolvency administrator (or creditors that have asked
the insolvency administrator to do so in the absence of action by the insolvency administrator) must expressly challenge those
transactions that are considered detrimental to the insolvent debtor’s estate. Under the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, in
particular under article 226 therein, upon the declaration of insolvency, only transactions that could be deemed as having
damaged (perjudiciales) the insolvent debtor’s estate (i.e., causing a so-called “patrimonial damage”) during the two years
prior to the date the insolvency is declared, may be challenged, even if there was no fraudulent intention. Transactions taking
place earlier than two years prior to the declaration of insolvency may be rescinded subject to Spanish Civil Code based actions
(i.e., fraudulent conveyance, which has a four-year look-back period).

The Spanish Recast Insolvency Law does not define the meaning of “patrimonial damage.” Damage does not refer to
the intention of the parties, but to the consequences of the transaction on the debtor’s interest resulting in the damage to the
insolvent debtor’s estate or the prejudice to the equality of the treatment among creditors which drives insolvency proceedings
(par condition creditorum). There are several “irrebuttable presumptions” expressly set forth by the Spanish Recast Insolvency
Law (i.e., free disposals and prepayment or cancellation of the company’s claims or obligations prior to them being due and
where the due dates of the relevant claims or payment obligations fall after the date of declaration of insolvency), except if
such obligations were secured by an in rem security, in which case such transactions are subject to a rebuttable presumption of
“patrimonial change” as set forth below. In addition to the above, the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law sets forth certain actions
which are deemed to cause a “patrimonial damage” to the insolvent company, but which are “rebuttable presumptions” and
therefore subject to being contested by the other party (i.e., disposals in favor of “specially related parties” (as described above),


-----

the provision of security in respect of previously existing obligations or in respect of new obligations replacing existing ones
and the payment or other acts to terminate obligations being secured by an in rem security and which mature after the date of
declaration of insolvency). Ordinary transactions carried out within the debtor’s ordinary course of business cannot be
rescinded; provided that they are carried out at arm’s length.

Consequently, those acts that have been entered into by the relevant debtor may be rescinded if carried out during the
two year hardening period and considered detrimental for such debtor’s estate. In particular, judges have considered detrimental
payments made by an insolvent company prior to a declaration of insolvency, determining that in some situations a debtor
could not be compelled to repay its obligations at the time of payment, because it was already unable to regularly pay debts as
they came due.

Guarantees granted by a Spanish company in favor of a third party, to secure other group companies’ debt may be
subject to claw back, on the basis that such guarantees may be considered as detrimental to the guarantor’s estate, if the
guarantor is not able to show that there was a tangible and identifiable corporate benefit for the guarantor to grant such guarantee
(beyond an abstract group interest or general mentions to pertinence to the same group of companies or the so-called “group
interest”). Whether or not the granting of any upstream guarantee by the guarantor is detrimental to the guarantor’s estate is a
factual matter that will need to be proven on a case by case basis in accordance with the Spanish Supreme Court doctrine (the
beneficiary of the guarantee bearing the burden of such proof).

Case law has sustained that, when the parties had envisaged the creation of the security at the time of granting the financing,
if there is a solid business reason to delay the constitution of the security, damage would not exist. In this sense, the Court ruling
from Commercial Court no. 1 of Oviedo, dated February 18, 2010 (AC 2010\525) indicated that “in order to value if a security is
_contextual to the creation or birth of the claim, it must be verified if the transactions that gave rise to granting the claim and the_
_security were conceived by the parties simultaneously, hence reducing any importance given to the temporary delays there may_
_be in order to technically grant the security.”_

Neither refinancing agreements regulated in articles 598 or 606 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, nor any
transactions, acts and payments accomplished or any guarantees instituted in the performance of such refinancing agreements,
will be subject to an insolvency clawback actions, provided that they comply with the requirements set out below in section
“—Cramdown effects of certain refinancing agreements.”

The consequence of the court resolution rescinding a prejudicial act is that the parties involved are required to return
their reciprocal consideration with any accrued rents or interest (concerning bilateral contracts, otherwise, the only party obliged
to return is the non-insolvent one). Such claims are generally regarded as estate claims unless in case of bad faith of the relevant
creditor in which case its claims will be subordinated.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to article 16 of the EU Insolvency Regulation and 730 of the Spanish Recast
Insolvency Law, acts and transactions governed by laws other than Spanish law will not be subject to claw back actions if such
act or transaction cannot be rescinded or challenged by any means and under any grounds whatsoever (i.e., not only in
insolvency scenarios) under the relevant non-Spanish applicable laws. Procedurally, there is no safe harbor against a lawsuit
being filed and lenders being served to appear before Spanish courts, but the lawsuit should be dismissed on the merits if
lenders prove (i) that the act or transaction at issue is subject to foreign law and (ii) that such act or transaction is unavoidable
under the circumstances pursuant to that foreign law.

_Protection of certain refinancing agreements_

Certain refinancing agreements denominated “collective refinancing agreements” may be protected from claw-back
risk provided that they comply with certain requirements further explained in the section referred to as “Cramdown effects of
_certain refinancing agreements.”_

In the case that such refinancing agreements are not subject to the procedure of judicial sanctioning therein described
(homologados), they may still have certain (but not total) protection against claw-back, if they are backed by at least 3/5 (60%)
of the total claims of the insolvent debtor (calculated on an individual and on a consolidated basis but excluding intragroup
claims). Among other requisites, the refinancing agreements must be founded on a viability plan reflecting that the insolvent
debtor will be viable in the short and medium term and must comply with the rest of requirements explained below.


-----

_Cramdown effects of certain refinancing agreements_

In order to seek protection against claw-back, refinancing agreements (out-of-court workouts) may be judicially
sanctioned (homologados) by the commercial court that will be competent to conduct an eventual insolvency proceeding of the
debtor, upon request by the debtor or by any creditor having entered into such refinancing agreements, if: (i) the refinancing
agreement is entered into in the context of a viability plan that allows the continuity of the professional activity of the debtor
in the short and medium term; (ii) they entail a significant enlargement of debtor’s credit or a change in the financial structure
by either granting a longer term or replacing previous claims with new ones; (iii) they have been subscribed by creditors holding
financial liabilities representing, at least, 51% of the debtor’s financial liabilities whether or not subject to financial supervision
(excluding from the calculation of such thresholds public creditors, labor creditors and those of commercial transactions) at the
date of the refinancing agreement; (iv) the debtor’s auditor issues a certificate acknowledging that the required thresholds have
been reached (in the case of a group of companies, certain courts have held that the majority refers both individually to each
company and to the group as a whole, without the intercompany claims being taken into account); and (v) the refinancing
agreement and the documents substantiating performance of conditions (iii) to (iv) above are formalized in a public instrument.
Such judicially sanctioned refinancing agreements may not be subject to a claw-back action (save in case of fraud under general
fraudulent conveyance actions).

As to the rules to calculate whether the required thresholds have been reached, all creditors holding an interest in a
syndicated loan will be deemed to have adhered to the refinancing agreement if it is favorably voted upon by at least 75% of
the liabilities represented by the loan, or a lower majority if so established in the syndicated loan agreement. Whether dissident
financial creditors have standing to object to homologation and whether the crammed down content may fall beyond the
statutory one is not clear among Spanish scholars or courts and therefore it is not possible yet to ascertain what its practical
effects will be.

The following effects of homologated refinancing agreements may be imposed on (i) dissenting or non-participating
unsecured financial creditors or (ii) on dissenting or non-participating secured financial creditors to the extent of that part of
their secured claim not covered by their security interest, as such security interest is to be valued in accordance with the rules
set out in the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law:

(a) If the judicially sanctioned refinancing agreement is supported by creditors representing at least 60% of the
debtor’s financial liabilities:

i. stays of payments either of principal, interest or any other owed amount may be granted for up to
five years; or

ii. the debt converted into so-called profit participation loans (préstamos participativos)
profit-participating loans of duration up to 5 years.

Further, these effects may be extended to the amount of secured claims of non-participating or dissenting
financial creditors in the amount covered by their security interest (valued in accordance with the rules set
out in articles 273-277 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law), when the agreement has been entered into by
financial creditors holding secured claims which represent at least 65% of the value of all secured claims of
the debtor.

(b) If the homologated refinancing agreement is supported by creditors representing at least 75% of the debtor’s
aggregate financial liabilities:

i. a deferral either of principal, interest or any other owed amount for a period of 5 or more years (but
not more than 10 years);

ii. haircuts (note that a cap has not been established);

iii. capitalization of debt. Nevertheless, those creditors that have not supported such refinancing
agreement (either because they did not sign the agreement or because they oppose it) may choose
between (i) the debt for equity swap contemplated by the agreement; or (ii) a discharge of their
claims equal to the nominal amount (including any share premium) of the shares/quota shares that
would have corresponded to that creditor as a consequence of the relevant debt for equity swap
(which works as the default option);


-----

iv. conversion of debt into profit participating loans of up to 10 years, convertible bonds, subordinated
loans, payment in kind facilities, or in any other financial instrument with a ranking, maturity and
features different to the original debt; and

v. assignment of assets or rights as assignment in kind for total or partial payment of the debt (datio
_pro solute or pro solvendo)._

Further, these effects may be extended to the amount of secured claims of non-participating or dissenting
financial creditors in the amount covered by their security interest (valued in accordance with the rules set
out in articles 273-277 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law), when the agreement has been entered into by
financial creditors holding secured claims which represent at least 80% of the value of all secured claims of
the debtor.

_Conclusion of insolvency_

Settlement

Once the debtor’s assets and liabilities have been identified, the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law encourages creditors
to reach a CVA regarding payment of the insolvency debts. The CVA may be proposed either by the debtor or by the creditors
(if certain thresholds are met in the value of the claims of the relevant proposing creditors), and it shall set forth how, when and
up to what amount creditors are to be paid. Once executed, the CVA must be honored by the debtor and respected by the
creditors.

The CVA must contain proposals for write-offs and stays. Article 317 of Spanish Recast Insolvency Law provides that
it may also contain alternative or additional proposals for all creditors or for certain classes of creditors (except for public
entities), including conversion of debt into shares, into profit-sharing credits, convertible bonds or subordinated debt, or any
financial instrument different from the original debt. It may also include proposals for allocation of all assets or of certain assets
to a specific person with a commitment from the acquirer to continue the activity and to pay off the debt as determined in the
CVA.

The proposals in the CVA shall include a payment schedule.

In order for a CVA to be deemed approved by the creditors, the following majorities shall be met at the creditors’
meeting:

(a) In case the CVA contains write-offs equal to or less than 50% of the amount of the claims; to stays on the
payment of principal, interest or any other outstanding amount, for a period not exceeding five years; or, in
the case of creditors other than those related to the public administration or employment matters, the
conversion of debt into profit participating loans (préstamos participativos) over the same period, at least
50% of the unsecured liabilities (ordinary claims) have voted in favor of such CVA. Notwithstanding the
above, a simple majority will suffice when the CVA consists of (i) full payment of ordinary or unsecured
claims within a period not exceeding three years or (ii) immediate repayment of outstanding ordinary
unsecured claims applying a write off of less than 20%.

(b) In case the CVA contains stays of between five and ten years; write-offs of more than 50% of the amount of
the claims and, in the case of creditors other than those related to the public administration or employment
matters, the conversion of debt into profit-participating loans over the same period and any other proposal
permitted under the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, 65% of the unsecured liabilities (ordinary credits) should
have voted for the CVA.

The holders of subordinated credits and those creditors considered as especially related to the debtor are not entitled
to vote.

Although in principle privileged creditors are not subject to an approved CVA (unless they have expressly voted in its
favor) the effects of an approved CVA can be extended to privileged creditors; provided that the relevant CVA has been
approved by the following majorities of creditors within its category of creditors (labor creditors, public law creditors, financial
creditors or others):


-----

(a) In case the CVA contains a write-off (or debt discharges) equal to or less than 50% of the amount of the
claims, stays for a period no longer than 5 years or conversion of debt into profit participating loans, also for
a period no longer than 5 years, at least 60% of privileged creditors have voted in favor; and

(b) In case the CVA contains a write-off of more than 50% of the claim; stays (for a period between 5 and
10 years), conversion of debt into profit participating loans also for a period between 5 and 10 years, and any
other proposal permitted under the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, at least 75% of privileged creditors have
voted in favor.

Pursuant to the Act 3/2020, A debtor can file a proposal for the amendment of the CVA until December 31, 2021. The
insolvency court shall notify the debtor of any creditors’ requests filed between January 31, 2021 and September 30, 2021 for
the declaration of breach of a CVA and shall not process them until December 31, 2021. During those three months, the debtor
may file a proposal to amend the settlement agreement, which will be processed ahead of any creditors’ request for a declaration
of breach.

Liquidation

Failure to obtain the approval of a CVA, a breach of a court-sanctioned CVA (as declared by the insolvency court) or
upon debtor’s petition at any time leads to liquidation. The debtor must file a petition for liquidation if, after a CVA has been
approved, it becomes aware of no longer being able to meet the payment commitments and obligations undertaken after the
approval of such CVA. In such a case, the company will be aimed at dissolution and the directors (in the event of voluntary
insolvency) will be removed. Deferred credits will compulsorily fall due and credits consisting of other benefits are converted
into cash credits.

The insolvency administrator will be required to prepare a liquidation plan that must be approved by the insolvency
court. The insolvency administrator is required to report quarterly on the liquidation and has one year to complete it (although
this is subject to extension by the relevant Court, at the request of the insolvency administration, what is the normal practice.
If the liquidation is not completed within one year (or within the time agreed by the relevant Court after the petitions for
extension), the court may appoint a different insolvency administrator.

Pursuant to the Act 3/2020, the suspension of the debtor’s obligation to request the opening of the liquidation phase
has been extended also until December 31, 2021 provided that the company files a proposal for the amendment of the settlement
agreement and it is admitted by the court before that date.

_Termination of the insolvency proceedings_

Article 465.6º of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law also foresees the termination of the insolvency proceeding at any
stage when it is proven that all credits have been paid, or that all creditors have been entirely satisfied by other means, or that
the situation of insolvency (i.e. the impossibility to face payment obligations regularly) has been overcome.

Finally, it must be noted that article 473 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law foresees the termination of the
insolvency proceeding at any time when assets are not enough to pay post-insolvency debt, as long as no future claw-back
actions are envisaged, nor actions claiming liability to third parties, nor the assessment of the proceeding as guilty.

**_Fraudulent Conveyance Laws_**

Under Spanish law, in addition to insolvency claw-back action, the insolvency administrator and any creditor may
bring an action to rescind a contract or agreement (acción rescisoria pauliana) against the debtor and the third-party which is
a party to such contract or agreement; provided that the same is performed or entered into fraudulently and the creditor cannot
obtain payment of the amounts owed in any other way. Although case law is not entirely consistent, it is broadly accepted that
the following requirements must be met in order for a creditor to bring such action:

     - the debtor owes the creditor an amount under a valid contract and the fraudulent action took place after such debt
was created;

     - the debtor has carried out an act that is detrimental to the creditor and beneficial to the third-party;

     - such act was fraudulent;


-----

     - there is no other legal remedy available to the creditor to obtain compensation for the damages suffered; and

     - debtor’s insolvency, construed as the situation where there has been a relevant decrease in the debtor’s estate
making it impossible or more difficult to collect the claim.

The existence of fraud (which must be evidenced by the creditor) is one of the essential requirements under Spanish
law for the action to rescind to succeed (as opposed to claw-back actions where the subjective component or fraud does not
have to be proven). Pursuant to article 1,297 of the Spanish Civil Code: (i) agreements by virtue of which the debtor transfers
assets for no consideration and (ii) transfers for consideration carried out by parties who have been held liable by a court
(sentencia condenatoria) or whose assets have been subject to a writ of attachment (mandamiento de embargo) will be
considered fraudulent. According to case law and most scholars, the presumption referred to in (i) above is a iuris et de iure
presumption (i.e., it cannot be rebutted by evidence), unlike the presumption indicated in (ii) above, which is a iuris tantum
presumption (i.e., it is a rebuttable presumption).

If the rescission action were to be upheld, the third-party would be liable to return to the debtor the consideration
received under the contract in order to satisfy the debt owed to the creditor. Following that, the creditor would need to carry
out the actions necessary to obtain the amount owed by the debtor. If the consideration received by the third-party under the
contract cannot be returned to the debtor, the third-party must indemnify the creditor for such damages.

**_Applicable Jurisdiction_**

Under both European and Spanish law, the applicable jurisdiction to conduct an insolvency proceeding is the one in
which the insolvent party has its “center of main interests” (“COMI”). This “center of main interests” is deemed to be where
the insolvent party conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which may be recognized as such by third
parties (although under European Union and Spanish law there is a rebuttable presumption that a debtor’s COMI is located
where its registered address is). Insolvency proceedings conducted by the court of the “center of main interests” are considered
“the principal insolvency proceedings” and have universal reach affecting all the assets of the insolvent party worldwide, with
certain exceptions, such as security interests over assets located outside of Spain. If the “center of main interests” is not in
Spain, but the insolvent party has a permanent establishment in Spain, Spanish courts will only have jurisdiction over the assets
located in Spain (the “territorial insolvency proceedings”).

In the event Spanish courts have jurisdiction, article 261 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law may apply, in which
case the claims of the beneficiaries of the guarantee provided by the Spanish Guarantor may be classified as “contingent”
claims and no amount may be recognized until and when a default occurs and the guarantee is validly enforced. Nor will they
have voting rights. Special rules can apply if the guarantee is not a first demand guarantee but an ordinary guarantee (fianza)
and, therefore, the benefits of preference (excusión), order (orden) and division (división) apply.

Please note that other jurisdictions outside the European Union do not require a COMI shift in order for a Spanish
company to make a filing in those jurisdictions (similarly as the UK concerning schemes of arrangements). Yet, recognition of
foreign insolvency proceedings not based on COMI or in a reasonable connection of an equivalent nature under the Spanish
Recast Insolvency Law should not be possible and, in addition, any creditor could file for a non-main insolvency proceeding
in Spain.

**England and Wales**

Certain of the subsidiary guarantors are companies incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Therefore, it is
likely that insolvency proceedings may be commenced against those companies in England.

However, after December 31, 2020, there exists the risk that the Courts of a Member State conclude that the relevant
subsidiary guarantor’s COMI is in that Member State (see “—The European Union and the _United Kingdom” above), leading_
to the possibility of competing insolvency proceedings in the United Kingdom and that Member State without the framework
of the Recast Insolvency Regulation to assist with the coordination and smooth facilitation of those proceedings. It is therefore
not possible to predict with certainty how any competing processes will be coordinated and how the rights of creditors may be
affected. In addition, if insolvency proceedings are commenced against the relevant subsidiary guarantor in the United
Kingdom, there is no longer automatic recognition of those proceedings in each Member State, meaning that the officeholder
of the proceeding in the United Kingdom is, in most cases, likely to have to seek recognition through the domestic laws of any
relevant Member State. It is not possible to predict with certainty whether recognition will be granted or, if recognition is
granted, the extent of the relief which will be provided by the Courts of the relevant Member State when granting recognition.


-----

English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may
be familiar. In the event that the English Guarantors experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty
the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings.

Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways, as follows.

**_Administration_**

Administration is an insolvency procedure under the IA86 pursuant to which a company may be reorganised or its
assets realised under the protection of a statutory moratorium.

There are two distinct methods for placing a company into administration: (i) an application to court followed by a
court order for administration (the “in-court route”); or (ii) the filing of certain prescribed forms with the court following which
the administration takes effect (the “out-of-court route”). The in-court route is commenced by an application to court by the
company itself, its directors, one or more of its creditors including contingent or prospective creditors, the U.K. Financial
Conduct Authority or the Prudential Regulation Authority or certain other designated persons. The out-of-court method of
appointment is available only to the directors, the company itself and the holder of a qualifying floating charge (“QFC”) (see
further below for the meaning of this term) and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointor.

A QFC is defined in paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 to the IA86 as being a floating charge created by an instrument
which: (i) states on its face that paragraph 14 applies to it; (ii) purports to empower the holder of the floating charge to appoint
an administrator of the company; or (iii) purports to empower the holder of the floating charge to appoint an administrative
receiver within the meaning given by section 29(2) of the IA86. A person is the holder of a QFC if he holds one or more
debentures of the company secured by charges and other forms of security, which together relate to the whole or substantially
the whole of the company’s property and at least one of which is a qualifying floating charge.

When any person other than a holder of a QFC makes an administration appointment (whether by the in-court or outof-court route), it will be necessary to show that the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts (see “—The
_Insolvency Test”). Regardless of how an administrator is appointed, he will need to consent to act as administrator and to state_
that, in his opinion, one of the following statutory objectives can be satisfied (the second objective can only be considered if
the first objective cannot be satisfied and the third objective only if the first two cannot be satisfied): (i) to rescue the company
as a going concern; (ii) to achieve a better result for creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up
without first being in administration; or (iii) to realise property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential
creditors (see “—Statutory order of priorities”).

An interim moratorium takes effect when an application to appoint an administrator is made or a notice of intention
to appoint an administrator is filed at court. Regardless of how the administration procedure is commenced, this becomes final
once the company is in administration. The moratorium means, among other things, that during the administration process no
other legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress or diligence) may be commenced or continued against the
company and no step can be taken to enforce security over the company’s property (in each case except with the consent of the
administrator or the permission of the court), no administrative receiver can be appointed and any receiver of part of the
company’s property will be required to resign if requested to do so by the administrator and, except in certain limited
circumstances, no resolution can be passed or order be made for the winding-up of the company. This moratorium does not
apply to financial collateral that has been created under a financial collateral arrangement within the meaning of the Financial
Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (as amended) (the “Financial Collateral Regulations”)
(generally, such arrangements are in respect of cash or financial instruments, such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market
debt instruments).

An administrator owes his duties to the creditors of the company as a whole. Upon appointment, he takes control of
the day-to-day running of the company and takes custody or control of all property, to which he thinks the company is entitled.
He has broad powers to deal with the company and its assets, except in respect of assets which are subject to fixed charge
security (where the consent of the holder of the relevant fixed charge is required in respect of any disposal of such assets). In
the absence of consent from the holder of the fixed charge, the permission of the court is required to dispose of any fixed
charge assets, which will only be granted if: (i) disposing of the assets in question is likely to promote the administration’s
purpose; and (ii) the net proceeds of sale (plus any additional amount required to be added to the net proceeds so as to produce
the amount determined by the court as the net amount which would be realised on a sale of the relevant assets for their market
value) are applied towards discharging the company’s obligations to the fixed charge holder. An administrator’s powers further
extend to investigating why the company failed and, where appropriate, bringing actions against the directors or former
directors or seeking to set aside certain transactions (see “—Antecedent Transaction Laws” in respect of the latter).


-----

An administration does not itself terminate any contracts and, unlike a liquidator, an administrator does not have the
power to disclaim or terminate contracts (although he can choose to breach a contract if he considers it to be in the best interests
of the creditors as a whole, in which case the resulting damages will rank as an unsecured debt, see “—Statutory Order of
_Priorities”). Conversely, contractual terms providing for automatic termination or a right of termination by the counterparty_
upon the occurrence of an insolvency event (such as administration) will generally be enforceable as they are not considered
to be against public policy as a matter of English law. However, there are exceptions to this general approach, most notably in
the context of contractual supplies of goods and services - counterparties may not terminate these contracts (or the supplies
they govern) or do any other thing (such as increase the pricing of the goods or services supplied under the contract) simply
because the company enters administration, except with the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court.

**_Administrative Receivership_**

A secured creditor may, in limited circumstances, be able to prevent the appointment of administrators by itself
appointing an administrative receiver prior to the appointment of any administrator. In order to empower a person to appoint
an administrative receiver to the company, the floating charge granted by the company to that person must constitute either: (i)
a floating charge over the whole (or substantially the whole) of the property of the company created before September 15, 2003;
or (ii) a QFC and the QFC must fall within one of the exceptions in the IA86 to the prohibition on the appointment of
administrative receivers. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver under
the IA86 is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the IA86), which will apply if the issue of
the notes creates a debt of at least £50,000,000 for the relevant company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement
involves the issue of a “capital market investment” (as defined in the IA86 but is generally a rated, listed or traded debt
instrument). If an administrative receiver has been appointed and is in office, an administrator can only be appointed by the
court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying charge using the out of court procedure), and then only
if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the
administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference, or a floating
charge (see “—Antecedent Transaction Laws”).

**_Liquidation/Winding-Up_**

Liquidation is a terminal insolvency process pursuant to which the assets of a company are realised by the liquidator
and the proceeds distributed to creditors in accordance with a statutory order of priority (see “—Statutory Order of Priorities”),
with any surplus paid to the shareholders. Once the liquidator has completed this task, the company will be dissolved and
removed from the register of companies.

There are two different types of liquidation: (i) compulsory; and (ii) voluntary, which is in turn divided into members’
voluntary liquidation (“MVL”) and creditors’ voluntary liquidation (“CVL”).

Regardless of how he is appointed, a liquidator owes his duties to the company and its creditors as a whole and has
wide powers to do whatever necessary for the conduct of the liquidation. This includes the power to: (i) agree, compromise and
pay creditor claims; (ii) sell any of the company’s property; (iii) bring or defend any legal proceedings on behalf of the
company; (iv) disclaim onerous property or contracts in accordance with section 178 of the IA86; (v) bring actions against the
directors or former directors; and (vi) bring actions to set aside certain transactions (see “—Antecedent Transaction Laws” in
respect of the latter).

In a compulsory liquidation, there is an automatic stay on proceedings being commenced or continued against the
company or its property except with the permission of the court. In a voluntary liquidation, there is no such automatic stay
although the court may, upon the application of the liquidator or any creditor, order a stay under its general discretionary power
in section 112 of the IA86.

**_Compulsory Liquidation_**

Compulsory liquidation is a court-based procedure pursuant to which a creditor (among others) petitions for the
winding up of a company and the court makes a winding up order. The grounds which entitle the court to make a winding up
order are set out in section 122 of the IA86. The most common grounds are that: (i) the company is unable to pay its debts (see
“—The Insolvency Test” for the meaning of this term); and (ii) the court is of the opinion that it is just and equitable for the
company to be wound up.

Under section 127 of the IA86, any disposition of the company’s property, any transfer of the company’s shares and
any altering of the status of company members is void if made following the “commencement of a winding up”, unless the


-----

court orders otherwise. If a winding up order is made, it is deemed to have commenced on the date on which the winding up
petition was presented. This gives section 127 retrospective effect, meaning that the company cannot enter into any of the
specified transactions during the period between the presentation of a winding up petition and the making of a winding up order
without first seeking a validation order from the court.

Pursuant to The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (“CIGA”) creditors are temporarily prevented from
the use of winding up petitions unless they have reasonable grounds to believe that COVID-19 has not had a financial impact
on the company or the grounds for the winding up petition would have applied even if COVID-19 had not had an effect on the
company. These restrictions are due to expire on June, 30 2021 (although such date may be extended at the discretion of the
UK Government).

**_Members’ Voluntary Liquidation_**

An MVL is a solvent liquidation that is controlled by the shareholders. It commences when the shareholders pass a
special resolution to place the company into liquidation and there is no involvement by the court. Not more than five weeks
prior to the making of the winding up resolution, the directors must swear a statutory declaration of solvency stating that, after
having made full enquiry into the company’s affairs, they have formed the opinion that it will be able to pay its debts, including
interest and the costs of the MVL process, within a stated period not exceeding 12 months from the start of the liquidation.

**_Creditors’ Voluntary Liquidation_**

A creditors’ voluntary liquidation is also commenced by the shareholders resolving to place the company into
liquidation and has no court involvement. In contrast to an MVL, however, the directors do not swear a statutory declaration
of solvency for a CVL (meaning the company can be solvent or insolvent) and, after the shareholders’ meeting, the creditors
are also given the opportunity to nominate their choice of liquidator. If the creditors choose a different person to act as liquidator
from the shareholders, the creditors’ choice will prevail.

**_The Insolvency Test_**

Under the IA86, a company is insolvent if it is unable to pay its debts. Under section 123 of the IA86, a company is
deemed unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that it is
unable to pay its debts as they fall due) which test can be demonstrated, for example, where a company fails to satisfy a
creditor’s statutory demand within three weeks for a debt exceeding £750 or if it fails to satisfy in full a judgment debt (or
similar court order), or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the value of
the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities).

**_Statutory Order of Priorities_**

One of the primary functions of liquidation (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going concern, one of the
possible functions of administration) under English law is to realise the assets of the insolvent company and to distribute
proceeds from such realization to its creditors. Under the IA86, creditors are placed into different classes and, with the
exceptions and adjustments noted below, the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in
descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions cannot
be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors
have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts
due to each creditor within a class.

The general priority of claims on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

_First ranking claims: holders of a fixed charge security and creditors with a proprietary interest in specific assets in_
the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor but only to the extent of the realizations from those
secured assets or with respect to the asset in which they have a proprietary interest;

_Second ranking claims: expenses of the insolvent estate incurred during the relevant insolvency proceedings, which_
include the remuneration of the officeholder (there is a further statutory order of priority setting out the order in which such
expenses are to be paid);


-----

_Third ranking claims: these are divided into ordinary preferential creditors and secondary preferential creditors with_
ordinary preferential creditors being paid in priority to secondary preferential creditors;

Ordinary preferential debts include debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (i) contributions to
occupational and state pension schemes; (ii) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the
insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person and (iii) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been
terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the insolvency date;

Secondary preferential debts include any amounts owed by the insolvent company in respect of certain prescribed
taxes (including VAT, PAYE and National Insurance Contributions);

_Fourth ranking claims: holders of a floating charge security to the extent of the realizations from those secured assets._
This would include any floating charge that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on a
proper interpretation, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating
charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below) must be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors;

_Fifth ranking claims: general unsecured creditors (save where such creditors are deferred). However, any secured_
creditor not repaid in full from the realization of assets subject to its security can also claim the remaining debt due to it (a
shortfall) from the insolvent estate as an unsecured claim; and

_Sixth ranking claims: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist,_
these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

Subordinated creditors will be ranked according to the terms of the subordination (provided that such terms do not
contravene the IA86).

**_Prescribed Part_**

An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of an English company will be required to
ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of assets subject to a floating charge security for the benefit of
unsecured creditors (the “Prescribed Part”). Under current law, this applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of net floating charge
realizations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, and the Prescribed Part is subject to a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000
(or in respect of floating charges created before April 6, 2020, £600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made available to
unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors. The Prescribed
Part will not be available for any shortfall claims of secured creditors unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all
unsecured creditors’ claims in full.

**_Foreign Currency_**

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claims for their debts, any debt
of a company payable in a currency other than sterling must be converted into sterling at the “official exchange rate” (which is
defined from time to time in the subordinate legislation of the IA86) prevailing at the date when the company went into
liquidation or administration. This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. Accordingly, in the event that a
company goes into liquidation or administration, holders of the notes may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date
that such company went into liquidation or administration and receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the notes may
become entitled (by way of a distribution in the liquidation or administration).

**_Part A1 Moratorium_**

CIGA introduced a new Part A1 into the IA86, which provides financially distressed companies (and some other
entities) with the option of obtaining a moratorium from enforcement action by certain types of creditors while they organise
their affairs to make their rescue viable. A moratorium for up to 40 business days in total can be obtained without creditor or
court consent. With creditor consent the moratorium can last for up to a year, or longer with a court order. Creditors are
prevented from taking most types of enforcement action against the company whilst the moratorium is in effect.

The company’s management remain in control of the company during the moratorium, subject to the oversight of a
‘monitor’, who scrutinises the company’s compliance with the terms of the moratorium and has the power to bring the
moratorium to an end if the company fails to comply with its requirements. Certain companies are however specifically


-----

excluded from utilising a moratorium, including companies which are party to a ‘capital market arrangement’ which involves
the issue of guaranteed or secured bonds of £10m or more in nominal value.

**_Schemes of Arrangement_**

Pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a compromise or
arrangement between a company and its creditors (or classes of creditors) where such company (i) is liable to be wound-up
under the IA86 and, in the context of a foreign company, (ii) has a “sufficient connection” to the English jurisdiction.

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed
compromise or arrangement in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be
affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be
proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing at least 75% in value of each class of creditors
present and voting at the creditor meeting(s) vote in favour of the proposed compromise, irrespective of the terms and approval
thresholds contained in the finance documents, that compromise will be binding on all affected creditors, including those
affected creditors who did not participate in the vote on the scheme of arrangement and those who voted against the scheme of
arrangement. In certain circumstances, a scheme of arrangement can also result in the release of guarantees in order to ensure
the effectiveness of the compromise. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court
will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has the discretion as to whether to
sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made to the scheme, or reject the scheme.

Schemes of arrangement have always been outside the scope of the Recast Insolvency Regulation on the basis that
they are not considered to be ‘insolvency’ proceedings (although they are, in practice, often used by financially distressed
companies). Instead, if a scheme previously required recognition within the EU, Regulation (EU) 1215/2012 of the European
_Parliament and of the Council on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial_
_matters (recast) (the “Brussels Regulation”) was relied upon as granting recognition of the judgment of the court sanctioning_
the scheme in each Member State.

The Brussels Regulation ceased to apply to the United Kingdom on December 31, 2020, meaning that an alternative
avenue of recognition for schemes is now required. Such avenues include recognition through the following instruments which,
together, provide that schemes should still be recognized in Member States notwithstanding that the United Kingdom no longer
benefits from the Brussels Regulation:

    - Lugano Convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters 2007
(“Lugano”): provides a framework for the recognition and enforcement of judgments (including those handed
down in relation to English schemes of arrangement). The general position under Lugano is that a defendant
domiciled in a jurisdiction which is a signatory to Lugano should be sued in the Courts of that jurisdiction, and
that judgments given in the Courts of a signatory shall be automatically registered and enforced in the Courts of
the other signatories. The United Kingdom was a signatory to Lugano by merit of its membership of the EU, and
therefore ceased to be a signatory on and from December 31, 2020. The United Kingdom however applied to be
re-admitted as a signatory in its own right on April 8, 2020. Whilst the United Kingdom’s application has not
been accepted as of the Issue Date, if its application is accepted, Lugano should provide an avenue for the
recognition and enforcement of judgments sanctioning schemes in the Courts of each other signatory.

    - Hague Convention of June 30, 2005 on Choice of Court Agreements (the “Hague Convention”): where parties
have stipulated an exclusive choice of court agreement in their contracts, the Hague Convention requires that the
parties’ decision and choice of court be respected. It further provides that any judgment rendered by the chosen
court will be recognized and enforced in other signatory states. Consequently, the Hague Convention may allow
for a scheme which seeks to compromise contractual arrangements which contain an exclusive choice of court
agreement in favour of the Courts of the United Kingdom to be recognised in other signatory states. The United
Kingdom ceased to be a signatory of the Hague Convention on December 31, 2020, but applied to be re-admitted
on September, 28 2020. Its application has not yet been accepted as of the Issue Date.

     - Bilateral treaties: some Member States have their own laws, or bilateral treaties with the UK, that might enable
recognition of an English scheme. However the number of these states is limited and the application of these laws
and treaties to schemes is untested.


-----

     - The Rome regulation on the law applicable to contractual obligations ((EC) No 593/2008) (“Rome I”): determines
the law governing contractual and non-contractual obligations and applies in all Member States (except
Denmark). Following December 31, 2020, Rome I will continue to be applicable in respect of recognition by
Member States (except Denmark) of judgments given in the Courts of the United Kingdom, allowing parties to
choose the law applicable to the contracts and agreements and for the choice of law to be respected in all Member
States. In the context of English law governed debt that is compromised under an English scheme, Rome I will
allow the relevant scheme / restructuring plan order to be recognized throughout the EU.

**_Restructuring Plans_**

CIGA introduced a new Part 26A into the Companies Act 2006 which allows a company to agree a compromise or
arrangement with its creditors (commonly known as a ‘restructuring plan’).

The process for a restructuring plan is closely modelled on the process for schemes of arrangement, with certain key
differences. Those differences are:

     - Restructuring plans are only available to companies that have encountered or are likely to encounter financial
difficulties that affect, or will or may affect, their ability to carry on business as a going concern.

     - Plan votes are calculated solely by the value of the relevant creditors' debt or members' shares (75% must vote in
favour). No numerosity requirement applies.

A dissenting class of voters cannot block the plan if the court is satisfied that:

     - none of the members of the dissenting class would be worse off than under the ‘relevant alternative’ (being the
most likely alternative outcome, in the court’s view, if the plan is not approved – in most cases, this will be
administration or liquidation); and

    - at least 75% by value of a class of creditors or members, which would receive a payment or have a genuine
economic interest if the relevant alternative were pursued, has still voted in favour of the plan.

A restructuring plan is therefore, in some respects, more flexible than a scheme because it enables a company to
propose a compromise or arrangement with its creditors which can be approved if only a single class of its creditors vote in
favour, provided that the above criteria are met. The plan is also subject to the same requirement as to fairness and
reasonableness as a scheme, providing creditors with an additional safeguard.

The Lugano Convention and the Hague Convention both contain exclusions whereby they are deemed to not apply to
judgments handed down in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. As the law currently stands, the Court of the United Kingdom
consider that restructuring plans fall within this exclusion due to the requirement that a company must have encountered or be
likely to encounter financial difficulties in order to propose a restructuring plan. Unlike schemes, restructuring plans therefore
fall outside the scope of the Lugano Convention and the Hague Convention. The recognition of a restructuring plan in Member
States therefore depends upon Rome I and/or the domestic laws of those Member States, and may be less straightforward than
the recognition of a scheme.

**_Company Voluntary Arrangements_**

Pursuant to Part I of the IA86, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator as applicable) may propose
a company voluntary arrangement which entails a compromise, or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors.
Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors voting by way of a decision procedure, it will bind
all unsecured creditors who were entitled to vote on the proposal (including any unsecured creditors who failed to vote or voted
against the company voluntary arrangement) A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured creditor to
enforce its security, except with its consent.

A company is eligible to propose a company voluntary arrangement proposal if it is: (a) a company registered under
the CA 2006 in England and Wales or Scotland; (b) a company incorporated in an EEA state, (c) a company not incorporated
in an EEA state but having its COMI in a member state other than Denmark or (d) a company with its COMI in the United
Kingdom (irrespective of where it is incorporated).


-----

In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to become binding, it must be approved by at least 75 per
cent (by value) of the company’s creditors who vote in the decision procedure, a majority (by value) of the company's members
and 50 per cent or more (by value) of unconnected creditors. Secured debt cannot be voted in a company voluntary arrangement.
However, a secured creditor may vote to the extent that it is undersecured (i.e. it may vote for any part of its debt which exceeds
the value of the assets which are secured in its favour). A secured creditor who proves in the company voluntary arrangement
for the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given up its security.

**_Enforceability of Guarantees_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting of guarantees by an English company
can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if the company is placed into administration or liquidation (as described
above) within a specified period of the granting of the guarantee. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or
liquidator is appointed to an English company, he may challenge the validity of the guarantee given by such guarantor in
circumstances where the company was “unable to pay its debts” when the guarantee was granted or became “unable to pay its
debts” as a result.

If the guarantees or other intercompany obligations granted by an English subsidiary guarantor are challenged under
the laws of England and Wales, and the court makes certain findings, it may be permitted to: (i) avoid or invalidate all or a
portion of an English guarantor’s obligations under the guarantee provided by such English guarantor; (ii) direct that the holders
of the Notes return any amounts paid by an English guarantor under a guarantee to the relevant English guarantor or to a fund
for the benefit of the English guarantor’s creditors; and/or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to the holders of the Notes.

The following potential grounds for challenge may apply to guarantees or security interests.

**_Antecedent Transaction Laws_**

There are five principal provisions of the IA86 under which transactions entered into prior to a company’s insolvency
can be challenged. They are: (i) transactions at an undervalue (section 238); (ii) preferences (section 239); (iii) avoidance of
certain floating charges (section 245); (iv) transactions defrauding creditors (section 423); and (v) extortionate credit
transactions (section 244).

These provisions all apply where the company has gone into liquidation or administration, with the exception of
section 423 which applies even if the company is not in insolvency proceedings.

**_Transactions at an Undervalue_**

Under the IA86, a liquidator or administrator of a company could apply to the court for an order to set aside the
creation of a security interest (in certain cases) or a guarantee granted by the company (or give other relief) if such liquidator
or administrator believes that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue.

A transaction will constitute a transaction at an undervalue if: (i) the transaction is at an undervalue (a gift or a
transaction on terms that provide for the company to receive no consideration or a transaction for a consideration the value of
which (in money or money’s worth) is significantly less than the value (in money or money’s worth) of the consideration
provided by the company); (ii) the transaction took place within the relevant time (2 years before the onset of insolvency, being
broadly the commencement of its liquidation or administration); and (iii) the company was at the time of the transaction, or
became, as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts (as defined in the IA86).

A court generally will not intervene if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for
the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction
would benefit it. Subject to this, if the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court can
make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into
(which could include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside any security interests or guarantees granted). In
any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the company was unable to pay its debts unless a
beneficiary of the transaction was a “connected person” (as defined in the IA86), in which case there is a presumption that the
company was unable to pay its debts and the connected person must demonstrate the company was not unable to pay its debts
at the time of the transaction, in such proceedings. An order by the court for a transaction at an undervalue may affect the
property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not he is the person with whom the company entered into the
transaction, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the
company in good faith and for value, or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who


-----

received a benefit from the transaction in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company,
except where that person was a party to the transaction.

**_Preferences_**

Under the IA86, a liquidator or administrator of a company could apply to the court for an order to set aside the
creation of a security interest or a guarantee granted by such company (or give other relief) if such liquidator or administrator
believes that the creation of such security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference.

A company gives a preference to a person if: (i) that person is one of the company’s creditors, a surety or a guarantor
for any of the company’s debts or other liabilities; (ii) the company has done something (such as the granting of a security
interest or guarantee), or has suffered something to be done which (in either case) has had the effect of putting that person into
a position which, in the event that the company goes into insolvent liquidation, will be better than the position he would have
been in if that thing had not been done; (iii) the company was influenced in deciding to give the preference by a desire to put
the creditor in a better position than he would have been in if the thing had not been done or suffered to be done (this desire is
rebuttably presumed in the case of connected persons); (iv) the preference was given within the relevant time (6 months before
the onset of the insolvency or 2 years from the onset of insolvency where the transaction is with a connected person); and (v)
the company was at the time of the transaction, or became as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts (as defined in
the IA86).

Subject to this, if the court determines that a transaction was a preference, the court can make such order as it thinks
fit to restore the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given (which could include the releasing
of a security interest or guarantee granted by the company under such transaction). An order by the court for a preference may
affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not he is the person to whom the preference was
given, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company
in good faith and for value, or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received
a benefit from the preference in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except
where the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to that person at a time when he was a creditor of the company.

The desire to prefer requires a “positive wish to improve the creditor’s position in the event of the company’s insolvent
liquidation” (Re Fairway Magazines Ltd 1993 BCLC 643). A preferential effect for a creditor may be foreseen by the company
without being desired. Where a company is influenced by “proper commercial considerations” there will be no desire to prefer
and therefore no voidable preference (MC Bacon 1990 BCLC 324).

**_Voidable Floating Charges_**

Under the IA86, a floating charge created by a company over its property may be invalid if it was created in the
relevant time. Where the transaction is with a connected person, this means within a period of 2 years before the onset of
insolvency. In all other cases, this means within a period of 12 months before the onset on insolvency when the company was
at the time of the transaction, or became as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts (as defined in the IA86).

This is the only requirement for setting aside the floating charge and, if met, the security is automatically invalid
except to the extent of the aggregate of the value of so much of the consideration for the creation of the charge (as consists of
money paid, goods or services supplied or debts discharged and interest thereon) supplied to the company at the time of, or
after the creation of, the charge. No court action is required save for in respect of the officeholder of a foreign proceeding
recognised under the CBIR who wishes to apply for standing to challenge a voidable floating charge.

Section 245 of the IA86 does not apply to a floating charge that has been created under a financial collateral
arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Regulations.

**_Transactions Defrauding Creditors_**

Under the IA86, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue (as outlined above) and was made for
the purposes of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against a company, or of
otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim which that person is making or may make, the transaction
may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. This provision may be used by any person who claims to be
a “victim” of the transaction and is not therefore limited to liquidators or administrators. There is no time limit in the English
insolvency legislation within which the company must enter insolvency proceedings and the relevant company does not need
to have been unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction (although general statutory limitation periods will apply). If


-----

the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit
to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the
victims of the transaction (including reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside the security interests or
guarantees) but there is protection for a third party acting in good faith and for value without notice of the relevant
circumstances. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he
is the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property
which was acquired from a third party in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, or prejudice
any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good
faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, to pay any sum unless such person was a party to the
transaction.

**_Extortionate Credit Transactions_**

If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has entered into an extortionate credit transaction, the court
may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside.

A transaction is extortionate if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, either: (i) its
terms require (or required) grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in
respect of the provision of the credit; or (ii) it otherwise grossly contravenes (or contravened) ordinary principles of fair dealing.

The court can make an order in relation to extortionate credit transactions entered into by the company up to three
years before the day on which the company entered into administration or went into liquidation.

**_Additional Considerations_**

_Post-petition interest_

Any interest accruing under or in respect of amounts due under the notes to which an English company is a party in
respect of any period after the commencement of administration or liquidation proceedings would only be recoverable by the
holders of the notes from any surplus remaining after payment of all other debts proved in the English company’s insolvency
proceedings and accrued and unpaid interest up to the date of the commencement of those proceedings, provided that such
interest may, if there are sufficient realisations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries in respect
of debts secured by those assets.

_Dispositions in winding-up_

Under section 127 of the IA86, any disposition of a company’s property made after a winding-up has commenced is,
unless the court orders otherwise, void. The compulsory winding-up of a company by the court is deemed to start when a
winding-up petition is presented by a creditor against the company, rather than the date on which the court makes the windingup order (if any). However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or otherwise arising
under a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting
provision taking effect in accordance with its terms.

_Disclaimer_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator (but not an administrator) has the power to disclaim any onerous property,
which is any unprofitable contract and any other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to
a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities
and imposes continuing financial obligations on the company that may be detrimental to creditors. However, this power does
not apply to an executed contract nor can it be used to disturb accrued rights and liabilities.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS**

_The Issuer is incorporated in the Netherlands and Guarantors are organized under the laws of Italy, Germany, Spain,_
_France, the Netherlands and England & Wales, as applicable and future Guarantors may also be organized under the laws of_
_non-U.S. jurisdictions. All of our directors and executive officers and many of the directors and officers of the Guarantors are_
_non-residents of the United States. Although we and each of the Guarantors have submitted to the jurisdiction of certain New_
_York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the_
_United States on our directors and executive officers and the directors and executive officers of the Guarantors or security_
_providers. In addition, as many of our and the Guarantors’ assets and the assets of our and their directors and executive officers_
_are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce against them or us judgments obtained in the U.S. courts_
_predicated on civil liability provisions of the Federal securities laws of the United States._

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against us or a Guarantor or a security provider, investors will need to enforce
such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S. court judgments
outside the United States is described below for the countries in which our Guarantors are located, you should consult with
your own advisers in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the
United States.

**The Netherlands**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors (the "Dutch Guarantors") are incorporated under Dutch law and have their
registered seat in the Netherlands. Civil liabilities based on the securities laws of the United States may not be enforceable in
the Netherlands, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. courts.

The United States and the Netherlands currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for
payment given by any court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not be
enforceable in the Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must be relitigated before a competent Dutch court. A Dutch court will, under current practice, generally grant the same judgment without
relitigation analysis on the merits if (i) the foreign court rendering that judgment has jurisdiction over the matter on
internationally acceptable grounds and has conducted the proceedings in accordance with generally accepted principles of fair
trial, (ii) that judgment does not contravene public policy (openbare orde) of the Netherlands, (iii) the foreign judgment is not
in conflict with a decision rendered by a Dutch court between the same parties, or with an earlier judgment rendered by a
foreign court in proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties, provided that the earlier decision
can be recognized in the Netherlands, and (iv) the foreign judgment is—according to the law of its country of origin—final and
conclusive in such a way that all appeals have been exhausted and no other remedy could be obtained from a competent judicial
body have been exhausted and no other remedy could be obtained from a competent judicial body.

Subject to the foregoing and provided that service of process occurs in accordance with applicable treaties, investors
may be able to enforce in the Netherlands judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts.
However, no assurance can be given that such judgments will be enforceable. In addition, it is doubtful whether a Dutch court
would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action commenced in the Netherlands and predicated solely
upon U.S. federal securities laws.

Any enforcement of agreements governed by foreign law and any foreign judgments in the Netherlands will be subject
to the rules of Dutch civil procedure. Judgments may be rendered in a foreign currency but enforcement is executed in euros at
the applicable rate of exchange. Enforcement of obligations in the Netherlands will be subject to the nature of the remedies
available in the courts of the Netherlands. Under certain circumstances, a Dutch court has the power to stay proceedings
(aanhouden) or to declare that it has no jurisdiction, if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere.

A Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent
that they are necessary to compensate actual losses and damages.

**France**

Our French counsel has advised us that the United States and France are not party to a treaty providing for reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters.


-----

Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated
solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, enforceable in the United States, would not directly be recognized or
enforceable in France. A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur)
in France before the relevant civil court (tribunal judiciaire). Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained
following proper (i.e., non-ex parte) proceedings if the civil court is satisfied that the following conditions have been met
(which conditions, under prevailing French case law, do not include a review by the French court of the merits of the foreign
judgment):

     - such U.S. judgment is final and enforceable in the jurisdiction of the court which rendered it;

     - the subject matter of such U.S. judgment is sufficiently or substantially connected with the jurisdiction of the
court that rendered it, the choice of the U.S. court was not fraudulent and French courts did not have exclusive
jurisdiction to hear the matter;

     - such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both pertaining to the merits
and the procedure of the case;

     - such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud; and

     - such U.S. judgment does not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment that has become effective in
France and there is no risk of conflict with proceedings pending before French courts at the time enforcement of
the judgment is sought.

If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit from the res judicata
effect as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus be declared enforceable in France. However, the
decision granting the exequatur is subject to appeal. In principle, the appeal proceedings has no suspensive effect (i.e.: the
Judgement will be enforceable notwithstanding the appeal). The claimant is however allowed to file a request before the 1st
President of the Court of appeal in order to seek the freezing the enforcement of the exequatur judgement pending the outcome
of the appeal proceedings).

In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under certain
circumstances by French law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French laws No. 80-538 of July 16, 1980 and
No. 2000-916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to the communication of documents and information of an economic,
commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining
evidence in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Pursuant to the
regulations above, the U.S. authorities would have to comply with international (the 1970 Hague Convention on the Taking of
Evidence Abroad) and French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France or from French persons. Similarly, French data
protection rules (law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data files and individual liberties, as most recently
modified by law No. 2014-344 of March 17, 2014) can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining
information in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action in a discovery context.

We have been advised by our French counsel that if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse
to apply foreign law (or part of foreign law) as designated by the applicable French rules of conflict or as chosen by the parties
to govern their contract if its application is deemed to contravene French international public policy (as determined on a caseby-case basis by French courts) or in case of overriding mandatory rules. In an action brought in France on the basis of U.S.
federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought.

Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual) may decide to
bring an action before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the foreign defendant in
France with a French person or in a foreign country with a French person. Pursuant to Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a
French national can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations
contracted by the French national in a foreign country with the foreign claimant. These provisions also apply in the context of
non-contractual obligations. For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French national, either
claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than French courts. However,
according to case law from 2006 and 2007, the French courts’ jurisdiction over French nationals is no longer mandatory to the
extent an action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction that has sufficient contacts with the dispute and the choice
of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. More specifically, according to this case law, a French defendant can no longer challenge the
jurisdiction of a foreign court on the basis of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code in circumstances where the foreign


-----

court has otherwise jurisdiction. In addition, French and foreign claimants may waive his or her rights respectively to benefit
from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including by way of conduct by voluntarily appearing
before the foreign court.

In a decision dated September 26, 2012, the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) held that a contractual
provision submitting one party to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the discretionary option to
choose any competent jurisdiction was invalid on the ground that it was discretionary (potestative). In a decision dated
25 March 2015, the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) reversed the decision of the Angers Court of Appeal, stating
that it should have examined whether the one-sided jurisdiction clause which did not set out an objective basis for the alternative
jurisdictions that one party could choose, wasn’t contrary to the Lugano Convention’s objectives of predictability and legal
certainty (which, so far as relevant, is the same as the Brussels I Regulation). Accordingly, any provisions to the same effect in
any relevant documents would not be binding on the party submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court or prevent a
French party from bringing an action before the French courts. On the other hand, a provision which allows to identify the
alternative forum in which a potential dispute could be brought will be upheld.

**Germany**

The United States and Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement
of court judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final and conclusive
judgment by any U.S. federal or state court for payment based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S.
federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. A final judgment by a U.S. federal or state
court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action of exequatur before a court of competent jurisdiction
in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action,
a German court generally would not reinvestigate and review the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except
as noted below. The recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a German court would be conditional upon a number
of factors, including but not limited to the following:

     - the judgment being final under U.S. federal or state law;

     - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original in accordance with the principles of jurisdictional
competence of German law;

     - the defendant having had the chance to defend herself or himself against an unduly or untimely served complaint;

     - the judgment was not given in default of appearance and the defendant invokes such default or the defendant was
not served with the document which instituted the proceedings properly or within sufficient time to enable him to
arrange for his or her defence;

     - the judgment is not irreconcilable with a judgment given in Germany or a previous, recognizable foreign judgment
recognition in Germany or the proceedings leading to such judgment are irreconcilable with proceedings that
were filed (rechtshängig) in Germany previously;

     - the judgment of the U.S. court not being consistent with the judgment of a German court or a recognized judgment
of a foreign court handed down before the judgment of the U.S. court;

     - the enforcement of the judgment by the U.S. court being compatible with the substantial foundations of German
law (e.g. ordre public), including without limitation, fundamental rights (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of
the German Basic Law (Grundgesetz); and

     - generally, the guarantee of reciprocity.

Enforcement and foreclosure based on U.S. judgments may be sought against German defendants after having received
an enforcement or exequatur decision from a competent German court in accordance with the above principles. Subject to the
foregoing, purchasers of securities may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal
or state courts in Germany. We cannot, however, assure you that attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful
under all circumstances. In particular, the remedies need to be of a specific kind and type for which an enforcement procedure
exists under German law. Also, if circumstances have arisen after the date on which such foreign judgment became res judicata,
a defence against execution may arise.


-----

If an original action is brought before a German court, and the court does not decline jurisdiction, the court may apply
not only EU and German rules of civil procedure, but also certain substantive provisions of the EU and German law that are
regarded as mandatory and may refuse to apply U.S. law provisions, particularly those relating to certain remedies, if the
relevant application violates German public policy.

In particular, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages is usually denied by German courts as incompatible
with the substantial foundations of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a
U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages.

Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation or
moratorium as well as other similar laws affecting creditor’s rights generally.

German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. With respect to the
production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common
law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of
documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the
outcome of any proceeding. No such pre- trial discovery process exists under German law.

**Republic of Italy**

We have been advised by counsel in the Republic of Italy that the recognition and enforcement of a judgment rendered
by a U.S. federal or New York state court in the Republic of Italy is governed by Article 64 of the Private International Law
Act (i.e., Law 218 of May 31, 1995) (the “PIL Act”) (and certain other provisions of the PIL Act). Pursuant to the PIL Act, any
judgment issued by a U.S. federal or New York state court should automatically be recognized in the Republic of Italy provided
that the following requirements are met:

     - the relevant U.S. federal or New York state court had appropriate jurisdiction to pass judgment upon the matter
(in accordance with the Italian law rules on jurisdiction);

    - the defendant had received the summons and complaint in accordance with the laws of the state in which the
proceedings have taken place, and the defendant had not been deprived of its fundamental right to a defense;

     - the parties had appeared in the proceedings in accordance with the local procedural law, or the proceedings were
conducted in absentia (in contumacia) in accordance with such local procedural law;

     - the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or New York state court must be final and binding (passato in giudicato)
according to the law of the state in which it was issued;

     - the final judgment (sentenza passato in giudicato) rendered by the U.S. federal or New York state court is not in
conflict with any earlier final and binding judgment issued by an Italian court;

     - there is no pending proceeding before any Italian court in relation to the same subject matter and between the
same parties which started prior to the commencement of the proceedings before the relevant U.S. federal or New
York state court; and

     - the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or New York state court is not contrary to Italian public policy (ordine
_pubblico)._

In addition, according to Article 67 of the PIL Act, if a judgment rendered by a U.S. federal or New York state court
is not complied with, its recognition is challenged or it is necessary to enforce such judgment, a proceeding must be instituted
in the competent Court of Appeal in the Republic of Italy to that end. The competent Court of Appeal does not consider the
merits of the case but reviews exclusively the existence of all the requirements set out above (including requiring that the
judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or New York state court is not contrary to public policy in Italy).

Please note that awards of punitive damages in actions brought in the United States or elsewhere may not be
enforceable in Italy.


-----

In addition to the foregoing, in original actions brought before Italian courts to enforce the civil liability provisions of
the securities laws of the United States, an Italian court will examine the claims in accordance with Italian rules of civil
procedure and could apply U.S. substantive laws; however, even though such an Italian court could apply U.S. substantive law,
it might (i) refuse to apply U.S. law provisions or to grant some of the remedies sought (for example punitive damages) if their
application violates Italian public policy and mandatory provisions of Italian law and (ii) apply certain domestic provisions of
substantive Italian law that are regarded as mandatory provisions in an international context. In original actions brought before
Italian courts there is doubt as to the enforceability of liabilities or remedies based on U.S. securities law.

**Spain**

A final judgment obtained against us outside of Spain (and, in particular, in the United States), other than a country
bound by the provisions of EU Regulation 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council, would be recognized and
enforced by the courts of Spain (unless such judgment contravenes principles of Spanish public policy rules –orden público-)
pursuant to the following regimes:

     - according to the provisions of any applicable treaty (there being none currently in existence between Spain and
the United States for these purposes); and

     - in the absence of any such treaty, the judgment would be enforced in Spain if it satisfies all of the following
requirements in compliance with and subject to Article 523 of the Spanish Civil Procedure Act (Ley 1/2000, de 7
_de enero de Enjuiciamiento Civil) and subject to Act 29/2015, of July 30, on International Legal Cooperation in_
Civil Matters (Ley 29/2015, de 30 de julio, de Cooperación Jurídica Internacional en materia civil) (the “Act on
**International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters”):**

`o` such U.S. judgment is final and conclusive (firme);

`o` such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter since the dispute is
clearly connected to the United States and the choice of the court is not fraudulent;

`o` such U.S. judgment does not contravene Spanish public policy rules or mandatory provisions, and
the obligation to be fulfilled is legal in Spain;

`o` the documentation prepared for the purposes of requesting the enforcement is accompanied by a
literal, authentic, sworn Spanish translation;

`o` the copy of the judgment presented before the Spanish Court is duly apostilled;

`o` there is not a pending previous proceedings between the same parties and in relation to the same
issues in Spain;

`o` there is no material contradiction or incompatibility of such U.S. judgment with a judgment rendered
or judicial proceedings outstanding in Spain, or a judgment previously rendered in another country when this
last judgment meets the requirements to be eventually recognized in Spain;

`o` where rendering the judgment, the courts rendering it did not infringe an exclusive ground of
jurisdiction provided for under Spanish law or based their jurisdiction on exorbitant grounds and the choice
of court is not fraudulent;

`o` the rights of defense of the defendant were protected where rendering the judgment, including, but
not limited to, a proper service of process carried out with sufficient time for the defendant to prepare its
defense and the U.S. judgment was not rendered by default (i.e., without appearance or without the possibility
to appear for the defendant); and

`o` although reciprocity is not a legal requirement, if it were proven that the U.S. jurisdiction in which
the judgment was obtained does not recognize judgments issued by Spanish courts on a general basis, then
the Spanish courts could be compelled to deny the recognition of the U.S. judgment in Spain.


-----

It is important to note that the Act on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters expressly prohibits that a foreign
judgment is reviewed as to its substance (revision del fondo) by the Spanish competent court.

The United States and Spain are not party to any treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, any party wishing to have a U.S.
ruling recognized or enforced in Spain must file an application seeking declaration of enforceability of the U.S. resolution
(exequatur) with the relevant Spanish Court of First Instance (Juzgado de Primera Instancia) or Commercial Court (Juzgado
_de lo Mercantil)._

The Spanish courts may express any such order in a currency other than Euro in respect of the amount due and payable
by Adevinta Spain, but in case of enforcement in Spain, the court costs (costas judiciales) and interest will be paid in euros.
Any judgment obtained against the Adevinta Spain in any country bound by the provisions of EU Regulation 1215/2012 of the
European Parliament and of the Council would be recognized and enforced in accordance with the terms set forth thereby.

The enforcement of any judgment in Spain entails, among others, the following actions and costs:

    - translation fees for documents in a language other than Spanish, which must be accompanied by a sworn
translation into Spanish (translator’s fees will be payable);

     - certain professional fees for the verification of the legal representative of a party litigating in Spain (if needed);

     - payment of certain court costs and fees;

     - the procedural acts of a party litigating in Spain must be directed by an attorney at law and the party must be
represented by a court agent (procurador); and

     - the contents and validity of foreign law must be evidenced to the Spanish courts.

Moreover, please note that Spanish civil proceedings rules cannot be amended by agreement of the parties and will,
therefore, prevail notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Notes.

Notwithstanding the parties’ choice of foreign jurisdiction, the Spanish courts may in certain circumstances, including
where considerations of Spanish public policy rules require it, take jurisdiction or grant ancillary relief in relation to proceedings
commenced in a foreign court (including the chosen court).

If an original action is brought in Spain, Spanish courts may refuse to apply the designated law if its application
contravenes Spanish public policy. Pursuant to Article 54 of the current Spanish Civil Procedure Act, the parties to an agreement
are entitled to clearly agree on their submission to a particular judge (juzgado) or court (tribunal) provided that, under the
Spanish Civil Procedure Act and the Spanish Judicial Act (Ley 6/1985, de 1 de Julio, Orgánica del Poder Judicial), the relevant
judge or court is competent to solve the relevant dispute; therefore such article does not cover the validity of non-exclusive
jurisdiction clauses, at least for conflicts between different Spanish courts.

**England and Wales**

The United States and England and Wales do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal enforcement of court
judgments in civil and commercial matters. In order to enforce a US judgment against a judgment debtor in England & Wales
it would be necessary to bring a new claim (or counterclaim) in England & Wales to sue on the implied contract to pay created
by the US judgment. Such a claim (or counterclaim) would be likely to succeed, provided that:

     - the court in which the original judgment was given had jurisdiction according to the English rules of the conflict
of laws;

     - the judgment was not obtained in breach of an agreement that relevant disputes would be determined otherwise
than by a court in the relevant US state;

     - the judgment was final and conclusive;


-----

     - the judgment was for a fixed sum of money and not directly or indirectly in respect of penal laws, taxes, fines,
penalties or multiple (punitive) damages nor based on a public law of a foreign state;

     - the judgment was not obtained in a manner contrary to the rules of natural justice or by fraud;

     - the judgment does not conflict with a prior judgment of the courts of England and Wales or another court whose
judgment is entitled to recognition in England and Wales;

     - enforcement proceedings are not time barred under the Limitation Act 1980 or otherwise; and

     - the judgment is not otherwise contrary to English public policy and does not violate the Human Rights Act 1998.

A court in England & Wales would not generally reinvestigate or review the merits of the underlying claim decided
by a U.S. court, except insofar as necessary to determine the defences described above. There is no requirement that a judgment
from England and Wales would be enforceable in the US state where judgment was obtained. Provided that there is no arguable
case that any of the above defences apply, the judgment creditor may be able to obtain summary judgment on the basis that the
judgment debtor has no reasonable prospect of defending the claim.

Once judgment has been obtained in a court of England and Wales in the manner described above, it would then be
possible to enforce that judgment against the judgment debtor’s assets in England & Wales in the same way and to the same
extent as any other judgment of a court of England & Wales.

**ANNEX A—SUMMARY OF CERTAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN IFRS AND U.S. GAAP**

This offering memorandum contains historical financial information derived from the Audited Combined Financial
Statements and the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements and notes thereto.

The matters described below summarize certain differences between IFRS and US GAAP that may be material to the
financial information included in this offering memorandum. We have not prepared a qualitative or quantitative reconciliation
of our combined financial statements and related footnote disclosure between IFRS and US GAAP; accordingly, we cannot
assure you that this summary is complete. In making an investment decision, you must rely upon your examination of the
Group and the financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. You should consult your own professional
advisers for an understanding of the differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP and how those differences might affect the
financial information included in this offering memorandum.

The differences highlighted below reflect only those differences in accounting policies in force at the time of the
preparation of the above mentioned audited combined financial statements. No attempt has been made to identify future
differences between IFRS and US GAAP, as the result of prescribed changes in accounting standards, transactions or events
that may occur in the future. Future developments or changes in IFRS and U.S. GAAP may give rise to additional differences
between IFRS and US GAAP, which could have a significant impact on the Group.

**Revenue recognition**

**IFRS**

Revenue is recognized following the five-step model:

(a) Identify the contract;

(b) Identify performance obligations;

(c) Determine transaction price;

(d) Allocate transaction price; and

(e) Recognize revenue at a point-in-time or over-time.

Revenue related to shipping and handling services should be analyzed to determine whether they give rise to a separate
performance obligation. Entities must also evaluate each type of tax on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis to determine which
amounts to exclude from revenue (as amounts collected on behalf of third parties) and which amounts to include.

**US GAAP**

Revenue recognition under U.S. GAAP is similar to IFRS, with the exception of a few discrete areas such as
collectability threshold, non-cash consideration and definition of completed contract. U.S. GAAP also allows entities to elect
to account for shipping and handling activities that occur after the customer has obtained control of a good as a fulfillment cost
rather than an additional promised service and to make an accounting policy election to present all taxes collected from
customers on a net basis.

**Fixed assets**

**a.** **Goodwill**

**IFRS**

Goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest
recognized and the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.

A-1

Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually at
the lowest level within the entity at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes provided that level is not
larger than an operating segment as defined by IFRS.

Under IFRS, Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if an event occurs to indicate
an impairment. The Goodwill impairment test is performed using a one-step approach and the recoverable amount of the CGU
is compared to carrying amount with the impairment loss recognised in operating results as excess of carrying amount over the
recoverable amount.

**US GAAP**

Similar to IFRS, business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method, with limited exceptions, and
annual impairment testing is required for goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life. Goodwill is assigned
to an entity’s reporting units (RUs), defined as the same as, or one level below, an operating segment. The determination of
reporting units is based on a segment reporting structure.

Under US GAAP, Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if an event occurs to
indicate an impairment. With the adoption of ASU 2017-04, the requirement for step 2 of the goodwill impairment test is
removed. The goodwill impairment amount is the excess of carrying value over fair value of the reporting entity, not to exceed
the carrying amount of goodwill.

U.S GAAP also provides private companies with the option of amortizing goodwill on a straight-line basis over a
period not to exceed ten years.

**b.** **Capitalisation of development costs**

**IFRS**

Under IFRS, costs associated with the creation of intangible assets are classified into research phase costs and
development phase costs. Costs in the research phase are always expensed. Costs in the development phase are capitalized, if
certain six criteria are met, including: the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset; the intention to complete the
intangible asset; the ability to use or sell the intangible asset; how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic
benefits (the entity should demonstrate the existence of a market or, if for internal use, the usefulness of the intangible asset);
the availability of adequate resources to complete the development and to use or sell it; the ability to measure reliably the
expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. Development costs initially recognized as expenses
cannot be capitalized in a subsequent period.

**US GAAP**

Under US GAAP, generally, both research costs and development costs are expensed as incurred, except that the
treatment of costs associated with the development of software for sale to third Parties or with the development of software for
internal use may be recognized.

**c.** **Property, plant, and equipment — Depreciation**

**IFRS**

IFRS requires that separate significant components of property, plant, and equipment with different economic lives
be recorded and depreciated separately. The guidance requires entities to review residual values and useful lives, at a minimum,
at each balance sheet date.

**US GAAP**

US GAAP generally does not require the component approach for depreciation. While it would generally be expected
that the appropriateness of significant assumptions within the financial statements would be reassessed each reporting period,
there is no explicit requirement for an annual review of residual values.

d. **Spare parts**

A-2


-----

**IFRS**

Under IFRS, items such as spare parts, stand-by equipment and servicing equipment should be recognised as PP&E
when they meet the definition of property, plant and equipment (held for use in the production or supply of goods or services,
for rental to others, or for administrative purposes and expected to be used during more than one period). Otherwise, such items
are classified as inventory.

**US GAAP**

Under U.S. GAAP, there is no explicit guidance for accounting for spare parts and there could be a diversity in practice
on how to account for them.

**Consolidation and investment in non-consolidated subsidiaries**

**IFRS**

Under IFRS, an investee shall be consolidated where it is controlled by the investor which requires exposure or rights
to variable returns and the ability to affect those returns through power over an investee. This definition allows for situations
such as de-facto control, in which is possible to control entities even owning less than 50% of the ownership interest.

IFRS requires uniform accounting policy between the parent and subsidiary. IFRS permits the reversal of impairment
of equity method investment. IFRS does not permit recognition of losses in excess of investment (except when the entity has
incurred a legal or constructive obligation)

**US GAAP**

All consolidation decisions are evaluated first under the Variable Interest Entity (VIE) model. U.S. GAAP requires an
entity with a variable interest in a VIE to qualitatively assess the determination of the primary beneficiary of the VIE. In
applying the qualitative model, an entity is deemed to have a controlling financial interest if it meets both of the following
criteria:

       - Power to direct activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance (power
criterion)

       - Obligation to absorb losses from or right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant
to the VIE (losses/benefits criterion)

There is no requirement for uniform accounting policy between the parent and subsidiary. Reversal of impairment on
equity method investments is not permitted. US GAAP permits recognition of loss in excess of investment amount when the
imminent return to profitability by the investee is assured.

**Long term financial assets**

**IFRS**

Financial assets are classified into three specific categories based on their main characteristics:

1. Amortised cost;

2. FVOCI;

3. FVTPL.

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost only if it meets both of the following conditions:

     - The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows (the
held-to-collect business model);

A-3


-----

     - The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (the SPPI criterion).

A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions:

     - The asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows
and selling financial assets;

     - The contractual terms of the financial asset meet the SPPI criterion.

All other financial assets (i.e. financial assets that do not meet the criteria for classification as subsequently measured
at either amortised cost or FVOCI) are classified as subsequently measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised
in profit or loss (FVTPL).

In addition, an entity has the option on initial recognition to irrevocably designate a financial asset as at FVTPL if
doing so eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency (i.e. an “accounting mismatch”) that
would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities, or recognizing the gains and losses on them, on different basis.

**US GAAP**

The classification and accounting treatment of loans and receivables generally depends on whether the asset in
question meets the definition of a debt security under ASC 320. To meet the definition of a security under ASC 320, the asset
is required to be of a type commonly available on securities exchanges or in markets, or, when represented by an instrument,
is commonly recognized in any area in which it is issued or dealt in as a medium for investment.

Loans and receivables that are not within the scope of ASC 320 fall within the scope of other guidance, such as ASC
310, Receivables. Loans are generally:

     - Classified as loans held for investment, in which case they are measured at amortized cost;

     - Classified as loans held for sale, in which case they are measured at the lower of cost or fair value (market); or

     - Carried at fair value if the fair value option is elected.

Under US GAAP, the legal form of a debt instrument primarily drives classification. For example, available-for-sale
debt instruments that are securities in legal form are typically carried at fair value, even if there is no active market to trade the
securities. At the same time, a debt instrument that is not in the form of a security (for example, a corporate loan) is accounted
for at amortized cost even though both instruments (i.e., the security and the loan) have similar economic characteristics.

**Financial assets - Impairment**

**IFRS**

IFRS 9 introduced an expected loss model for financial assets. The overall model applies to assets at amortized cost
and FVOCI. The model is forward looking and incorporates historical information, current information, and reasonable and
supportable forecasts of future conditions. For those financial instruments that have not had a significant increase in credit risk
(SICR) since initial recognition or that have low credit risk at the reporting date (Stage 1), an entity will typically record a 12month Expected Credit Losses (ECL) (i.e., the expected credit loss that results from default events that are possible within 12
months after the reporting date). It is not the expected cash shortfalls over the 12-month period, but the entire credit loss on an
asset weighted by the probability that the loss will occur in the next 12 months. For trade receivables, contract assets, and lease
receivables, certain simplifications are available that eliminate the need to calculate 12-month ECL and to assess when a
significant increase in credit risk has occurred, as they allow (or in some cases require) measurement of the loss allowance at
initial recognition and throughout the life of an instrument at an amount equal to lifetime ECL.

**US GAAP**

Under US GAAP, the instruments in the scope of the general e current expected credit losses (CECL) model, lifetime
expected credit losses are recorded upon initial recognition of the instrument as an allowance for loan losses.

A-4


-----

**Factoring arrangement**

**IFRS**

IFRS focuses on whether a qualifying transfer has taken place, whether risks and rewards have been transferred, and,
in some cases, whether control over the asset in question has been transferred. Under IFRS 9, full derecognition is appropriate
once both of the following conditions have been met:

     - The financial asset has been transferred outside the consolidated group.

     - The entity has transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset.

If there is a qualifying transfer, an entity must determine the extent to which it retains the risks and rewards of
ownership of the financial asset. IFRS 9 requires the entity to evaluate the extent of the transfer of risks and rewards by
comparing its exposure to the variability in the amounts and timing of the transferred financial assets’ net cash flows, both
before and after the transfer.

If the entity’s exposure does not change substantially, derecognition would be precluded. Rather, a liability equal to
the consideration received would be recorded (i.e., a financing transaction). If, however, substantially all risks and rewards are
transferred, the entity would derecognize the financial asset transferred and recognize separately any asset or liability created
through any rights and obligations retained in the transfer (e.g., servicing assets).

**US GAAP**

US GAAP focuses on whether an entity has surrendered effective control over a transferred asset. The evaluation is
governed by three key considerations:

       - Legal isolation of the transferred asset from the transferor

        - The ability of the transferee (or, if the transferee is a securitization vehicle, each third-party beneficial interest
holder) to pledge or exchange the asset (or the beneficial interest)

       - The transferor has no right or obligation to repurchase the transferred assets

As such, derecognition can be achieved even if the transferor has significant ongoing involvement with the transferred
assets, such as significant exposure to credit risk. If a transfer of an entire financial asset qualifies for sale accounting, the
transferred asset must be derecognized from the transferor’s balance sheet. All assets received and obligations assumed in
exchange are recognized at fair value. If the transferor continues to service the transferred assets, a related servicing asset or
servicing liability should be recorded at its fair value. Any gain or loss on the transfer should be recognized, calculated as the
difference between the net proceeds received and the carrying value of the assets sold.

**Derivatives**

**IFRS**

IFRS defines a derivative as a financial instrument whose value changes in response to a specified variable or
underlying rate (for example, interest rate), that requires no or little net investment and that is settled at a future date. All
derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet as either financial assets or liabilities. They are initially measured at fair value
on the acquisition date. Subsequent measurement of all derivatives is at their fair value, regardless of any hedging relationship
that might exist. Changes in a derivative’s value are recognized in the income statement as they arise, unless they satisfy the
criteria for hedge accounting. According to IFRS, hedge accounting is permitted provided that an entity meets qualifying criteria
in relation to documentation and hedge effectiveness. Hedging refers to the process of entering into a derivative transaction in
the expectation that the transaction will eliminate or reduce an entity’s exposure to a particular risk.

**US GAAP**

U.S. GAAP defines a derivative as a financial instrument or other contract in the scope of the financial instruments
that has all of the following features:

       - one or more underlyings; and one or more notional amounts or payment provisions or both;

A-5


-----

       - it has an initial net investment smaller than would be required for other instruments that would be expected
to have a similar response to the variable; and

       - it requires or permits net settlement, is readily settleable through a market mechanism outside the contract;
or provides for delivery of an asset that is readily convertible to cash.

The new FASB hedge accounting guidance is intended to simplify certain accounting requirements for hedging
activities, resolve practice issues, and better align hedge accounting with an organization’s risk management activities.
Although both IFRS 9 and the amended ASC 815 guidance permit more hedging strategies to qualify for hedge accounting, the
frameworks retain complex (though different) requirements for hedge accounting. Both the criteria to qualify for hedge
accounting and the accounting for qualifying hedges are different.

**Business combinations**

**IFRS**

IFRS 3 Business Combinations (the “IFRS 3”) outlines the accounting when an acquirer obtains control of a business
(e.g. an acquisition or merger). Such business combinations are accounted for using the ‘acquisition method’, which generally
requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their fair values at the acquisition date. A business
combination is a transaction or event in which an acquirer obtains control of one or more businesses. A business is defined as
an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return
directly to investors or other owners, members or participants (IFRS 3 Appendix A).

**US GAAP**

Similar to IFRS, business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method, with limited exceptions. A
business combination is a transaction or other event in which an acquirer obtains control of one or more businesses. However,
the U.S. GAAP guidance on control differs from IFRS and other differences relate to recognition of certain assets and liabilities
based on the reliably measurable criterion, accounting for contingencies, and accounting for noncontrolling interests.

**Inventory**

**IFRS**

Under IFRS, Last in, first out (LIFO) is prohibited and there is a requirement to use the same cost formula for all
inventories similar in nature or use to the entity; previously recognised impairment losses are reversed up to the amount of the
original impairment loss when the reasons for impairment no longer exist.

**US GAAP**

Under US GAAP, LIFO is an acceptable inventory costing method with no explicit requirement for a consistent cost
formula for all inventories similar in nature. Any write-down of inventory below cost creates a new cost basis that cannot be
subsequently reversed.

**Deferred Taxes Recognition of deferred tax asset**

**IFRS**

Under IFRS, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent it is probable (i.e. more likely than not) that they
will be realised. Deferred taxation is provided based on the enacted or “substantively enacted” tax rates as of balance sheet
date.

IFRS requires all amounts to be classified as noncurrent in the balance sheet.

**US GAAP**

Deferred taxation is provided on all temporary differences between the tax and book bases of assets and liabilities at
the enacted statutory tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is

A-6


-----

expected to be settled or realised at the reporting date, subject to a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the
amount which “more likely than not” will be realised in the future.

US GAAP requires that all amounts be classified as noncurrent in the balance sheet.

**Leases**

**IFRS**

IFRS 16—Leases is the applicable reporting standard for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2019.

Under IFRS, lessees will record all leases within the scope of the standard, regardless of classification, on the balance
sheet as a right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement. The initial right-of-use asset and lease liability will
be measured based on the present value of the lease payments using the interest rate implicit in the lease (unless the rate cannot
be readily determined, in which case the incremental borrowing rate of the lessee will be used). The incremental borrowing
rate requires use of a borrowing rate for a similar security with a similar value to the right-of-use asset. IFRS no longer
differentiates between finance and operating leases.

Under IFRS, The income statement recognition for lessees will consist of an amortization of the right-of-use asset and
interest expense related to the lease liability.

Under IFRS, lessees can elect not to recognise leases when the value of the underlying asset is low.

**US GAAP**

Similarly to IFRS, lessees will record all leases within the scope of the standard, regardless of classification, on the
balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement. US GAAP is more general in defining
incremental borrowing rate in that it simply requires use of a collateralized rate for an amount equal to the lease payments.
Under ASC 842, a lessee can have either a finance or operating lease, determined using classification criteria similar to that
used for capital leases in ASC 840. Under US GAAP, the income statement recognition for finance leases will consist of an
amortization of the right-of-use asset and interest expense related to the lease liability, but for leases classified as operating
leases the amortization of the right-of- use asset and interest expense related to the lease liability will be recorded together as
lease (rent) expense to produce a straight-line recognition effect in the income statement.

US GAAP does not have recognition exemption for leases based on value of the underlying assets.

**Employee benefits - Actuarial gains/losses**

**IFRS**

Under IFRS, remeasurement effects are recognized immediately in other comprehensive income and are not
subsequently recorded within profit or loss.

**US GAAP**

US GAAP permits companies to either (1) record gains/losses in the period incurred within the statement of operations
or (2) defer gains/losses through the use of the corridor approach (or any systematic method that results in faster recognition
than the corridor approach). Whether gains/losses are recognized immediately or amortized in a systematic fashion, they are
ultimately recorded within the statement of operations as components of net periodic benefit cost.

**Restructuring Provision**

**IFRS**

IFRS requires that a single approach be used to account for all types of termination benefits. Termination benefits are
recognized at the earlier of (1) when an entity can no longer withdraw an offer of termination benefits, or (2) when it would
recognize restructuring costs in accordance with IAS 37 (i.e., upon communication to those affected employees laid out in a
detailed formal restructuring plan).

A-7


-----

**US GAAP**

Under US GAAP, if there is a pre-existing arrangement such that the employer and employees have a mutual
understanding of the benefits the employee will receive if involuntarily terminated, the cost of the benefits are accrued when
payment is probable and reasonably estimable. In this instance, no announcement to the workforce (nor initiation of the plan)
is required prior to expense recognition.

**Bank overdraft**

**IFRS**

Under IFRS, cash and cash equivalents may also include bank overdrafts repayable on demand that form an integral
part of an entity’s cash management. Short-term bank borrowings are not included in cash or cash equivalents and are
considered to be financing cash flows.

**US GAAP**

Bank overdrafts are not included in cash and cash equivalents; changes in the balances of bank overdrafts are classified
as financing cash flows under US GAAP.

**NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
(in millions, except employee and statistical data)
(Unaudited)

A. Statement of Information Furnished

The Combined Financial Statements present, on a historical cost basis, the combined assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses related to the European Tinplate businesses (the “Company”) of Crown Holdings, Inc. (the “Crown
Holdings” or “Crown”). The Company does not operate as a separate stand-alone entity and is comprised of certain
Crown wholly owned legal entities for which the Company is the sole business, components of legal entities in which
the Company operates in conjunction with other Crown businesses and majority owned joint ventures.

In the opinion of management, these combined financial statements contain all adjustments of a normal and recurring
nature necessary for a fair statement of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2021 and the results of
operations for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 and the cash flows for the three months ended March
31, 2021 and 2020. The results reported in these combined financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the
results that may be expected for the entire year. These results have been determined based on the basis of accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), the application of which requires
management’s utilization of estimates, and actual results may differ materially from the estimates utilized.

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements presented in accordance with
GAAP have been condensed or omitted. The accompanying combined financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the combined financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2020.

The Company is a worldwide leader in the design, manufacture and sale of packaging products for consumer goods.
The Company’s packaging for consumer goods include steel and aluminum cans for food, household and other
consumer products and metal vacuum closures and steel crowns sold through the Company’s sales organization to the
food, citrus, household products, personal care and various other industries.

The Company operates 37 food and closures plants in 16 countries throughout Europe and Africa, including France,
Italy and Spain, three aerosol plants in Italy and the U.K. and four promotional and specialty packaging plants in
France, the Netherlands and the U.K.

The food can business is seasonal with the first quarter tending to be the slowest period as the autumn packaging
period in the Northern Hemisphere has ended and new crops are not yet planted. The industry enters its busiest period
in the third quarter when the majority of fruits and vegetables in the Northern Hemisphere are harvested. Due to this
seasonality, inventory levels increase in the first half of the year to meet peak demand in the second and third quarters.

B. Relationship with Crown and Related Entities

The Company has been managed and operated in the normal course of business with other affiliates of Crown.
Accordingly, certain shared costs have been allocated to the Company and reflected as expenses in the Combined
Financial Statements. Management of Crown and the Company consider the allocation methodologies used to be
reasonable and appropriate reflections of the historical Crown expenses attributable to the Company for purposes
of the stand-alone financial statements. The expenses reflected in the Combined Financial Statements may not be
indicative of expenses that will be incurred by the Company in the future or that may be incurred by the Company
on a stand-alone basis. All related party transactions approximate market prices.

Related Party Purchases and Sales

Throughout the periods covered by the Combined Financial Statements, the Company sold goods to and purchased
goods from other Crown businesses. Net sales and Cost of product sold, excluding depreciation and amortization,
included the following amounts related to the sale and purchase of finished goods to other Crown businesses:

Corporate Expense Allocations

Crown incurs significant corporate costs for services provided to the Company as well as other Crown businesses.
These costs include expenses for executive management, finance, legal, information technology, employee benefit
administration, treasury and risk management. A portion of these costs benefit multiple or all of Crown’s businesses,
including the Company, and are allocated to the Company using an allocation method primarily based on percentage
of sales.

Corporate expenses of $14 were recorded in the Combined Financial Statements in selling and administrative expense
for both the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.

Amortization expense was $5 and $4 for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.

F. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

In March 2015, the Bundeskartellamt, or German Federal Cartel Office (“FCO”), conducted unannounced inspections
of the premises of several metal packaging manufacturers, including a German subsidiary of the Company. The local
court order authorizing the inspection cited FCO suspicions of anti-competitive agreements in the German market for
the supply of metal packaging products. The Company conducted an internal investigation into the matter and
discovered instances of inappropriate conduct by certain employees of German subsidiaries of the Company. The
Company cooperated with the FCO and submitted a leniency application with the FCO which disclosed the findings
of its internal investigation to date. In April 2018, the FCO discontinued its national investigation and referred the
matter to the European Commission (the “Commission”). Following the referral, Commission officials conducted
unannounced inspections of the premises of several metal packaging manufacturers, including Company subsidiaries
in Germany, France and the United Kingdom.

The Commission’s investigation is ongoing and, to date, the Commission has not officially charged the Company or
any of its subsidiaries with violations of competition law. The Company is cooperating with the Commission and
submitted a leniency application with the Commission with respect to the findings of the investigation in Germany
referenced above. This application may lead to the reduction of possible future penalties. At this stage of the
investigation the Company believes that a loss is probable but is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the
Commission’s investigation and is unable to estimate the loss or possible range of losses that could be incurred, and
has therefore not recorded a charge in connection with the actions by the Commission. If the Commission finds that
the Company or any of its subsidiaries violated competition law, fines levied by the Commission could be material to
the Company’s operating results and cash flows for the periods in which they are resolved or become reasonably
estimable.

The Company is also subject to various other lawsuits and claims with respect to labor, environmental, securities,
vendor and other matters arising out of the Company’s normal course of business. While the impact on future financial
results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists, management believes that the
ultimate liabilities resulting from such lawsuits and claims will not materially affect the Company’s earnings, financial
position or cash flow. The Company has various commitments to purchase materials, supplies and utilities as part of
the ordinary conduct of business.

The Company’s basic raw materials for its products are steel and aluminum, both of which are purchased from multiple
sources. The Company is subject to fluctuations in the cost of these raw materials and has periodically adjusted its
selling prices to reflect these movements. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be able to fully
recover any increases or fluctuations in raw material costs from its customers. The Company also has commitments
for standby letters of credit and for purchases of capital assets.

H. Revenue

The Company recognized revenue as follows:

**Three Months Ended**

**2021** **2020**
Revenue recognized over time ..................................................... $ 238 $ 211
Revenue recognized at a point in time............................................ 292 249

Total revenue .......................................................................... [$] 530 $ 460

The Company has applied the practical expedient to exclude disclosure of remaining performance obligations as its
binding orders typically have a term of one year or less.

Contract Assets

Contract assets are typically recognized for work in process related to the Company’s three-piece printed products.
Contract assets were as follows:

**March 31,** **December 31,**

**2021** **2020**

Contract assets included in prepaid and other current assets ................. $ 16 $ 17

During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company satisfied performance obligations related to contract
assets recorded by the Company’s European food business at December 31, 2020 and also recorded new contract
assets related to work in process for the Company’s European food business.

I. Subsequent Events


On April 8, 2021, Crown announced that it entered into a Share and Asset Purchase Agreement which provides for the
sale (the “Transaction”) of the Company to KOUTI B.V., an affiliate of KPS Capital Partners LP. The completion of
the Transaction is subject to the fulfillment of various conditions, including, among others, receipt of approvals from
antitrust regulators in certain jurisdictions. Completion of the Transaction is expected during the third quarter of 2021.

F-11


-----

However, given the number of jurisdictions in which antitrust approval is required, there is no assurance that the
Transaction can be completed on that timeframe.

The Combined Financial Statements of the Company are derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements of
Crown, which issued its statements for the three months ended March 31, 2021 on April 23, 2021. Accordingly, the
Company has evaluated transactions or other events for which consideration as recognized subsequent events in the
Combined Financial Statements through May 17, 2021. Additionally, the Company has evaluated transactions and
other events that occurred through the issuance of these Combined Financial Statements on May 17, 2021, for purposes
of disclosure of unrecognized subsequent events.

**Report of Independent Auditors**

To the Management of European Tinplate businesses of Crown Holdings, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying combined financial statements of the European Tinplate business of Crown
Holdings, Inc., which comprise the combined balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 and
the related combined statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020.

_Management’s Responsibility for the Combined Financial Statements_

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the combined financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design,
implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of combined
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

_Auditors’ Responsibility_

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the combined financial statements based on our audits. We conducted
our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the combined financial
statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the combined
financial statements. The procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of
material misstatement of the combined financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk
assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the Company’s preparation and fair presentation of the combined
financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no
such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness
of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
combined financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our audit opinion.

_Opinion_

In our opinion, the combined financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the European Tinplate business of Crown Holdings Inc., as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019,
and the related combined statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

**_Changes in Accounting Principles_**

As discussed in Note B to the combined financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
for leases in 2019 and the manner in which it accounts for revenues from contracts with customers in 2018.

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in millions, except employee and statistical data)

A. Description of Business

The Combined Financial Statements present, on a historical cost basis, the combined assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses related to the European Tinplate businesses (the “Company”) of Crown Holdings, Inc. (the “Crown
Holdings” or “Crown”). The Company does not operate as a separate stand-alone entity and is comprised of certain
Crown wholly owned legal entities for which the Company is the sole business, components of legal entities in which
the Company operates in conjunction with other Crown businesses and majority owned joint ventures.

The Company is a worldwide leader in the design, manufacture and sale of packaging products for consumer goods.
The Company’s packaging for consumer goods include steel and aluminum cans for food, household and other
consumer products and metal vacuum closures and steel crowns sold through the Company’s sales organization to the
food, citrus, household products, personal care and various other industries.

The Company operates 37 food and closures plants in 16 countries throughout Europe and Africa, including France,
Italy and Spain, three aerosol plants in Italy and the U.K. and four promotional and specialty packaging plants in
France, the Netherlands and the U.K.

The food can business is seasonal with the first quarter tending to be the slowest period as the autumn packaging
period in the Northern Hemisphere has ended and new crops are not yet planted. The industry enters its busiest period
in the third quarter when the majority of fruits and vegetables in the Northern Hemisphere are harvested. Due to this
seasonality, inventory levels increase in the first half of the year to meet peak demand in the second and third quarters.

B. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

**Business and Principles of Combination.** The financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America and reflect management’s estimates and assumptions.
Actual results could differ from those estimates, impacting reported results of operations and financial position. All
intercompany accounts and transactions within the Company have been eliminated in the preparation of the combined
financial statements. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions with Crown are considered related party
transactions and deemed to have been paid in the period the cost was incurred.

Throughout the periods covered by the Combined Financial Statements, the Company, operated as a part of Crown.
Consequently, stand-alone financial statements have not been historically prepared for the Company. The
accompanying Combined Financial Statements have been derived from Crown’s historical accounting records and as
if the Company operated on a stand-alone basis. The Combined Financial Statements include the historical operations,
assets and liabilities of the legal entities and components of legal entities that are considered to comprise the
Company’s business.

The Combined Statements of Operations include all revenues and costs directly attributable to the Company, including
costs for facilities, functions and services used by the Company. Costs for certain administrative functions and services
performed by centralized Crown organizations are charged to the Company using an allocation method primarily
based on percentage of sales. The Combined Statements of Operations also includes allocations of Crown’s general
corporate expenses, including but not limited to, executive management, finance, legal, information technology,
employee benefit administration, treasury and risk management. Current and deferred income taxes and related tax
expense have been determined based on the stand-alone results of the Company in each country as if it were a separate
taxpayer.

Charges and allocations for costs for facilities, functions and services performed by Crown have been deemed paid by
the Company to Crown in the period in which the cost was recorded in the Combined Statement of Operations. The
Company’s portion of current income taxes payable is deemed to have been remitted to Crown in the period the related
tax expense was recorded. The Company’s portion of current income tax receivable is deemed to have been remitted

F-21


-----

**(A Business of Crown Holdings, Inc.)**

to the Company by Crown in the period in which the receivable applies only to the extent that a refund of such taxes
could have been recognized by the Company on a stand-alone basis under the law of the relevant taxing jurisdiction.

Crown uses a centralized approach to cash management and financing most of its operations. Accordingly, the cash
and cash equivalents included on the Combined Balance Sheets represents cash balances specifically attributable to
the Company at the end of each reporting period. Transfers of cash, both to and from Crown’s centralized cash
management system, are reflected as a component of Crown net investment on the Combined Balance Sheet and as a
financing activity on the Combined Statement of Cash Flow. All related party long-term debt receivable and payable
balances, including those supported by written agreements, between the Company and other Crown subsidiaries are
included in Crown net investment, as the Company anticipates these balances will be settled. Crown’s short and longterm debt, and the related interest expense, has not been allocated to the Company’s Combined Financial Statements
because it is not specifically identifiable to the Company. Transactions between Crown and the Company are
accounted for through Crown net investment and are deemed to have been settled immediately.

The allocations and estimates in the Combined Financial Statements are based on assumptions that management of
Crown and the Company believes are reasonable. However, the Combined Financial Statements included herein may
not be indicative of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company in the future or if the
Company had been a separate, stand-alone entity during the periods presented.

**Crown Equity. Crown Equity in the Combined Balance Sheets represent Crown’s historical net investment in the**
Company, the net effect of cost allocations from and transactions with Crown, net cash transfers to Crown and the
Company’s accumulated earnings.

**Foreign Currency Translation. For non-U.S. businesses which operate in a local currency environment, assets and**
liabilities are translated into US Dollars at year-end exchange rates. Income, expense and cash flow items are translated
at average exchange rates prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments for these businesses are included within
Crown net investment.

**Revenue Recognition. On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted new accounting guidance which outlined a single**
comprehensive model to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and superseded previous
revenue recognition guidance. The Company adopted the new revenue guidance using the modified retrospective
method applied to those contracts which were outstanding as of January 1, 2018. The Company recognized the
cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of Crown net investment.
Under the new guidance, revenues are recognized when control of the promised product is transferred to customers.

The majority of the Company’s revenues are derived from multi-year requirement contracts with leading
manufacturers and marketers of packaged consumer products for can sets, comprising a can and an end. As
requirement contracts do not typically include fixed volumes, customers often purchase products pursuant to purchase
orders or other communications which are short-term in nature. The can and the end are considered separate
performance obligations because they are distinct and separately identifiable.

The Company manufactures certain products that have no alternative use to the Company once they are printed or
manufactured to customer specifications. If the Company has an enforceable right to payment for custom products at
all times in the manufacturing process, revenue is recognized over time. The timing of revenue recognition for the
Company’s products may vary as these products may be printed or customized depending upon customer preferences
which can vary by geographic market. Revenue that is recognized over time is generally recognized using the cost-tocost input method as these products involve an intermediary step that results in customized work-in-process inventory.
For products that follow a point in time model, revenue is generally recognized when title and risk of loss transfer.

Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring
goods or providing services. Standalone selling prices for each performance obligation are generally stated in the
contract. When the Company offers variable consideration in the form of volume rebates to customers, it estimates the
most likely amount of revenue to which it is expected to be entitled and includes the estimate in the transaction price,
limited to the amount which is probable will not result in reversal of cumulative revenue recognized when the variable
consideration is resolved. When the Company offers customers options to purchase additional product at discounted
prices, judgment is required to determine if the discounted prices represent material rights. If so, the transaction price

allocated to the discount is based on its relative standalone price and is recognized upon purchase of the additional
product. Customer payment terms are typically less than one year and as such, the Company has applied the practical
expedient to exclude consideration of significant financing components from the determination of transaction price.

Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from net sales. Shipping and
handling fees and costs from product sales are reported as cost of products sold and are accrued when the Company
recognizes revenue over time before the shipping and handling activities occur. Costs to obtain a contract are generally
immaterial but the Company has elected the practical expedient to expense these costs as incurred if the duration of
the contract is one year or less.

Unbilled receivables are recorded for revenue recognized over time when the Company has determined that control
has passed to the customer but the customer has not yet been invoiced because the Company does not have present
right to payment. The Company generally has a present right to payment when title of product transfers. Unbilled
receivables are included in receivables in the Combined Balance Sheet with a corresponding decrease to inventory.

Contract assets are recorded for revenue recognized over time when the Company has determined that control for a
performance obligation has passed to the customer, but the right to invoice the customer is contingent upon the
completion of the performance obligations included in the contract. Contract assets are classified as current as they
are expected to be invoiced within one year and may not exceed their net realizable value.

Contract liabilities are established if the Company must defer the recognition of a portion of consideration received
because it has to satisfy a future obligation. Contract liabilities are classified as current or noncurrent based on when
the Company expects to recognize revenue.

**Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash equivalents represent investments with maturities of three months or less from the**
time of purchase and are carried at cost, which approximates fair value because of the short maturity of those
instruments. Outstanding checks in excess of funds on deposit are included in accounts payable.

**Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced**
amount and do not bear interest. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on past events, historical
experience, current conditions and forecasts that affect the collectability of accounts receivable.

**Inventory Valuation.** Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost principally
determined under the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) or average cost method.

**Property, Plant and Equipment.** Property, plant and equipment (“PP&E”) is carried at cost less accumulated
depreciation and includes expenditures for new facilities and equipment and those costs which substantially increase
the useful lives or capacity of existing PP&E. Cost of constructed assets includes capitalized interest incurred during
the construction and development period. Maintenance and repairs, including labor and material costs for planned
major maintenance such as annual production line overhauls, are expensed as incurred. When PP&E is retired or
otherwise disposed, the net carrying amount is eliminated with any gain or loss on disposition recognized in earnings
at that time.

Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets described below (in years).
The Company periodically reviews the estimated useful lives of its PP&E and, where appropriate, changes are made
prospectively.

Land improvements ...................................................................................... 25
Buildings and building improvements ................................................................ 25 – 40
Machinery and equipment............................................................................... 3 – 18

**Goodwill.** Assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at
their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the
underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is carried at cost and reviewed for impairment
annually in the fourth quarter of each year or when facts and circumstances indicate goodwill may be impaired.

F-23

**(A Business of Crown Holdings, Inc.)**

Goodwill was allocated to the reporting units at the time of each acquisition based on the relative fair values of the
reporting units. In assessing goodwill for impairment, the Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine
whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair
value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Further quantitative assessment may then be required. The
quantitative assessment involves a number of assumptions and judgments, including the calculation of fair value for
the Company’s identified reporting units. The Company determines the estimated fair value of each reporting unit
based on an average of the estimated fair values using an income and a market approach. The income approach utilizes
significant assumptions, including revenue and Adjusted EBITDA margin growth rates and discount rate. If the
carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, any impairment loss is measured by comparing the carrying
value of the reporting unit to its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.

**Intangible Assets. Definite-lived intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Definite-lived**
intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives described below (in years). Definitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
recoverable from their undiscounted cash flows. If impaired, the assets are written down to fair value based on either
discounted cash flows or appraised values.

Customer relationships .................................................................................. 13
Patents ...................................................................................................... 3

**Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying**
value of long-lived assets, primarily PP&E, may be impaired, the Company performs a recoverability evaluation. If
the evaluation indicates that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows, an
impairment loss is measured by comparing the carrying value of the asset to its fair value, based on discounted cash
flows. Long-lived assets classified as held for sale are presented in the balance sheet at the lower of their carrying
value or fair value less cost to sell.

Leases. On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted new guidance on lease accounting. Under the guidance, lease
classification criteria and income statement recognition were similar to previous guidance; however, all leases with a
term longer than one year are recorded on the balance sheet through a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability.

The Company has operating leases for land and buildings related to certain manufacturing facilities, warehouses and
corporate offices, vehicle fleets and certain office and manufacturing equipment. Leases with an initial term of 12
months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. The Company’s lease terms include options to extend the lease
when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. Variable lease payment amounts that cannot
be determined at commencement of the lease, such as increases in index rates, are not included in the measurement of
the lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets and are recognized in the period those payments are incurred.
The Company separates lease and non-lease components of lease arrangements and allocates contract consideration
based on standalone selling prices. Variable consideration is allocated to the lease and non-lease components to which
the variable payments specifically relates. The discount rate implicit within the Company’s leases is often not
determinable and therefore the Company generally uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information
available at the commencement date of the lease in determining the present value of the lease payments. The
incremental borrowing rate is determined based on lease term and the currency in which lease payments are made.
The Company’s leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

**Taxes on Income. The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach. Deferred taxes**
represent the future expected tax consequences of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets
and liabilities based upon enacted tax rates and laws.

Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will
not be realized. Investment tax credits are accounted for using the deferral method. Income tax-related interest and
penalties are reported as income tax expense.

**Derivatives and Hedging. In the normal course of business the Company is subject to risk from adverse fluctuations**
in currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The Company manages these risks through a program that includes

F-24


-----

**(A Business of Crown Holdings, Inc.)**

the use of derivative financial instruments, primarily swaps and forwards. Counterparties to these contracts are major
financial institutions. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties.
The company does not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

All outstanding derivative financial instruments are recognized in the balance sheet at their fair values. The Company
applies a market approach to value its commodity price hedge contracts. Prices from observable markets are used to
develop the fair value of these instruments. The Company uses an income approach to value its foreign exchange
contracts. These contracts are valued using a discounted cash flow model that calculates the net present value of future
cash flows under the terms of the contracts using market information as of the reporting date, such as foreign exchange
spot and forward rates.

The impact on earnings from recognizing the fair values of these instruments depends on their intended use, their
hedge designation and their effectiveness in offsetting changes in the fair values of the exposures they are hedging.
Changes in the fair values of instruments designated to reduce or eliminate adverse fluctuations in the fair values of
recognized assets and liabilities are reported currently in earnings along with changes in the fair values of the hedged
items. Changes in the effective portions of the fair values of instruments used to reduce or eliminate adverse
fluctuations in cash flows of anticipated or forecasted transactions are reported in equity as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified to
earnings when the related hedged items impact earnings or the anticipated transactions are no longer probable.
Changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges or do not qualify for hedge
accounting treatment are reported currently in earnings. Amounts reported in earnings are classified consistent with
the item being hedged.

The effectiveness of derivative instruments in reducing risks associated with the hedged exposures is assessed at
inception and on an ongoing basis. Time value, a component of an instrument’s fair value, is excluded in assessing
effectiveness for fair value hedges, except hedges of firm commitments, and included for cash flow hedges.

Hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when (i) the instrument is no longer effective in offsetting changes in
fair value or cash flows of the underlying hedged item, (ii) the instrument expires, is sold, terminated or exercised, or
(iii) designating the instrument as a hedge is no longer appropriate.

The Company formally documents all relationships between its hedging instruments and hedged items at inception,
including its risk management objective and strategy for establishing various hedge relationships. Cash flows from
hedging instruments are classified in the Combined Statements of Cash Flows consistent with the items being hedged.

The Company recorded a gain of less than $1 in Net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 and losses of less
than $1 in Net income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

**Reclassifications. Certain reclassifications of prior years’ data have been made to conform to the current year**
presentation.

Recent Accounting and Reporting Pronouncements.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted new guidance on the accounting for credit losses on financial instruments.
The new guidance introduced an approach, based on expected losses, to estimate credit losses on certain types of
financial instruments. The new approach to estimating credit losses applies to most financial assets measured at
amortized cost and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt
securities, net investments in operating leases and off-balance-sheet credit exposures. The guidance did not have a
material impact on the Company’s Combined Financial statements.

C. Relationship with Crown and Related Entities

The Company has been managed and operated in the normal course of business with other affiliates of Crown.
Accordingly, certain shared costs have been allocated to the Company and reflected as expenses in the Combined
Financial Statements. Management of Crown and the Company consider the allocation methodologies used to be
reasonable and appropriate reflections of the historical Crown expenses attributable to the Company for purposes of
the stand-alone financial statements. The expenses reflected in the Combined Financial Statements may not be
indicative of expenses that will be incurred by the Company in the future or that may be incurred by the Company on
a stand-alone basis. All related party transactions approximate market prices.

Related Party Purchases and Sales

Throughout the periods covered by the Combined Financial Statements, the Company sold goods to and purchased
goods from other Crown businesses. Net sales and Cost of product sold, excluding depreciation and amortization,
included the following amounts related to the sale and purchase of finished goods to other Crown businesses:

**2020** **2019** **2018**

Related party sales ........................................... $ 44 $ 31 $ 29
Related party purchases..................................... 92 82 80

Receivable, net and accounts payable included the following related party receivable and payable balances with
other Crown businesses as of December 31:

**2020** **2019**
Related party receivables ............................................................. $ 5 $ 4
Related party payables ................................................................ 14 15

Corporate Expense Allocations

Crown incurs significant corporate costs for services provided to the Company as well as other Crown businesses.
These costs include expenses for executive management, finance, legal, information technology, employee benefit
administration, treasury and risk management. A portion of these costs benefit multiple or all of Crown’s businesses,
including the Company, and are allocated to the Company using an allocation method primarily based on percentage
of sales.

Corporate expenses of $62, $58 and $56 were recorded in the Combined Financial Statements in selling and
administrative expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.

Management and Financing

The Company participates in Crown centralized cash management and finance programs. Crown maintains an
international cash pooling arrangement which allows operations with excess cash to invest and operations with
cash needs to utilize the excess cash. All short and long-term debt is financed by Crown and financing decisions
for wholly and majority owned subsidiaries is determined by central Crown treasury operations.

The Company participates in certain of Crown’s receivables securitization facilities. The Company accounts for
transfers under its securitization facilities as sales because the Company sells full title and ownership in the underlying
receivables and has met the criteria for control of the receivables to be considered transferred.

The Company accounts for its factoring arrangements as either sales or secured borrowing based on whether it has
transferred control over the factored receivables. The Company’s continuing involvement in factored receivables
accounted for as sales is limited to servicing the receivables. The Company receives adequate compensation for
servicing the receivables and no servicing asset or liability is recorded.

At December 31, amounts securitized or factored were as follows:

**2020** **2019**
Accounted for as sales ................................................................................ $ 436 $ 421
Accounted for as secured borrowings........................................................ 17 14

The Company recorded expenses related to factoring facilities of $8 in both 2020 and 2019 and $10 in 2018.

F. Goodwill

Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reporting unit for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were
as follows:


**European**
**Aerosols and**
**Promotional**

**European Food** **Packaging** **Total**

Foreign currency translation.................................................. 107 4 111

$ 1,377 71 1,448
**Balance at December 31, 2020............................................**

In recent years market demand for three-piece aerosol packaging has gradually declined. This decline combined with
higher operating costs that had not been fully recovered in selling prices had an adverse impact on the expected future
cash flows utilized in the Company’s valuation of its European Aerosols and Promotional Packaging reporting unit.
As a result, the reporting unit’s fair value declined below its carrying value and the Company recorded an impairment
charge in 2019.

retrospective basis. Total operating lease expense under the previous guidance was $15 for the year ended December
31, 2018.

The Company recorded $12 of operating lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The

In 2019, asset impairments and sales included gains on the sale of various assets across the Company’s operations. In
2018, asset impairments and sales included gains on sales of two food can facilities in the U.K.

Restructuring costs in each year related to headcount reductions across the Company’s businesses.

At December 31, 2020, the Company had a restructuring accrual of $8, primarily related to actions to reduce
manufacturing capacity and headcount across businesses. The Company expects to pay these amounts over the next
twelve months.

M. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

In March 2015, the Bundeskartellamt, or German Federal Cartel Office (“FCO”), conducted unannounced inspections
of the premises of several metal packaging manufacturers, including a German subsidiary of the Company. The local
court order authorizing the inspection cited FCO suspicions of anti-competitive agreements in the German market for
the supply of metal packaging products. The Company conducted an internal investigation into the matter and
discovered instances of inappropriate conduct by certain employees of German subsidiaries of the Company. The
Company cooperated with the FCO and submitted a leniency application with the FCO which disclosed the findings
of its internal investigation to date. In April 2018, the FCO discontinued its national investigation and referred the
matter to the European Commission (the “Commission”). Following the referral, Commission officials conducted
unannounced inspections of the premises of several metal packaging manufacturers, including Company subsidiaries
in Germany, France and the United Kingdom.

The Commission’s investigation is ongoing and, to date, the Commission has not officially charged the Company or
any of its subsidiaries with violations of competition law. The Company is cooperating with the Commission and
submitted a leniency application with the Commission with respect to the findings of the investigation in Germany
referenced above. This application may lead to the reduction of possible future penalties. At this stage of the
investigation the Company believes that a loss is probable but is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the
Commission’s investigation and is unable to estimate the loss or possible range of losses that could be incurred, and
has therefore not recorded a charge in connection with the actions by the Commission. If the Commission finds that
the Company or any of its subsidiaries violated competition law, fines levied by the Commission could be material to
the Company’s operating results and cash flows for the periods in which they are resolved or become reasonably
estimable.

The Company is also subject to various other lawsuits and claims with respect to labor, environmental, securities,
vendor and other matters arising out of the Company’s normal course of business. While the impact on future financial
results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists, management believes that the
ultimate liabilities resulting from such lawsuits and claims will not materially affect the Company’s earnings, financial
position or cash flow. The Company has various commitments to purchase materials, supplies and utilities as part of
the ordinary conduct of business.

The Company’s basic raw materials for its products are steel and aluminum, both of which are purchased from multiple
sources. The Company is subject to fluctuations in the cost of these raw materials and has periodically adjusted its
selling prices to reflect these movements. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be able to fully
recover any increases or fluctuations in raw material costs from its customers. The Company also has commitments
for standby letters of credit and for purchases of capital assets.

The Company’s current liability at December 31, 2020, represents the expected required payments to be made for
unfunded plans over the next twelve months. Total estimated 2021 employer contributions are $2 for the Company’s
pension plans.

Changes in the net loss for the Company’s pension plans were:

$ 19 $ 18 $ 12
Balance at December 31 ............................................................................

Actuarial gains and losses arise each year primarily due to changes in discount rates, differences in actual plan asset
returns compared to expected returns, and changes in actuarial assumptions such as mortality.

The estimated portions of the net losses that are expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit
cost / (credit) in 2021 is $2.

Expected future benefit payments as of December 31, 2020 are:

**Benefit Payments**
2021 ......................................................................................................... 2
2022 ......................................................................................................... 2
2023 ......................................................................................................... 2
2024 ......................................................................................................... 2
2025 ......................................................................................................... 2
2026 – 2030................................................................................................ 10

The weighted average actuarial assumptions used to calculate the benefit obligations at December 31 were:

**2020** **2019** **2018**

Discount rate.................................................................. 0.6% 1.0% 1.8%
Compensation increase ..................................................... 2.5% 2.5% 2.5%

The weighted average actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension expense for each year were:

**2020** **2019** **2018**
Discount rate - service cost .................................................................. 1.0% 1.8% 1.6%
Discount rate - interest cost.................................................................. 1.0% 1.8% 1.6%
Compensation increase......................................................................... 2.5% 2.5% 2.5%

In addition, the Company, along with other affiliates of Crown, participates in certain defined benefit plans sponsored
by Crown and sponsorship will not transfer to the Company. The Company recorded expense of less than $1 for the
year ended December 31, 2020 and $2 and $1 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

**Other Postretirement Benefit Plans. In addition, the Company sponsors an unfunded plan to provide health care and**
life insurance benefits to certain employees and their survivors in Morocco. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the
Company recorded a liability of $4 related to this plan.

**Defined Contribution Benefit Plans. The Company also participates in defined contribution benefit plans sponsored**
by Crown in the U.K. and sponsorship will not transfer to the Company. The Company recognized expense of $4 for
the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and $2 for the year ended December 31, 2018 for participation in these
plans.

P. Income Taxes

The Company is comprised of certain Crown wholly owned legal entities for which the Company is the sole business,
components of legal entities in which the Company operates in conjunction with other Crown businesses and majority
owned joint ventures. In jurisdictions where the Company operates in conjunction with other Crown businesses a
consolidated return is filed for the tax grouping of the affiliated entities within the respective jurisdiction. For those
entities the provision for income taxes has been calculated as if the Company filed separate tax return. The Company’s
provision for income taxes as presented may not be indicative of the income taxes that the Company will generate in
the future.

The Company’s effective income tax rates were as follows:
