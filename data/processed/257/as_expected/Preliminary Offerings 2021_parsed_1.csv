The Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements present, on a historical cost basis, the combined assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses related to the Business constituting the Titan Group. Throughout the periods covered by the Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements, the Titan Group, operated as a part of Crown. Consequently, stand-alone financial statements have not been historically prepared for the Titan Group. The Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements have been derived from Crown’s historical accounting records and as if the Titan Group operated on a stand-alone basis. The Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements include the historical operations, assets and liabilities of the legal entities and components of legal entities that are considered to comprise Titan Group’s Business.

Crown uses a centralized approach to cash management and financing most of its operations. Accordingly, the cash and cash equivalents included on the Combined Balance Sheets represents cash balances specifically attributable to the Titan Group at the end of each reporting period. The allocations and estimates in the Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements are based on assumptions that Management believes are reasonable. The assets, liabilities, income and expenses that the directors have determined relate to the Titan Group include all those that are directly attributable and/or separately identifiable to the Titan Group, together with an allocation of the items that are not. Certain estimates, judgments and assumptions have been made for the purpose of allocating items to the Financial Statements that are not directly attributable and/or separately identifiable. ----- The Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements do not necessarily reflect the Titan Group’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows had the Titan Group been a separate entity, or the future results of the Titan Group as it will exist upon the completion of the separation from Crown.

The application of PPA adjustments could result in different carrying values for existing assets and assets we may add to our statement of financial position, which may include intangible assets, such as goodwill, brands, rights of use, contractual rights with franchisees leasehold rights and software, and different amortization and depreciation expenses.

We present these APMs because we believe that the APMs contribute to a better understanding of our results of operations by providing additional information on what we consider some of the drivers of our financial performance. Furthermore, we believe that these APMs are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. In addition, the presentation of these measures is not intended to and does not comply with the reporting requirements of the SEC; compliance with its requirements would require us to make changes to the presentation of this information. However, the Company believes that the description of these APMs in this offering memorandum follows and complies with the European Securities and Markets Authority Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures (APM) dated October 5, 2015. APMs should not be considered in isolation and investors should not consider such information as alternatives to revenue, profit before tax or cash flows from operations calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as indications of operating performance or as measures of the Company’s profitability or liquidity. Such financial information must be considered only in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial information prepared in accordance with US GAAP included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these APMs and are also advised to review them in conjunction with the Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Condensed Combined Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, the Issuer’s computation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin and other APMs may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures or ratios used by other companies. We believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin are meaningful for investors because they provide an analysis of our operating results, profitability and ability to service debt and because they are used by our chief operating decision makers to track our business evolution, establish operational and strategic targets and make important business decisions.

Such data, statistics and other information are based on market research, which itself is based on sampling and subjective judgments by both the researchers and the respondents, including judgments about what types of products and transactions should be included in the relevant market. In addition, the value of comparisons of data and statistics for different markets is limited by many factors, including that (i) the markets are defined differently, (ii) the underlying information was gathered by different methods and (iii) different assumptions were applied in compiling the data and statistics.

We are the clear market leader in the 26.7-billion-unit European market for metal food cans and ends, holding the number one market position with an approximate 39% market share based on volume in the year ended December 31, 2020. As the largest European manufacturer of metal food cans and ends and the largest European buyer of tinplate steel (based on our estimated consumption of approximately 20% of total European tinplate production), our business is a critical asset in the European food supply chain. We have been in the industry for more than 200 years and have an established reputation for the highest quality products and exceptional customer service. From the founding of our predecessor business in 1799 to our acquisition by Crown in 1996 and our acquisition of Mivisa in 2014, our business has shown itself to be a leader in European metal packaging time and time again. Following the Transactions, we will become a leading stand-alone business in Europe. Our product portfolio consists predominantly of food packaging, with approximately 95% of our sales in the year ended December 31, 2020 going to food related end markets. Our products are used by hundreds of millions of consumers on a daily basis across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we produced approximately 12 billion food cans, approximately 24 billion ends, approximately 5.3 billion metal closures, approximately 581 million aerosol cans and approximately 134 million metal promotional packaging containers. Our products are used to package food in a diverse array of end-markets, including fruits and vegetables, tomatoes, fish, pet food, culinary, infant nutrition and dairy. Each of our end-markets is driven by fundamental demand drivers that are stable and largely uncorrelated with broader macroeconomic cycles.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428
257_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,"Note: For the year ended December 31, 2020",9.2.1,"3. Diverse, blue-chip customer base with longstanding, contractual relationships","We supply over 1,000 customers across a range of resilient product categories and end markets. No single customer represented more than 8% of our sales in the year ended December 31, 2020, with our top 10 customers representing 32% of sales for the same period. Our customers include blue-chip, global food and consumer businesses including Abbott, Bonduelle, Danone, Nestle and Unilever, large national and regional food companies, as well as many smaller and independent fisheries and farmers. We benefit from long-standing relationships with our customers, having worked with our top 10 customers on average for over 25 years. We are the sole or main supplier for several of our top customers. We believe that the quality of our products, our track record of providing reliable supply proven over decades and the significant costs to customers involved in switching manufacturers creates customer stickiness. Before a manufacturing plant or line can begin manufacturing new can SKUs for a customer, its products typically must be qualified through a process that can take several months to over a year. In addition, can manufacturers may face downtime on their lines when running new SKUs, thereby impacting customers’ security and reliability of supply. Customers who decide to change manufacturers also typically lose the benefit of volume rebates from former suppliers and face uncertainty regarding the stability, reliability and quality of their new partners. Customers praise our technological know-how, understanding of their requirements and ability to produce and deliver large volumes of specialty food cans consistently on time and in full. Our customers incur high costs if their packaging is not delivered when required. As an example, tomatoes must be sealed in their packaging within six hours of being picked to ensure their freshness, often requiring our manufacturing facilities to ship dozens of truckloads of food cans per day in a continuous rotation to certain customer facilities during harvest season. We are recognized as an industry leader in product development and deliver solutions that offer greater consumer convenience and functionality in response to market demands. Can fillers require producers who can satisfy their branding, quality and safety needs. We believe we consistently satisfy these needs and enable our customers to differentiate their brands through packaging and address changing safety requirements ahead of time.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

Sustainability- and consumer-driven tailwinds benefit metal packaging,"Our metal packaging products are favorably positioned to benefit from the increase in demand for sustainable packaging given their infinitely recyclable nature. Greater environmental consciousness and strong sustainability trends are expected to support an increased preference for metal packaging over the long-term. End consumers increasingly view sustainability as a key purchasing criteria and seek out more environmentally friendly packaging. Food producers – our customers – are aggressively responding to this demand. For example, several major food conglomerates have announced that they aim to sell mostly recyclable or reusable materials by 2025. These trends are further reinforced by regulatory developments. For example, the EU circular economy plan adopted in 2020 has a clear focus on recyclable packaging, which is likely to put pressure on plastic in favor of other packaging materials. Metal packaging provides excellent options for the sustainability initiatives of companies and brands, since metal properties do not degrade during use or recycling. Consumers already recognize metal packaging as a highly recyclable substrate, evidenced by recycling rates of over 80% for steel and 75% for aluminum in Europe, and food brands increasingly want to position themselves as environmentally friendly. As a further sustainability benefit, metal packaging’s superior barrier properties make it ideal for food preservation, which reduces food waste. Metal packaging increases the accessibility of healthy foods in an economical manner and provides contamination protection, thereby reducing the prevalence of food-borne illnesses. Within the metal packaging industry, we are a European leader in sustainability awareness as a Co-Founder of the Metal Packaging Europe Association and an active participant in other major sustainability focused associations, which serve as conduits for sustainability reform at the regulatory and legislative level.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

Attractive financial profile with flexible cost structure and ability to generate consistent free cash flow,"We have a strong track-record of robust free cash flow generation and cash conversion as a result of our flexible cost structure and resilient cash flows. We generated average annual free cash flow of $239 million and an average cash conversion rate of approximately 88% from 2018 to 2020. ----- Our business is significantly insulated from raw material price fluctuation through a combination of formulaic and negotiated pass-through mechanisms, providing us with consistent historical cash flows and supporting our margins. We have demonstrated our ability to pass through fluctuations in the prices of our raw material inputs over the long term. Based on Management estimates, the vast majority of sales are covered by at least annual contracts, with up to 40% of total sales secured on multi-year contracts. Our customer contracts provide sales volume visibility, as many contracts stipulate a guaranteed percentage of total customer orders for the term of the contract. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, over 97% of Titan Group’s pricing for 2021 was already agreed. We estimate that approximately 87% of our cost base is fully- or semi-variable, consisting mostly of material costs, labor costs, freight, energy, which represented 61%, 15%, 5% and 3%, respectively, of our total costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 in addition to other consumables. The semi-variable characteristics of our labor costs come from our ability to reduce our labor costs through the use of seasonal and temporary employees. Our variable cost structure allows us to quickly adapt our production capacity to harvest cycles, which can result in modest volume fluctuations from year to year. Our cash flow stability is bolstered by the non-cyclical end-markets we serve, our ability to pass-through raw material prices changes, our long-term customer relationships with contracted volumes, and customer stickiness. Our modest capital expenditure requirements and well-managed, disciplined approach to working capital further strengthen our free cash flow conversion. We believe our free cash flow profile will enable us to reduce leverage through debt repayment over time.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

Sales to our top 10 customers represented just 32% of our total sales in the year ended December 31, 2020. We benefit from long-standing relationships with our customers, having worked with our top 10 customers for an average of over 25 years. Our business is significantly insulated from raw material price fluctuation through a combination of formulaic and negotiated raw material pass-through mechanisms, providing us with margin stability and consistent historical cash flows. We have demonstrated our ability to pass through fluctuations in the prices of our raw material inputs over the long term. Moreover, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, Titan Group’s pass-through was on track for full recovery of raw material price increases in 2021. Based on Management estimates, the vast majority of sales are covered by at least annual contracts, with up ----- to 40% of total sales secured on multi-year contracts. Our customer contracts provide sales volume visibility, as many contracts stipulate a guaranteed percentage of total customer orders for the term of the contract. We operate 44 strategically located manufacturing facilities (in addition to the Braunstone site, which will be transferred at the end of the transition period) in 17 countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, which enhance our access to customer end-markets and support local demand. Our manufacturing scale is complemented by our services and customer support capabilities including over 20 technical services locations, seven dedicated product design studios, four dedicated laboratory testing facilities and a world-class research and development facility that have put us at the forefront of the European tinplate packaging industry. In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, we had net sales of $2,241 million, $2,138 million and $2,227 million, respectively, and Adjusted EBITDA of $303 million, $247 million and $267 million, respectively. Our net sales and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA were $2,297 million and $317 million, respectively, for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021. These amounts translate, for convenience purposes only, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, to net sales of €1,897 million, €1,910 million and €1,951 million, respectively, and Adjusted EBITDA of €256 million, €221 million and €234 million, respectively, and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, to net sales and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of €1,974 million and €272 million, respectively. Metal cans represent the best barrier material and provide a shelf life of over two years while still retaining the freshness of the food being packaged. In addition, metal food cans provide a host of other benefits to our customers, including i) allowing for fast filling speeds with limited loss, ii) having high strength and allowing for ease of handling and iii) being resistant to corrosion, thereby allowing for high-acid contents (e.g., tomatoes). These qualities make our products highly costeffective solutions for our customers and limit the threat of substitution from other substrates. ----- The stability of our end-markets is evidenced by their historical and forecast growth rates. According to a leading global consulting firm market growth for the packaging of shelf stable vegetables, culinary products, infant nutrition products and shelf stable fish in Europe have each fluctuated by CAGRs of less than +/-1.5% between 2015 and 2020, and are expected to fluctuate by CAGRs of less than +/-1.5% between 2020 and 2024. Furthermore, between 2015 and 2020 the food can volumes sold in Iberia grew by a CAGR of 2% and in our other key markets of France, Italy, the UK and Germany food can volumes fluctuated by a CAGR of less than +/-1.5% over this period.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428
257_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Strengths,9.3.1,1. Longstanding European market leader and critical asset in the European food packaging supply chain,"We are the clear leader in the European market for food cans and ends, holding the number one market position with an approximate 39% market share based on volume in the year ended December 31, 2020. Sales of metal food cans and ends represented 85% of our total revenue in this period. We also believe that we hold the number one or number two market position in Europe across the other product categories we serve, namely metal closures, aerosol cans and promotional containers with market shares of approximately 28%, 12% and 24%, respectively, measured by volume for the year ended December 31, 2020. We have been in the European market for over 200 years and have a reputation with customers for providing the highest quality products and superior service. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we produced approximately 12 billion food cans, approximately 24 billion ends, approximately 5.3 billion metal closures, approximately 581 million aerosol cans and approximately 134 million metal promotional packaging containers. Including intermediate precursor products, our manufacturing assets produce 500 million products per day on average. We have a well-established manufacturing presence with 44 strategically located manufacturing facilities (in addition to the Braunstone site, which will be transferred at the end of the transition period) across 17 countries enhancing access to customers, end markets, local demand and suppliers. We operate 34 food cans & ends manufacturing facilities (in addition to the Braunstone site, which will be transferred at the end of the transition period), five closures manufacturing facilities, three aerosol manufacturing facilities and three promotional packaging manufacturing facilities. We have a well-invested asset base supported by in-house research and development expertise. We believe the investment required to replicate our facility footprint, in addition to the know-how of operating canmaking assets that we developed over our history create high barriers to entry. The European market for food cans and ends is mature and highly consolidated with the top two players, ourselves and our primary competitor, holding a combined market share of over 65% based on volume in the year ended December 31, 2020. The third largest manufacturer has a market share of 3%. Other competitors consist of mostly regional or local manufacturers, who lack the ability to serve larger food customers at scale or are limited in their ability to serve customers across multiple geographies. The European food cans and ends market is relatively insulated from import competition given the high cost of shipping metal packaging long distances and the short lead times customers demand. Due to the significance of transportation costs in the food can industry, our regional production capabilities support expedient and cost-efficient transportation to local customers. Furthermore, there are high barriers to entry due to sizeable capital requirements needed to add capacity, rigorous qualification requirements demanded by customers, and heightened scrutiny with respect to safety requirements as a result of serving sensitive food end-markets. We hold a critical position in the European food packaging supply chain as the largest European manufacturer of metal food cans and ends and the largest European buyer of tinplate steel. Our business is the key link between tinplate steel, a commodity raw material that we purchase and convert to finished packaging for our large and fragmented, primarily European, customer base of food manufacturers. Can producers are the largest consumers of tinplate steel in Europe, with approximately 90% of tinplate steel in Europe being used in packaging, of which 40 to 50% is for food cans and 10 to 15% is for each of beverages, general line, aerosols and closures. Moreover, the market is largely stable with no significant shifts expected. We ----- are Europe’s largest buyer of tinplate, consuming approximately 20% of all tinplate production in Europe in 2020 according to Management estimates. Tinplate steel suppliers rely on us for a stable source of demand, and our position as the largest consumer of tinplate steel makes us a critical partner to all of the major suppliers of tinplate steel in the European market. Our over 1,000 customers rely on us as Europe’s largest supplier of food cans and ends. Because of our scale, we are often the only supplier that can serve high volume customers on a pan-European basis. Our customers depend on our supply to go to market and rely on our packaging to ensure their products reach store shelves. We provide their products with the benefit of a long shelf life that metal food cans offer. Our packaging is an important part of our customers’ brands, and we work closely with our customers to develop designs that ensure their products are attractive to end-consumers at points of sale.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

Our products serve over 90 countries consisting of both sales into mature, developed countries and higher growth, developing countries. No single country represented more than 15% of our sales in the year ended December 31, 2020, with the largest contributors being France, Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy and Germany at 15%, 14%, 12%, 11% and 7% of sales, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2020. Our product portfolio consists 95% of food packaging, which has historically experienced stable demand throughout economic cycles. We serve numerous food-related end-markets, including shelf-stable fruit and vegetables, shelf-stable fish, culinary (such as baked beans), pet food and infant formula, which represented 24%, 18%, 11%, 8% and 8% of sales, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2020. Each of our end-markets is driven by fundamental demand drivers, such as population growth, eating at home trends, urbanization, and a growing global middle class, that are stable and largely uncorrelated with broader macroeconomic cycles, and not subject to significant innovation threats.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

Operating as a stand-alone entity, we will have greater flexibility to pursue opportunities that were not previously considered or prioritized while integrated within the wider Crown business. In addition, we will have the benefit of a steady capital expenditure program ----- that is focused on our business, allowing us to pursue multi-year growth projects which we were unable to pursue under prior ownership. End-markets such as infant nutrition and wet petfood have volume growth opportunities at attractive margins that we believe we can capture by employing our capabilities and expertise developed in other end-markets. Our metal cans are well-positioned to benefit from these growth opportunities in light of their favorable barrier properties and the premium perception and convenience that our products offer. In addition, we are focused on growing our share and penetration in key emerging markets such as Eastern Europe and Africa, where our existing customers are establishing footprints that we can readily support with existing technologies and know-how.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

Procurement Optimization,"Tinplate steel makes up for more than 80% of our raw materials spend and represented 48% of our cost of products sold in the year ended December 31, 2020. We believe our market position enables us to optimize sourcing and pricing for our tinplate steel purchases and provides further opportunities for margin expansion. While the Business under Crown’s ownership mainly focused on ensuring stability of supply and favorable working capital arrangements, as a stand-alone business we will have the opportunity to manage supply arrangements in support of better margins, including through utilizing a greater share of raw materials from low cost countries. We have developed optimization initiatives to realize the most favorable pricing with suppliers for the highest quality tinplate with the shortest supply chain lead times. There is potential for additional cost savings opportunities in the form of reduced spend on logistics, raw material specification complexity reductions, indirect cost savings and contract structure improvements. We believe there is an opportunity to purchase higher volume of fewer SKUs, and also consolidate production of precursor products into fewer facilities, thereby reducing the number of facilities receiving raw material shipments and to improve the structure of certain of our contracts. In addition, we believe there are opportunities to optimize indirect and other materials procurement through targeted sourcing initiatives. In the three months ended March 31, 2021, Titan Group already realized the benefit of improved procurement practices and commercial efforts, leading to expanding margins for this period.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428
257_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Strategy,9.5.3,3. Manufacturing Optimization,"We expect to realize further efficiencies by improving the asset utilization and productivity of our manufacturing footprint. We intend to employ targeted capital expenditures focused on modernizing the equipment used at several of our key facilities with a goal of increasing the capacity of those facilities and allowing more efficient and cost-effective production while reducing the number of facilities in our network. Our Business grew substantially following the acquisition of Mivisa in 2014, however, we did not fully integrate the Mivisa and legacy manufacturing footprints and did not achieve the margin targets or synergies forecast at the time. We believe that there are certain manufacturing function overlaps and duplications as a result of the acquisition and our organic growth. We intend to replicate the “hub and spoke” operating model, used successfully by Mivisa, whereby certain functions that can easily and cost-effectively be transported are completed at lower cost plants to improve and optimize asset utilization. For example, we believe that the manufacturing of ends and certain upstream functions such as metal processing and coating can be consolidated into facilities that specialize in production of those precursor products. Such products would then be transported to existing can finishing or assembly plants that are located close to our customers and have a lean operating footprint. This approach was successfully developed at Mivisa, which operated the largest ends production facility in the world in Murcia, Spain, producing more than 9 billion ends annually and serviced nearly its entire network using this plant and also serviced a significant export business of ends. We intend to replicate this model across the Group’s existing manufacturing footprint.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

Commercial Excellence and Continuous Improvement Initiatives,"In addition to revenue improvement and market share capture, our strategy also has a strong focus on delivering further cost savings and unlocking further margin improvement potential. We plan to develop a continuous improvement culture and invest in training across the entire business. KPS and Management have conducted a comprehensive and granular review of our operating model. We believe that as a stand-alone business, we will be able to realize these cost savings and margin expansions based on KPS’ proven track record in realising improvements in manufacturing businesses. We have identified a number of commercial excellence and continuous improvement priorities, including (i) more focused deployment of capital expenditures, (ii) quality management in the form of manufacturing and operational excellence initiatives; (iii) maintenance and repair optimization, (iv) using a local sales force to improve engagement between our sales and operations teams and (v) a focus on customer service, innovation and responsiveness initiatives. As a stand-alone business focused on the manufacturing of food cans and ends, we will be more readily able to pursue these opportunities rather than having to compete with the other capital priorities of our former owner. ----- Our planned capital projects include investments focused on asset productivity, such as tooling upgrades to multi-die presses and high speed printing and coating lines capable of delivering up to 300% improvements in productivity. Our planned capital projects typically have a payback of approximately two to three years. We also believe there is an opportunity to improve the effectiveness of our commercial function by streamlining our financial reporting structure, providing greater visibility to our local sales teams and enabling them to optimize the margin profile of products they are selling.

Some of these limitations include the following: (i) they do not reflect capital expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (ii) they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; (iii) they do not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on debt; and (iv) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements.

(b) This amount represents the costs and expenses required to operate the Group on a standalone basis. These costs cover substantially the same categories that comprise the amounts under “ Discontinued Corporate Allocations”. Standalone costs are expected to be significantly less than costs incurred under the Discontinued Corporate Allocations. See “ Risk Factors — Risks Relating to the Acquisition — Titan Group’s ability to _operate its business effectively may suffer if it is unable to cost-effectively establish its own administrative and other support functions in order to operate as a standalone company after the expiration of the Transitional Services Agreement with the Crown Group.” Standalone costs are_ based on management estimates and assumptions (including the successful implementation of our standalone strategy) and are forward looking in nature. As such, this information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our estimates. Any failure by us to successfully execute on our standalone strategy could materially impact our results. As such, this information is inherently subject to business, economic and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our estimated standalone costs and expenses. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial impact or results of these actions and initiatives and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. If one or more of our underlying assumptions proves to have been incorrect, this could lead to substantially higher costs than planned and we may not be able to realize fully, or realize in the anticipated time frame, the estimated benefits from our standalone cost-savings. See ""Risk Factors — Risks Relating to the _Acquisition — Titan Group has no operating history as a standalone company and it may not be successful in implementing its strategy as a standalone business.""_ (c) Following the Completion Date, the Business will operate on a stand-alone basis independently of its United States parent. Given that none of the Group’s operations are in the United States, we expect that our reporting currency will shift from the U.S. Dollar to the Euro and we anticipate preparing our financial statements under IFRS. The amounts in this line item represent the estimated impact of operating lease expenses recognized under IFRS 16, which introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees. The amounts in this line item represent the U.S. GAAP operating lease expense from the Audited Combined Financial Statements as a proxy for the IFRS 16 lease liabilities. See Annex A for a discussion of certain differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. A lessee recognizes a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligations to make lease payments. There are optional exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low value items. (d) This adjustment in the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily relates to a $25 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge, incurred related primarily to our aerosols and promotional packaging activities, resulting from the outlook for tinplate aerosol packaging having declined and operating costs in the aerosol and promotional packaging activities having increased, as well as an $8 million restructuring add-back and a $3 million loss on disposal. The adjustment in the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily relates to a $2 million gain on disposal. The Business has undergone a variety of restructuring efforts, primarily related to plant closures in France and Germany in an effort to reduce overall fixed headcount and duplicative positions. Restructuring costs included in this adjustment take account of severance and other general cost associated with implementing the restructuring such as cleaning or stripping plants. (e) Represents the removal of non-operating costs included in pension expense, in particular amortization of prior year unrealized losses related to German pensions. (f) Represents costs associated with discontinued operations in Peru, primarily comprised of VAT expenses and operating losses. The facility in Peru is not part of the Titan Group going forward. (g) This amount normalizes the impact of bad debt expense to $1.1 million per annum based on historical bad debt expense accruals, run-rate and relatively consistent sales year over year over a period of 10 years. (h) Represents (i) expenses in relation to the implementation of a new information technology system in the year ended December 31, 2018 leading to more precise methodologies in monitoring inventory, (ii) recoveries of customer claims from suppliers in relation to defective products, (iii) removal of EBITDA relating to a customer contract which was discontinued in the year ended December 31, 2018, and (iv) normalizing costs in relation to the Business’ UK pension system due to a change from a defined benefit plan to a defined contribution plan in the year ended December 31, 2019. (i) Our Adjusted EBITDA margin amounted to 13.5%, 11.6%, 12.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, and 8.5% and 14.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. (j) This amount represents estimated savings expected to be realized in connection with procurement initiatives for raw materials, in particular tinplate through, inter alia, negotiation of price discounts in place of long payment terms and intensifying cross-functional cooperation to harmonize specifications of raw materials. Pro forma procurement savings are based on management estimates and assumptions (including the successful implementation of certain initiatives) and are forward-looking in nature. As such, this information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our estimates. Any failure by us to successfully execute on our strategy to achieve procurement efficiencies could materially impact our results. See “ Risk Factors – Titan Group has no operating _history as a standalone company and it may not be successful in implementing its strategy as a standalone business.”_ (k) Not meaningful. (2) Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. ----- (3) Capital expenditure includes both maintenance and growth capital expenditure. In the years ended December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2020, growth capital expenditure represented on average approximately 10% of capital expenditures. (4) Free cash flow represents Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures. (5) Cash conversion represents free cash flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA. (6) Volumes represents the number of units sold of food cans only. (7) Pro forma net debt represents our net debt on a pro forma basis for the Transaction, including an aggregate of €375 million under the Notes offered hereby. See “ Capitalization.” Pro forma net debt is presented for illustrative purposes only and is based on a convenience translation of Euro to US Dollar of 1:1.1728. (8) Pro forma net secured debt represents the Term Loan B Facility net of pro forma cash and cash equivalents. See “ Capitalization.” Pro forma net secured debt is presented for illustrative purposes only and is based on a convenience translation of Euro to US Dollar of 1:1.1728. (9) Pro forma cash interest expense represents cash pay interest payable under the Credit Facilities Agreement (including the Term Loan B Facility but not including the Revolving Credit Facility) and the cash pay interest payable in respect of the Notes as if the Transaction had occurred on April 1, 2020. This amount does not include any interest on lease liabilities, or any commitment or utilization fees associated with the Senior Facilities Agreement and assumes an imputed weighted average interest rate for the Term Loan B Facility. Pro forma cash interest expense is presented for illustrative purposes only and is based on a convenience translation of Euro to US Dollar of 1:1.162. The Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Condensed Combined Financial Statements included in this Offering Memorandum are based on U.S. GAAP, which differs in certain respects from IFRS. For a discussion of certain significant differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS, see Annex A. Management has undertaken a preliminary analysis to assess the potential impact on the Group’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows from a change from U.S. GAAP to IFRS. Management has determined that the application of IFRS 16 is expected to impact the Group's treatment of leases, in particular with respect to the income statement. For the estimated impact of the application of IFRS 16 on the Group's Adjusted EBITDA, see “Summary Financial and Other Information.” While Management believes that the application of IFRS 16 will be the main impact to the Group’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows as a result of the change from U.S. GAAP to IFRS, the Group has not prepared and is not presenting a reconciliation of the Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Combined Consolidated Financial Statements to IFRS in this Offering Memorandum, and it is possible that such a change could lead to other differences to the Group’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows from the amounts presented in this Offering Memorandum. See “Risk Factors – The Financial Statements are based _on U.S. GAAP and there may be differences between our financial position and results of operations prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and IFRS. In addition, should Titan Group decide to adopt IFRS as its accounting reporting method, this could potentially result in material changes to certain of its financial information from the information presented in this Offering Memorandum.”_ ----- Following the Completion Date, the Business will no longer be part of the Crown Group and hence will be operated independently from its United States parent. Given that none of the Group’s operations are in the United States, we expect that our reporting currency will shift from the U.S. Dollar to the Euro, representing the functional currency in a majority of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Therefore, we have included below a convenience translation into the Euro, based on the exchange rates derived from Titan Group’s accounting systems or, in the case of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, the average exchange rate for the twelve months period ended March 31, 2021 based on market observable rates, of the summary financial data included above which is presented for illustrative purposes only.

We do not present in this Offering Memorandum any financial information or financial statements of the Issuer. The following tables present summary combined historical financial information and other data as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021 and the last twelve months ended March 31, 2021 for the Titan Group, which have been derived from the Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements. The Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements present, on a historical cost basis, the combined assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses related to the Business constituting the Titan Group. Throughout the periods covered by the Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements, the Titan Group, operated as a part of Crown. Consequently, stand-alone financial statements have not been historically prepared for the Titan Group. The Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements have been derived from Crown’s historical accounting records and as if the Titan Group operated on a stand-alone basis. The Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements include the historical operations, assets and liabilities of the legal entities and components of legal entities that are considered to comprise Titan Group’s Business._ _The Combined Statement of Operations include all revenues and costs directly attributable to Titan Group, including costs for facilities, functions and services used by the Titan Group._ _Crown uses a centralized approach to cash management and financing most of its operations. Accordingly, the cash and cash equivalents included on the Combined Balance Sheets represents cash balances specifically attributable to the Titan Group at the end of each reporting period._ _The allocations and estimates in the Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements are based on assumptions that Management believes are reasonable. The assets, liabilities, income and expenses that Management have determined relate to the Titan Group include all those that are directly attributable and/or separately identifiable to the Titan Group, together with an allocation of items that are not. Certain estimates, judgments and assumptions have been made for the purpose of allocating items to the Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements that are not directly attributable and/or separately identifiable. The Audited Combined Financial Statements and Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements do not necessarily reflect the Titan Group’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows had the Titan Group been a separate entity, or the future results of the Titan Group as it will exist upon the completion of the Acquisition. We also present in the tables below certain summary pro forma data of the Titan Group. Such summary pro forma data is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what our combined income statement and balance sheet would have been if the Transactions had occurred on the dates indicated and is not intended to project our combined results of operations or combined financial position for any future period or date.

Each Guarantee will provide the relevant holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. In addition, the Issuer and Topco will secure the payment of the Notes on the basis and priority set out in the Intercreditor Agreement by granting security under the relevant Security Documents. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, lenders under the Credit Facilities Agreement and counterparties to certain hedging agreements, and any additional indebtedness secured on the same basis, will have priority over any amounts received from the sale of the Shared Collateral, pursuant to an enforcement action taken with respect to such Collateral. There is no guarantee that the value of the Guarantees or the Collateral will be sufficient to satisfy claims under the Notes. The obligations of the Guarantors and the enforcement of each such Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by such Guarantor under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Guarantee is not in the relevant Guarantor's corporate interests, or the burden of such Guarantee exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor, or such Guarantee would be in breach of capital maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws or would cause the directors of such Guarantor to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability and enforcement of each Guarantee/Security Document would be subject to certain generally available defenses. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law _Considerations” for a description of certain of these limitations in several relevant jurisdictions. If one or more of these laws_ and defenses are applicable, the relevant Guarantor may have no liability, or decreased liability, under its Guarantee. Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other laws, a court could subordinate or void the Guarantees or the security interest granted under the Security Documents and, if payment had already been made under a Guarantee or enforcement proceeds applied under a Security Document, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant Guarantor/security provider, if the court found that: - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds under the relevant Security Document was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law; - the relevant Guarantee or security interest under a Security Document was incurred with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor/security provider or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor/security provider was insolvent when it granted the relevant Guarantee or security interest; - the Guarantor/security provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the relevant Guarantee/security interest and the Guarantor/security provider was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Guarantee/security interest; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Guarantee/Security Document; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; or - the relevant Guarantees/Security Documents were held to exceed the corporate objects/corporate purposes of the Guarantor/security provider or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor/security provider. Certain of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Netherlands, England and Wales, France, Germany, Italy and Spain, as applicable. Enforcement of the obligations under a Guarantee against any such Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to the relevant Guarantor. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance, voidable preferences, thin capitalization or similar laws as well as regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally, by limiting the amounts recoverable under the Guarantees, as applicable, and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can ----- be guaranteed or secured by a particular guarantor of the Notes under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Guarantee is not in the relevant Guarantor’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Guarantee exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor, or such Guarantee would be in breach of capital maintenance, financial assistance, liquidity maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of such subsidiary guarantor to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. An increase in the amount of debt that benefits from such Guarantee without a corresponding increase in the amount of the Guarantee will dilute the value of such Guarantee to its beneficiaries, including the holders of the Notes. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the _Guarantees and the Security Interest and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_ Accordingly, enforcement of any such Guarantee against the relevant Guarantor of the Notes would be subject to certain defenses available to guarantors generally or, in some cases, to limitations contained in the terms of the Guarantee designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant guarantors. As a result, a Guarantor’s liability under its Guarantee could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law applicable to it. For further information see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency _Law Considerations.”_ In addition, where applicable, any “virtual tranching” structure aimed at identifying the relevant portion of the Notes’ proceeds which does not constitute “acquisition debt” in respect of the relevant Italian Guarantor and, indirectly, its subsidiaries and, therefore, does not fall within the prohibition under Italian financial assistance rules (namely, Article 2358 or 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code), is untested in Italian courts and it cannot be excluded that it might be deemed not sufficient to clearly distinguish and separate the non-acquisition portion of the Notes’ proceeds from any portion of the Notes’ proceeds to be utilized to support the acquisition or subscription by the Issuer of the share capital of any Italian Guarantor incorporated in Italy and, indirectly, its subsidiaries. Should the Guarantee granted by the relevant Italian Guarantor be deemed by a court or public authority to be contrary to any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, such Guarantee could be declared null and void. The Notes documents will provide that, if and to the extent such Guarantee would result in a breach of any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code applicable to the relevant guarantor, the relevant guarantor will be deemed to have no liability thereunder and the relevant Guarantees shall not be in force and effect. In addition to the foregoing, and with particular reference to the Guarantees granted by any guarantor incorporated in Italy, the first-priority ranking of the Collateral securing such Guarantees can be affected by a variety of factors, including the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under applicable law. Furthermore, the Guarantees will be subject to exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, whether on or after the date the Notes are first issued. The existence of such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Guarantees, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Guarantees. Finally, there is some uncertainty under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in, nor are directly parties to, a guarantee (including the Guarantees) will be validly secured and/or can be enforced. Due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of guarantees and the enforceability of the latter, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the relevant Security Agent (“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of, inter alia, the relevant guarantor owed to holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture, as applicable (“Principal Obligations”). All or part of the guarantees (including the Guarantees) will be granted to the Security Agent as guarantees for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations, if permitted by local law. Under the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the guarantees granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct guarantees and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such guarantees except through the Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct in financing transactions, including credit facilities and bond issuances, has generally not been tested under all each jurisdiction, and to the extent that the guarantees in the Guarantees created to secure the Parallel Debt construct are not validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such guarantees. The liabilities and obligations under the Guarantee granted by any French Guarantor (as defined below) are subject to (i) certain exceptions, including to the extent of any obligations which would constitute prohibited financial assistance within ----- the meaning of Article L. 225-216 of the French Commercial Code or infringement of the provisions of Articles L. 241-3, L. 242-6 or L. 244-1 of the French Commercial Code and (ii) French corporate benefit rules. Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition. French law requires that, when a French company grants a guarantee on third-party obligations, the guarantee must be in the corporate purposes and in the corporate interests of the guarantor company. Under French corporate benefit rules, a guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee, taken as a whole. A court could declare any guarantee unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if it found that these criteria were not fulfilled. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance. Accordingly, the Guarantee granted by any French Guarantor and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited, at any time, to an amount equal to the aggregate of the proceeds of the Notes to the extent directly or indirectly on-lent by the Issuer to that French Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries or used to refinance any indebtedness previously directly or indirectly on-lent to that French Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries, in each case under intercompany loans or similar arrangements, and outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such French Guarantor under its guarantee. Any payment made by such French Guarantor under its guarantee in respect of the obligations of any other obligor shall reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount of the intercompany loans or similar arrangements due by such French Guarantor or its subsidiaries under the intercompany loan or similar arrangements referred to above. By virtue of this limitation, the amount of the French Guarantor’s obligations as Guarantor under the Guarantees could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, and the French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation as Guarantor under the Guarantees should the portion of the proceeds of the Notes made available to such French Guarantor directly or indirectly be equal to zero.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

In particular, the Guarantors incorporated in Spain as limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada) will limit their Guarantees by a maximum amount equal to the double of their own funds (recursos propios). In addition, the Guarantees will not guarantee any obligations which imply a breach of, respectively, Spanish financial assistance regulations. Enforcement of any of the Guarantees against any Spanish Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to Spanish Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. These laws and defenses generally include those that relate to financial assistance, corporate interest or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, claw back in insolvency, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses is applicable, a Spanish Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability under its Guarantee depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law.

If Titan Group experiences a change of control repurchase event, it will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes. However, Titan Group's senior secured credit facilities provide that certain change of control events constitute an event of default or mandatory prepayment event under the senior secured credit facilities. Such an event of default entitles the lenders thereunder to, among other things, cause all outstanding debt obligations under the senior secured credit facilities to become due and payable and to proceed against the collateral securing the senior secured credit facilities. Any event of default or ----- acceleration of the senior secured credit facilities will likely also cause a default under the terms of other indebtedness of Titan Group. In addition, the Credit Facilities Agreement contain, and any future credit facilities or other agreements to which Titan Group becomes a party may contain restrictions on its ability to offer to repurchase the Notes in connection with a change of control or otherwise. In the event a change of control repurchase event occurs at a time when it is prohibited from offering to purchase the Notes, Titan Group could seek consent to offer to purchase the Notes or attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such a prohibition. If it does not obtain the consent or refinance the borrowings, Titan Group would remain prohibited from offering to purchase the Notes. In such case, the failure by Titan Group to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture governing the Notes, which, in turn, could result in amounts outstanding under any future credit facility or other agreement relating to indebtedness being declared due and payable.

Modified rules apply in the UK in respect of insolvency proceedings opened after December 31, 2020 pursuant to the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (which provide for a broader set of circumstances in which a company may enter insolvency proceedings in the UK than applied previously). In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdictions the insolvency or similar proceedings would first be commenced or how these proceedings would be resolved. Proceedings could be initiated in the Netherlands, England and Wales, France, Germany, Italy or Spain, or any other relevant jurisdiction, and your rights under the Notes and the Guarantees and your security interests in the Collateral will be subject to the insolvency and administrative laws of the Netherlands, England and Wales, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. ----- The insolvency laws of foreign jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the bankruptcy laws of the United States, or certain other jurisdictions you may be familiar with, and there can be no assurance that you will be able to enforce your rights effectively in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or other proceedings. In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Issuer and of the Guarantors’ jurisdictions of organization or incorporation may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other and those of the United States, including in the areas of the rights of secured and other creditors, the priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain postpetition interest and the duration of the proceedings. In particular, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement could be limited in scope and effect by Italian or Spanish courts to the extent their covenants and provisions, which are untested under Italian case law, could be considered to conflict with mandatory provisions of Italian or Spanish law, as applicable. In the event that the Guarantor incorporated in Italy or Spain experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings or their duration (which may be significantly longer than the duration of analogous proceedings in jurisdictions you may be familiar with). As a consequence, enforcement of rights under the Notes and the Guarantees in an insolvency situation may be delayed and be complex and costly for creditors. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law _Considerations.”_ The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s laws should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes and the Guarantees and your security interests in the Collateral in these jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive. See “Limitations on _Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” with_ respect to certain of the jurisdictions listed above. Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of a Guarantee against a Guarantor. In certain circumstances the court may also void a Guarantee if the company is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes. In and outside of an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Issuer or guarantor of the Notes or the appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the Notes, the security, the Guarantees, and intercompany obligations generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to: - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of the security or a guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee; - direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts received pursuant to any security or paid under a Guarantee to the relevant security provider or guarantor of the Notes or to a fund for the benefit of the guarantor’s creditors; and - take other action that is detrimental to you. If Titan Group cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any security or Guarantee is found to be a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, Titan Group cannot assure you that Titan Group can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each guarantor of the Notes under its Guarantees will be limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the security providers and Guarantors may also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the possibility that an entire Guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. See “Limitations _on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_ In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would, for example, need to find that, at the time the security was granted or the Guarantees were issued, the relevant party: ----- - granted such security or issued such Guarantee with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others (and, in certain jurisdictions, even if the recipient was aware that the guarantor or the collateral provider was insolvent when it granted the guarantee or security interest), or created such security after its insolvency; - granted such security issued such Guarantee in a situation where a prudent business person as a shareholder of such guarantor of the Notes would have contributed equity to such guarantor of the Notes or where the relevant beneficiary of the Guarantee knew or should have known that the guarantor of the Notes was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been made; - received less than reasonably equivalent value for providing such security or incurring the debt represented by the Guarantee on the basis that the security was granted and the Guarantee were incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the security provider’s or guarantor’s benefit, or on some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Guarantee, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons, (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the security provider’s or guarantor’s assets were unreasonably small or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would become due; - the security was granted or the guarantee was entered into within a certain time period prior to the opening date of insolvency proceedings of the guarantor or collateral provider; or - the amount paid or payable was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. Additionally, pursuant to Spanish applicable legislation: - The general rule is that guarantees are ancillary to the guaranteed obligations and therefore are not abstract or independent from such guaranteed obligations. However, under certain circumstances, the Supreme Court admits the validity of first demand guarantees; although the abstract nature of the first demand guarantee and its independence with respect to the principal guaranteed obligation is never absolute. - The laws of Spain may limit the ability of any Spanish guarantor to guarantee debt of a related company or grant security on account of a related company’s debts. These limitations arise from the interpretations of various provisions and from certain general principles of corporate law which include rules governing capital maintenance, under which, among others, the risks associated with a guarantee or the granting of security to guarantee or secure a parent or sister company’s debt need to be reasonable and economically and operationally justified from the guarantor’s or grantor’s perspective. If these limitations were not observed, the guarantees or security granted by any Spanish guarantor could be subject to legal challenge. - Guarantees are affected by a legal rebuttable presumption of detriment for the purposes of a claw back claim (acción rescisoria) to be brought in case of Guarantor insolvency declared in the following two years after the perfection of the Guarantee. The beneficiary of the Guarantor will be able to allege the Guarantor received an equivalent compensation in exchange for providing the Guarantee. Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a guarantor of the Notes generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Guarantee if: - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets; - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute. Although Titan Group believes that Titan Group is solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Acquisition, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a guarantor of the Notes was “insolvent” as of the date security was provided or the Guarantees were issued or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a guarantor of the Notes was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether ----- or not a guarantor of the Notes was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds. For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Guarantees and Security Interests, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency _Law Considerations.”_",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

Pending consummation of the Acquisition, on the Issue Date, the Initial Purchasers will deposit the gross proceeds of the Offering into an Escrow Account. The release of the Escrow Proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the closing of the Acquisition. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” Assuming the release of the proceeds of the Offering from the Escrow Account on or about the Completion Date, we estimate the aggregate gross proceeds from the Offering will be €375 million. We intend to use the proceeds from the Offering, together with borrowings under the Term Loan B Facility and proceeds of shareholder contributions, (i) to pay the purchase price of the Acquisition, (ii) to fund cash on Titan Group’s balance sheet and (iii) to pay the costs, fees and expenses related to the Transactions, including the Offering. We currently expect no amounts to be drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility on the Completion Date. The following table illustrates the estimated sources and uses with respect to the Transactions.

We believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. We note, however, that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our operating results as reported under U.S. GAAP and have limitations as analytical tools. Some of these limitations include the following: (i) they do not reflect capital expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (ii) they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; (iii) they do not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on debt; and (iv) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements. See “ Presentation of Financial and Other _Information – Alternative performance measures (“APMs”)” and “ Risk Factors –Risks Relating to the Acquisition – Titan Group’s ability to operate its business effectively may suffer if it is unable to cost-effectively establish its own administrative and other support functions in order to operate as a standalone company after the expiration of the Transitional Services Agreement with the Crown Group.”_ The calculations for Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA are based on various assumptions, management estimates and unaudited management accounts.

(b) This amount represents the costs and expenses required to operate the Group on a standalone basis. These costs cover substantially the same categories that comprise the amounts under “ Discontinued Corporate Allocations”. Standalone costs are expected to be significantly less than costs incurred under the Discontinued Corporate Allocations. See “ Risk Factors — Risks Relating to the Acquisition — Titan Group’s ability to _operate its business effectively may suffer if it is unable to cost-effectively establish its own administrative and other support functions in order to operate as a standalone company after the expiration of the Transitional Services Agreement with the Crown Group.” Standalone costs are_ based on management estimates and assumptions (including the successful implementation of our standalone strategy) and are forward looking in nature.

It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial impact or results of these actions and initiatives and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. If one or more of our underlying assumptions proves to have been incorrect, this could lead to substantially higher costs than planned and we may not be able to realize fully, or realize in the anticipated time frame, the estimated benefits from our standalone cost-savings. See ""Risk Factors — Risks Relating to the _Acquisition — Titan Group has no operating history as a standalone company and it may not be successful in implementing its strategy as a standalone business.""_ (c) Following the Completion Date, the Business will operate on a stand-alone basis independently of its United States parent. Given that none of the Group’s operations are in the United States, we expect that our reporting currency will shift from the U.S. Dollar to the Euro and we anticipate preparing our financial statements under IFRS. The amounts in this line item represent the estimated impact of operating lease expenses recognized under IFRS 16, which introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees. The amounts in this line item represent the U.S. GAAP operating lease expense from the Audited Combined Financial Statements as a proxy for the IFRS 16 lease liabilities. See Annex A for a discussion of certain differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. A lessee recognizes a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligations to make lease payments. There are optional exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low value items. (d) This adjustment in the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily relates to a $25 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge, incurred related primarily to our aerosols and promotional packaging activities, resulting from the outlook for tinplate aerosol packaging having declined and operating costs in the aerosol and promotional packaging activities having increased, as well as an $8 million restructuring add-back and a $3 million loss on disposal. The adjustment in the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily relates to a $2 million gain on disposal. The Business has undergone a variety of restructuring efforts, primarily related to plant closures in France and Germany in an effort to reduce overall fixed ----- headcount and duplicative positions. Restructuring costs included in this adjustment take account of severance and other general cost associated with implementing the restructuring such as cleaning or stripping plants. (e) Represents the removal of non-operating costs included in pension expense, in particular amortization of prior year unrealized losses related to German pensions. (f) Represents costs associated with discontinued operations in Peru, primarily comprised of VAT expenses and operating losses. The facility in Peru is not part of the Titan Group going forward. (g) This amount normalizes the impact of bad debt expense to $1.1 million per annum based on historical bad debt expense accruals, run-rate and relatively consistent sales year over year over a period of 10 years. (h) Represents (i) expenses in relation to the implementation of a new information technology system in the year ended December 31, 2018 leading to more precise methodologies in monitoring inventory, (ii) recoveries of customer claims from suppliers in relation to defective products, (iii) removal of EBITDA relating to a customer contract which was discontinued in the year ended December 31, 2018, and (iv) normalizing costs in relation to the Business’ UK pension system due to a change from a defined benefit plan to a defined contribution plan in the year ended December 31, 2019. (i) Our Adjusted EBITDA margin amounted to 13.5%, 11.6%, 12.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, and 8.5% and 14.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. (j) This amount represents estimated savings expected to be realized in connection with procurement initiatives for raw materials, in particular tinplate through, inter alia, negotiation of price discounts in place of long payment terms and intensifying cross-functional cooperation to harmonize specifications of raw materials. Pro forma procurement savings are based on management estimates and assumptions (including the successful implementation of certain initiatives) and are forward-looking in nature. As such, this information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our estimates. Any failure by us to successfully execute on our strategy to achieve procurement efficiencies could materially impact our results. See “ Risk Factors – Titan Group has no operating _history as a standalone company and it may not be successful in implementing its strategy as a standalone business.”_ (k) Not meaningful. (2) Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. (3) Capital expenditure includes both maintenance and growth capital expenditure. In the years ended December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2020, growth capital expenditure represented on average approximately 10% of capital expenditures. (4) Free cash flow represents Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures. (5) Cash conversion represents free cash flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA. (6) Volumes represents the number of units sold of food cans only. (7) Pro forma net debt represents our net debt on a pro forma basis for the Transaction, including an aggregate of €375 million under the Notes offered hereby. See “ Capitalization.” Pro forma net debt is presented for illustrative purposes only and is based on a convenience translation of Euro to US Dollar of 1:1.1728. (8) Pro forma net secured debt represents the Term Loan B Facility net of pro forma cash and cash equivalents. See “Capitalization.” Pro forma net secured debt is presented for illustrative purposes only and is based on a convenience translation of Euro to US Dollar of 1:1.1728. (9) Pro forma cash interest expense represents cash pay interest payable under the Credit Facilities Agreement (including the Term Loan B Facility but not including the Revolving Credit Facility) and the cash pay interest payable in respect of the Notes as if the Transaction had occurred on April 1, 2020. This amount does not include any interest on lease liabilities, or any commitment or utilization fees associated with the Senior Facilities Agreement and assumes an imputed weighted average interest rate for the Term Loan B Facility. Pro forma cash interest expense is presented for illustrative purposes only and is based on a convenience translation of Euro to US Dollar of 1:1.162. The Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Condensed Combined Financial Statements included in this Offering Memorandum are based on U.S. GAAP, which differs in certain respects from IFRS. For a discussion of certain significant differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS, see Annex A. Management has undertaken a preliminary analysis to assess the potential impact on the Group’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows from a change from U.S. GAAP to IFRS. Management has determined that the application of IFRS 16 is expected to impact the Group's treatment of leases, in particular with respect to the income statement. For the estimated impact of the application of IFRS 16 on the Group's Adjusted EBITDA, see “Summary Financial and Other Information.” While Management believes that the application of IFRS 16 will be the main impact to the Group’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows as a result of the change from U.S. GAAP to IFRS, the Group has not prepared and is not presenting a reconciliation of the Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Combined Consolidated Financial Statements to IFRS in this Offering Memorandum, and it is possible that such a change could lead to other differences to the Group’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows from the amounts presented in this Offering Memorandum.

257_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Overview,17.1.1,,"We are a European leader in the design, manufacture and sale of metal packaging solutions, with number one or number two market positions across our product groups in the countries we operate in. We are the clear market leader in the 26.7-billion-unit European market for metal food cans and ends, holding the number one market position with an approximate 39% market share based on volume in the year ended December 31, 2020. As the largest European manufacturer of metal food cans and ends and the largest European buyer of tinplate steel (based on our estimated consumption of approximately 20% of total European tinplate production), our business is a critical asset in the European food supply chain. We have been in the industry for more than 200 years and have an established reputation for the highest quality products and exceptional customer service. From the founding of our predecessor business in 1799 to our acquisition by Crown in 1996 and our acquisition of Mivisa in 2014, our business has shown itself to be a leader in European metal packaging time and time again. Following the Transactions, we will become a leading stand-alone business in Europe. Our product portfolio consists predominantly of food packaging, with approximately 95% of our sales in the year ended December 31, 2020 going to food related end markets. Our products are used by hundreds of millions of consumers on a daily basis across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we produced approximately 12 billion food cans, approximately 24 billion ends, approximately 5.3 billion metal closures, approximately 581 million aerosol cans and approximately 134 million metal promotional packaging containers. Our products are used to package food in a diverse array of end-markets, including fruits and vegetables, tomatoes, fish, pet food, culinary, infant nutrition and dairy. Each of our end-markets is driven by fundamental demand drivers that are stable and largely uncorrelated with broader macroeconomic cycles. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

According to leading global consulting firm 2. According to Management estimates We sell our products in more than 90 countries with France, Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy and Germany representing 15%, 14%, 12%, 11% and 7% of our sales, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2020 and other geographies making up the remaining 41% of sales in the same period. Sales to our top 10 customers represented just 32% of our total sales in the year ended December 31, 2020. We benefit from long-standing relationships with our customers, having worked with our top 10 customers for an average of over 25 years. Our business is significantly insulated from raw material price fluctuation through a combination of formulaic and negotiated raw material pass-through mechanisms, providing us with margin stability and consistent historical cash flows. We have demonstrated our ability to pass through fluctuations in the prices of our raw material inputs over the long term. Moreover, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, Titan Group’s pass-through was on track for full recovery of raw material price increases in 2021. Based on Management estimates, the vast majority of sales are covered by at least annual contracts, with up to 40% of total sales secured on multi-year contracts. Our customer contracts provide sales volume visibility, as many contracts stipulate a guaranteed percentage of total customer orders for the term of the contract. We operate 44 strategically located manufacturing facilities (in addition to the Braunstone site, which will be transferred at the end of the transition period) in 17 countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, which enhance our access to customer end-markets and support local demand. Our manufacturing scale is complemented by our services and customer support capabilities including over 20 technical services locations, seven dedicated product design studios, four dedicated laboratory testing facilities and a world-class research and development facility that have put us at the forefront of the European tinplate packaging industry. In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, we had net sales of $2,241 million, $2,138 million and $2,227 million, respectively, and Adjusted EBITDA of $303 million, $247 million and $267 million, respectively. Our net sales and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA were $2,297 million and $317 million, respectively, for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021. These amounts translate, for convenience purposes only, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, to net sales of €1,897 million, €1,910 million and €1,951 million, respectively, and Adjusted EBITDA of €256 million, €221 million and €234 million, respectively, and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, to net sales and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of €1,974 million and €272 million, respectively.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428
257_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.3.1,COVID-19 and Macroeconomic Environment,"In the year ended December 31, 2020 and the three months ended March 31, 2021, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on production and aggregate demand became apparent in all economies. In leading global economies, authorities enacted strong expansionary measures to provide income support to households and firms, provide credit to the economy and bolster market liquidity. The spread of the virus in Europe since the end of February 2020 and the measures adopted to reduce the rate of infection had significant repercussions on economic activity in the year ended December 31, 2020 and the three months ended March 31, 2021. In relation to the Group, the COVID-19 pandemic generated a modest increase in canned food consumption due to more at-home eating, which was partially offset by lower sales of large format cans for the food services industry. In addition, demand for aerosols packaging declined as personal care habits changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales of promotional packaging also declined as marketplaces such as airport shops where such packaging is sold were closed. Overall, we estimate that benefits due to increases in demand for food cans offset losses in volume in our aerosols and promotional packaging activities and increased expenditures, resulting in a net neutral impact to our financial performance. Our manufacturing facilities were deemed system relevant in each jurisdiction in which we operate and remained fully operational throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Our office workforce experienced no disruption since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic due to our ability to swiftly switch all platforms and processes to be functional remotely and to promptly enhance communication channels. Even before the restrictive measures in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic came into effect, we adopted a series of further, voluntary and increasingly stringent precautionary measures in addition to those required by law, with a view to ensuring a greater degree of protection for employees. We leveraged the use of smart working arrangements for those activities that can be carried out remotely, and vacation and paid leave were incentivized. In addition, we took advantage of social safety-net arrangements as appropriate, in conjunction with the introduction of anti-contagion safety protocols, use of personal protection equipment and sanitization of business premises.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

At least 45% of our revenue is generated from sales to seasonal food end-markets. The industry enters its busiest period in the third quarter when the majority of seasonal fruits and vegetables are harvested. Due to the foregoing factors our working capital requirements typically build during the first half of a financial year and decrease during the second half of a financial year. Inventory levels typically increase in the first half of the year to meet peak demand in the second and third quarters. Our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity may therefore be impacted by these seasonal practices.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428
257_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.3.3,Weather Conditions,"Weather conditions can reduce crop yields and adversely affect customer demand for fruit and vegetable cans in any given year. In addition, demand for our seafood packaging is affected by variation in local fish catches. Severe weather conditions associated with climate change such as droughts, hail, floods or frost, are unpredictable and may potentially impact agricultural production which in turn may lead to reduced demand for our products in the regions in which we currently operate.

257_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.3.4,Raw Material Expenses,"Raw materials constitute the substantial majority of our production cost and our total costs of raw materials were $1,196 million, $1,148 million and $1,159 million, or 53.7%, 53.7% and 51.7%, respectively, of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our key raw material input is steel (both tinplate and tin-free forms), which constituted 48.5%, 51.2% and 49.2% of the total cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We believe we are the largest purchaser of tinplate steel in Europe. Our relationships with domestic European steel mills are a key strength of our business and represent a critical strategic advantage compared to our competitors. The cost of steel is affected by a variety of micro and macro factors, primarily based on the supply and demand for steel, market movements in other base metals and geopolitical factors. Importantly, steel is generally purchased under one-year contracts with prices that are fixed for each calendar year, minimizing the intra-year volatility of our primary input cost. We have not experienced any material supply issues related to our key raw materials that impacted our ability to meet customer demand requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that our strong relationships with the leading European suppliers of steel, including committed volume contracts, have allowed us to source steel consistently through a variety of market conditions. We also believe that certain of our competitors are experiencing difficulties in purchasing these raw materials because of a lack of scale. We centrally manage our procurement operations across the Group in order to achieve ----- economies of scale, seek consistency across our relationships across Europe, the Middle East and Africa and provide more certainty for production planning. Changes in the cost of raw materials affect both our net sales and our cost of materials and thus substantially affect our results of operations. However, the price for steel is not often a substantial factor affecting our underlying business performance as we typically pass-through any increases in raw material prices to our customers. Through a combination of contracts which include input cost pass-through provisions and annual price negotiations which also reflect tinplate prices, we have historically been able to minimize margin volatility due to changes in raw material costs. We pass through changes in raw material costs relating to the remainder of our business’s revenues through annual pricing negotiations. Since steel prices are also contracted for on an annual basis, our customer pricing and raw material input cost changes are generally matched. We have been generally able to successfully pass through raw material price fluctuations and maintain largely consistent margins throughout much of our operating history. However, in 2019, Titan offered certain price concessions to capture wallet share and long long-term contracts. This improved revenue certainty at the expense of short short-term margins.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428
257_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.3.5,Foreign Exchange Transactions,"During the periods discussed herein, our reporting currency was the U.S. Dollar, however our sales and revenue and operating costs are realized in other currencies, predominantly the Euro, which represents approximately 74% of our revenue. As a result, our historical financials are exposed to foreign exchange translation fluctuations between such other currencies and the U.S. Dollar. The translation of foreign currencies back to the U.S. Dollar may have a significant impact on our revenues and financial results. Foreign exchange has an unfavorable impact on revenues when the U.S. Dollar is relatively strong as compared with foreign currencies and a favorable impact on revenues when the U.S. Dollar is relatively weak as compared with foreign currencies. Our business has a limited level of transactional currency exposure arising from sales or purchases by operating activities in currencies other than their functional currencies. Assets and liabilities of the Group denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, were translated to U.S. Dollar using the applicable period-end rates of exchange. To counteract seasonal effects, the income, expense and cash flow items were translated to U.S. Dollar at average exchange rates prevailing throughout the applicable period. Translation adjustments are accumulated as a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss). Following the Completion Date, the Business will no longer be part of the Crown Group and hence will be operated independently from its United States parent. Given that none of the Group’s operations are in the United States, we expect that our reporting currency will shift from the U.S. Dollar to the Euro, representing the functional currency in a majority of the jurisdictions in which we operate. While we will remain subject to limited foreign exchange transaction risk, such shift would eliminate the risk arising from currency translation to the U.S. Dollar. We expect this change in reporting currency to have a positive impact on the stability and comparability of our results of operations going forward.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

Not only are steel and aluminum infinitely recyclable, but they also have the highest recycling rates amongst packaging formats. Additionally, according to the Can Manufacturing Institute, recycling saves up to 75% of the energy required to produce virgin steel. Greater environmental consciousness and strong sustainability trends have led to an increased preference for recyclable packaging. Consumers increasingly view sustainability as a key purchasing criteria and seek out more environmentally friendly packaging, which has been further reinforced by regulatory developments. Changes in regulations and ability to reuse materials and produce packaging that is perceived as environmentally friendly can affect both our net sales and our cost of materials and thus substantially affect our results of operations. Metal packaging’s properties position it to benefit from the increasing backlash against the use of plastic products.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

(2) This amount represents the costs and expenses required to operate the Group on a standalone basis. These costs cover substantially the same categories that comprise the amounts under “ Discontinued Corporate Allocations”. Standalone costs are expected to be significantly less than costs incurred under the Discontinued Corporate Allocations. See “ Risk Factors — Risks Relating to the Acquisition — Titan Group’s ability to operate _its business effectively may suffer if it is unable to cost-effectively establish its own administrative and other support functions in order to operate as a standalone company after the expiration of the Transitional Services Agreement with the Crown Group.” Standalone costs are based on_ management estimates and assumptions (including the successful implementation of our standalone strategy) and are forward looking in nature. As such, this information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our estimates. Any failure by us to successfully execute on our standalone strategy could materially impact our results. As such, this information is inherently subject to business, economic and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained ----- in our estimated standalone costs and expenses. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial impact or results of these actions and initiatives and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. If one or more of our underlying assumptions proves to have been incorrect, this could lead to substantially higher costs than planned and we may not be able to realize fully, or realize in the anticipated time frame, the estimated benefits from our standalone cost-savings. See ""Risk Factors — Risks Relating to the Acquisition — Titan Group has no _operating history as a standalone company and it may not be successful in implementing its strategy as a standalone business.""_ (3) Following the Completion Date, the Business will operate on a stand-alone basis independently of its United States parent. Given that none of the Group’s operations are in the United States, we expect that our reporting currency will shift from the U.S. Dollar to the Euro and we anticipate preparing our financial statements under IFRS. The amounts in this line item represent the estimated impact of operating lease expenses recognized under IFRS 16, which introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees. The amounts in this line item represent the U.S. GAAP operating lease expense from the Audited Combined Financial Statements as a proxy for the IFRS 16 lease liabilities. See Annex A for a discussion of certain differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. A lessee recognizes a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligations to make lease payments. There are optional exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low value items. (4) This adjustment in the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily relates to a $25 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge, incurred related primarily to our aerosols and promotional packaging activities, resulting from the outlook for tinplate aerosol packaging having declined and operating costs in the aerosol and promotional packaging activities having increased, as well as an $8 million restructuring add-back and a $3 million loss on disposal. The adjustment in the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily relates to a $2 million gain on disposal. The Business has undergone a variety of restructuring efforts, primarily related to plant closures in France and Germany in an effort to reduce overall fixed headcount and duplicative positions. Restructuring costs included in this adjustment take account of severance and other general cost associated with implementing the restructuring such as cleaning or stripping plants. (5) Represents the removal of non-operating costs included in pension expense, in particular amortization of prior year unrealized losses related to German pensions. (6) Represents costs associated with discontinued operations in Peru, primarily comprised of VAT expenses and operating losses. The facility in Peru is not part of the Titan Group going forward. (7) This amount normalizes the impact of bad debt expense to $1.1 million per annum based on historical bad debt expense accruals, run-rate and relatively consistent sales year over year over a period of 10 years. (8) Represents (i) expenses in relation to the implementation of a new information technology system in the year ended December 31, 2018 leading to more precise methodologies in monitoring inventory, (ii) recoveries of customer claims from suppliers in relation to defective products, (iii) removal of EBITDA relating to a customer contract which was discontinued in the year ended December 31, 2018, and (iv) normalizing costs in relation to the Business’ UK pension system due to a change from a defined benefit plan to a defined contribution plan in the year ended December 31, 2019. (9) Our Adjusted EBITDA margin amounted to 13.5%, 11.6%, 12.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, and 8.5% and 14.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve months ended March 31, 2021 was $317 million. Please see “ Summary Financial and Other Information.” This amount includes estimated savings expected to be realized in connection with procurement initiatives for raw materials, in particular tinplate through, inter alia, negotiation of price discounts in place of long payment terms and intensifying cross-functional cooperation to harmonize specifications of raw materials. Pro forma procurement savings are based on management estimates and assumptions (including the successful implementation of certain initiatives) and are forwardlooking in nature. As such, this information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our estimates. Any failure by us to successfully execute on our strategy to achieve procurement efficiencies could materially impact our results.

This increase was primarily due to higher sales volume in the seasonal foods end markets, including fruits and vegetables, with food can volumes increasing 8.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020, in light of suppressed volumes for the three months ended March 31, 2020 during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, which have normalized for the three months ended March 31, 2021. These trends were offset by lower sales volume in the fish end market for the three months ended March 31, 2021. _Costs of products sold_ Costs of products sold increased by $38 million, or 9.6%, to $434 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 from $396 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. Our costs of products sold as a percentage of net sales decreased by 4.2 percentage points to 81.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2021 from 86.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to an inventory pricing headwind in the three months ended March 31, 2020 caused by a weaker than expected harvest in 2019 which did not repeat in the three months ended March 31, 2021. _Depreciation and amortization_ Depreciation and amortization increased by $1 million, or 7.1%, to $15 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 from $14 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, largely as a result of foreign currency translation, with the Euro appreciating by 9.4% compared to the same period of the prior year. ----- _Selling and administrative expenses_ Selling and administrative expenses increased by $1 million, or 3.8%, to $27 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 from $26 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, largely due to foreign currency translation. The underlying selling and administrative expenses in the operating currencies were lower in the three months ended March 31, 2021 than in the same period of the prior year. _Technology royalty_ Technology royalty increased by $1 million, or 20.0%, to $6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 from $5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, largely due to the increase in sales and associated increased cost allocation. These expenses will not continue to be charged from Crown to the Business following the Completion Date. _Restructuring and other_ We incurred $1 million of restructuring and other costs in the three months ended March 31, 2020 which were primarily related to a loss on disposal of certain assets. We did not incur any such costs in the three months ended March 31, 2021. _Income from operations_ Income from operations increased by $30 million, or 166.7%, to $48 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 from $18 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, largely due to higher sales, lower cost of products sold, lower selling and administrative expenses and foreign currency translation impact. _Interest expense_ Interest expense increased by $1 million, or 100%, to $2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 from $1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. _Provision for income taxes_ Provision for income taxes increased by $4 million, or 66.7%, to $10 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from $6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, largely due to higher income from operations. _Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests_ Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests amounted to $1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily attributable to increased income in our Morocco business due to an increase in volume from a rebound in the fishing industry, partially offset by foreign exchange impact. We reported no net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the three months ended March 31, 2020. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

This increase was primarily due to higher sales unit volumes, with food can volumes increasing 7.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 relative to the prior year due to increased sales of smaller format cans, a better harvest relative to the prior year, as well as a positive impact of foreign currency translation. These impacts were partially offset by the pass-through of lower raw material costs, as changes in raw material costs impact revenue levels by a corresponding amount when they are passed through. _Costs of products sold_ Costs of products sold increased by $62 million, or 3.4%, to $1,867 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $1,805 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales decreased by 0.6 percentage points to 83.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 84.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to operating cost reductions as a result of our continuous improvement initiatives. _Depreciation and amortization_ Depreciation and amortization were effectively flat year-over-year, increasing $1 million, or 1.7% to $59 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $58 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, largely as a result of foreign currency translation, with the Euro appreciating by 1.9% compared to the prior year period. ----- _Selling and administrative expenses_ Selling and administrative expenses increased by $7 million, or 6.7%, to $112 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $105 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, largely due to higher sales expense from increased net sales, as well as the impact of foreign currency translation. _Technology royalty_ Technology royalty decreased by $2 million, or 7.1%, to $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $28 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, largely due to the change in type of sales by country and associated change in allocation. These expenses will not continue to be charged from Crown to the Business following the Completion Date. _Restructuring and other_ Restructuring and other costs decreased by $3 million, or 60.0%, to $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Restructuring costs in each year related to headcount reductions at certain facilities. In the year ended December 31, 2019, these costs were partially offset by gains on the sale of various assets across the Group’s operations. _Goodwill impairment_ We recorded no goodwill impairment in the year ended December 31, 2020, whereas we recorded $25 million goodwill impairment in the year ended December 31, 2019 related primarily to our aerosols and promotional packaging activities. Please refer to the comparison of results for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 for additional detail on this goodwill impairment. _Income from operations_ Income from operations increased by $49 million, or 43.8%, to $161 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $112 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher sales volume and the one time goodwill impairment charge that only impacted the year ended December 31, 2019. _Interest expense_ Interest expense was stable at $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. _Provision for income taxes_ Provision for income taxes increased by $10 million, or 32.3%, to $41 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as the goodwill impairment charge did not recur in the year December 31, 2020. _Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests_ Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by $1 million, or 50.0%, to $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by lower income in our Morocco business due to a decrease in volume from a temporary downturn in the fishing industry. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

This decrease was primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation and lower sales volume due to lower crop yields with food can volumes increasing only 1.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 relative to the prior year, partially offset by the pass-through of higher raw material costs. Moreover, we granted price concessions to certain customers in the year ended December 31, 2019, which led to lower net sales in that year but to increased volumes over the long-term. _Cost of products sold_ Costs of products sold decreased by $38 million, or 2.1%, to $1,805 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $1,843 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales increased by 2.2 percentage points to 84.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 82.2% for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to increased raw material costs, including tinplate steel and other non-metal raw materials, as well as increases in labour, energy and freight and other costs, offset by operating cost reductions as a result of our continuous improvement initiatives. Management decided not to pass-through the increased raw material costs to customers in an effort to gain market share. _Depreciation and amortization_ Depreciation and amortization were effectively flat at $58 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 relative to $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. ----- _Selling and administrative expenses_ Selling and administrative expenses decreased by $6 million, or 5.4%, to $105 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $111 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, largely due to lower selling expenses associated with lower sales volumes, as well as cost saving initiatives implemented in the year. _Technology royalty_ Technology royalty increased by $2 million, or 7.7%, to $28 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 largely due to the change in type of sales by country and associated change in allocation. These expenses will not continue to be charged from Crown to the Business following the Completion Date. _Restructuring and other_ Restructuring and other costs increased by $9 million to a cost of $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from gains of $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which were due to the sale of two food can facilities in the United Kingdom which more than offset restructuring costs associated with headcount reductions. _Goodwill impairment_ We recorded no goodwill impairment in the year ended December 31, 2018, whereas we recorded a $25 million noncash goodwill impairment charge in the year ended December 31, 2019 related to our aerosols and promotional packaging activities, resulting from a determination that fair value had declined below its carrying value due to the outlook for tinplate steel aerosol packaging having declined and operating costs in the aerosol and promotional packaging activities having increased. _Income from operations_ Income from operations decreased by $93 million, or 45.4%, to $112 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $205 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to reduced sales and a goodwill impairment charge incurred in the year ended December 31, 2019. _Interest expense_ Interest expense decreased by $2 million, or 18.2%, to $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. _Provision for income taxes_ Provision for income taxes decreased by $13 million, or 29.5%, to $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $44 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, largely due to reduced income from operations. _Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests_ Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased by $1 million, or 100.0%, to $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily driven by higher income in our Morocco business due to an increase in volume, partially offset by an accounting adjustment in post-retirement benefits and foreign exchange impact.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

Following completion of the Financing, we expect that our primary source of liquidity will be cash flows from operating activities and the Revolving Credit Facility. It is expected that, as of the Completion Date, the Revolving Credit Facility will be undrawn except that in the event that freely available cash on the balance sheet on or about the Completion Date is lower than our estimate or insufficient to support our working capital requirements due to, among other things, a negative movement in working capital, we may draw down amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility on the Completion Date or shortly thereafter. We have used our cash flow to fund operating expenses, working capital, capital expenditures, and capital and interest payments related to our debt obligations. Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operations together with available borrowings and cash on hand, will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity and debt service needs, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes offered hereby, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We believe that the potential risks to our liquidity include: - a reduction in operating cash flows due to a lowering of operating profit from our operations, which could be caused by a downturn in our performance, the industry as a whole or the economy as a whole; - the failure or delay of our customers to make payments due to us; - the failure to maintain low working capital requirements; and - the need to fund expansion and other development capital expenditures. - If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to: - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures; - sell our assets; - obtain additional debt or equity financing; and/or - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. ----- We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all.

For the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 and the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our movements in net working capital were $(242) million, $(231) million, $34 million, $(1) million and $39 million, respectively. The increase in working capital spend from the three months ended March 31, 2020 to the three months ended March 31, 2021 was primarily due to an increase in inventory net of increase in trade payables. The decrease in working capital spend from the year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2020 was a result of a reduction in inventory offset by an increase in trade and other receivables. The slight increase in working capital spend from the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2019 was a result of an increase in inventory offset by an increase in trade and other payables. We anticipate that our working capital requirements in the foreseeable future will generally be stable as a percentage of net sales. We also manage our working capital using a number of accounts receivable financing programs. See “Off Balance _Sheet Arrangements” below. However, these requirements can fluctuate for a variety of factors, including any significant_ increase in receivables due to longer time periods to collect payment from our customers or a substantial increase in the cost of our raw materials. In addition, Titan Group is party to several supply chain financing arrangements, in which a financial institution fulfils our suppliers’ trade receivables on our behalf and we benefit from extended payment terms. In connection with the Acquisition, we expect that certain of these financing arrangements representing an amount of approximately $124 million as of March 31, 2021 of accounts payable extensions will be discontinued. This may temporarily impact our net working capital and liquidity positions, in which case we may draw down amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility to cover any amounts in excess of internally generated cash flows and cash available on balance sheet.

From 2018 to 2020, we invested $98 million in total capital expenditures, of which approximately $9 million was in growth projects. Our historical capital expenditure requirements have been focused on maintaining our existing asset base and improving the health and safety conditions at our facilities. However, there have been several recent growth investments including a new PVC-Free Closure Line, which supports above market growth of PVC Free closures and positions us for highly competitive supply to market. Our estimated capital expenditure budget for the year ended December 31, 2021 is similar to our capital expenditure in the year ended December 31, 2020.

Estimates are evaluated based on available information and experience. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For a summary of significant accounting policies see note B to the Audited Combined Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Throughout the periods covered by the Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Condensed Combined Financial Statements, the Group operated as a part of the Crown Group. Consequently, stand-alone financial statements have not been historically prepared for the Group.

The Group operates in 17 countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and hence currency exchange risk arises from commercial transactions and recognized assets and liabilities. As a result of the Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Condensed Combined Financial Statements being presented in U.S. Dollar, the results of the Group are also impacted by fluctuations in the U.S. Dollar exchange rate versus the functional currencies of the Group, including the Euro (represents approximately 74% of our revenue), the British Sterling and the Moroccan Dirham. Fluctuations in value of these currencies with respect to the U.S. Dollar may have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We believe that a strengthening of the U.S. Dollar exchange rate by 1% against all functional currencies from the December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 rate, respectively, would decrease invested capital by approximately $18 million, $17 million and $19 million in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. On a forward going basis, the Business will report in Euro, which is consistent with the primary functional currency of our operating units. We manage foreign currency exposures at the operating unit level. Exposures that cannot be naturally offset within an operating unit may be hedged with derivative financial instruments where possible and cost effective in our judgment. Foreign exchange contracts generally mature within twelve months. The table below provides information in U.S. Dollars as of March 31, 2021 about the Group’s forward currency exchange contracts. The majority of the contracts expire in 2021 and primarily hedge anticipated transactions and unrecognized firm commitments and are recorded at fair value.

Counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions. These instruments are viewed as risk management tools, involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes.

Our primary raw material, tinplate steel, is not a traded commodity and does not have a commonly accepted index price. Tinplate steel represents approximately 95% of our metal purchases. Despite this dynamic, the nature of our annual tinplate steel pricing negotiations and subsequent pass ----- through pricing strategies to customers for the following year provides a natural hedge as input cost changes are matched to customer price changes. We also purchase aluminum, which represents approximately 5% of our metal purchases. Aluminum is a traded commodity that is regularly quoted on the LME. The risk of changes of the price of aluminum is connected with the common practice of determining the prices in the contracts on the basis of the monthly average sales price of aluminum on the LME. We endeavor to avoid unnecessary risks and limit the impact of threats related to our business to an acceptable level, which is achieved primarily through contracts that pass-through raw material costs to customers and by means of hedging transactions.

We operate in the metal container sectors and our primary operating regions are Europe, the Middle East and Africa, although we serve the global market with certain of our products. Metal packaging is becoming increasingly attractive to brands as their strength and rigidity allows them to be filled at high speeds and easily transported, while their shelf-stable nature means that refrigeration is not required, thereby resulting in further energy savings in the supply chain. The ability to customize and differentiate products supplied in metal containers, through innovative design, shaping and printing, also appeals to our customers. Metal offers performance and convenience for brands compared to alternatives. It acts as a superior barrier to oxygen and light and is resilient, as it can be durable, tamperproof and fire and temperature resistant. Moreover, it is convenient, and can be light and robust, with portable characteristics and easy open and recloseable solutions. When used in the food market, metal has the advantage of retaining nutritional value, without the requirement for preservatives. From a supply chain perspective, metal packaging allows for efficient transportation and storage and is suited to processing on installed high-speed filling lines and retort processes. Despite competition from other formats and materials, metal cans remain a key food packaging format, owing to their attractive value proposition. The use of metal cans as a food packaging format is expected to have modest but stable growth of 0.6% per annum in the Group’s key markets of Western Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, between 2020 and 2025, principally driven by macroeconomic growth, as forecasted by Smithers. Metal packaging is also increasingly attractive to both brands and end-consumers who are increasingly focused on sustainability. Metal packaging has significant advantages compared to other packaging substrates. Recycling rates for steel and aluminum in Europe are 83% and 76%, respectively, according to Metal Packaging Europe, amongst the highest of any substrate. Moreover, metal’s properties never degrade during use or recycling, as a result, metal is considered a permanent material and plays a critical role in the circular economy. Additionally, all unused material in the production process can be recycled back into production, so no metal scrap created in production goes to waste. Beyond recyclability, metal packaging also aids in sustainability on account of its functionality. Superior barrier properties (as described above) compared to other substrates make metal packaging ideal for food preservation, reducing food waste, increasing the accessibility of healthy foods in an economical manner and providing contamination protection, reducing the prevalence of food-borne illnesses. Metal has gained increasing traction with brand owners who want to meet their own goals and commitments for sustainability to satisfy their own end-consumers preferences. Companies such as Nestle and Princes Group, both key customers of Titan Group, have stated that they intend to use 100% recyclable or reusable packaging by 2025, and Nestle has announced that they will entirely eliminate the use of ten problematic plastics in their packaging by 2024. Products in the EMEA region’s food can industry are concentrated amongst three food can types: 3-Piece, 2-Piece Drawn and Wall Ironed (“DWI”) and 2-piece Draw Redraw (“DRD”). 3-Piece is a well-established, lower cost steel can with flexible sizes that is used for almost all end-markets, including fish, culinary, pet and nutritional. 2-Piece Drawn Wall Ironed is typically made of steel and has low production costs, high potential for down gauging and fewer can failure modes (with no side seam or end seam) used mostly for seasonal, culinary and pet food end-markets. 2-Piece Draw Redraw is made from steel or aluminum. This is used for shallower cans, offering a wide variety of shapes and high-quality printing. This can mostly serves the fish, culinary and pet food end-markets. Most of the sales in the EMEA region are concentrated in the 3-Piece steel cans, making up 73% of sales, with 2-Piece Aluminum, 2-Piece Steel and other can types making up 11%, 15%, and 1% of can sales in the EMEA market, respectively, as of October 2020, according to Management estimates. Titan Group’s product offering is aligned with the market. 74% of our sales are 3-Piece Steel, and 2-Piece Aluminum and 2-Piece Steel make up 4% and 22% of our sales in the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively. Metal packaging manufacturers hold a critical position in the EMEA food packaging supply chain. Tinplate is the main raw material used in metal packaging production, with approximately 90% of all tinplate produced being used for packaging products according to a leading global consulting firm. This creates an important dynamic between tin manufacturers and can producers. Tinplate manufacturers rely on can manufacturers for a stable source of demand. As EU’s largest buyer of tinplate, consuming 20% of all production in 2019 according to Management estimates, Titan Group represents a critical partner to all major tinplate suppliers in Europe. On the consumers’ side, food producers and can fillers are highly fragmented and are ----- dependent on the quality, safety and availability of cans. The critical position of can manufacturers in the value chain between tinplate producers and food producers and can fillers provides staying power and margin expansion opportunities.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

Collectively, the top two participants in the market hold a combined market share of over 65% based on 2019 / 2020 volume, with no other manufacturer having a market share of greater than 3% according to leading global consulting firm. Other manufacturers consist of mostly regional or local manufacturers, which are limited in scale and footprint to serve customers on a pan-European basis. The European food cans and ends packaging market is relatively insulated from imports given the uneconomical cost of shipping finished metal packaging long distances. In addition, due to the time sensitive nature of customers’ requirements, customers prefer shorter supply chains, benefiting manufacturers that are located nearby to customers. Furthermore, new challengers in the markets face significant obstacles in the form of high barriers to entry for numerous reasons. Sizable capital requirements are needed to add capacity, particularly in the front-end of operations such as coil cutting, printing and lacquering. Additionally, new entrants find economic benefits of adding capacity limited, especially in mature markets with entrenched customers. There are also rigorous qualification requirements demanded by sensitive food end-markets. Additionally, many customers have filling lines which are tuned to work with certain suppliers, resulting in high switching costs and creating a barrier for new entrants in the market. Lastly, inherent strengths of the metal substrate, including rigidity and corrosion resistance, provides tinplate with a degree of protection against substitution from other substrates like aluminum or plastics.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

In Europe, the food cans industry sold approximately 26.7 billion units in 2020 according to a leading global consulting firm, representing a CAGR of 0.2% since 2015. Specifically, many key food end-markets including fruit & vegetables, shelf stable fish, culinary (such as baked beans), pet food and infant formula have shown resilience over time. According to a leading global consulting firm analysis representing trends for European food cans volume sold, market growth of fruits & vegetables, culinary and pet food have each fluctuated by CAGRs of less than +/-1% between 2015 and 2020. Shelf stable fish, culinary and pet food are expected to fluctuate by CAGRs of less than +/-1% between 2020 and 2024, with infant nutrition expected to grow by a CAGR of 1.0% from 2020 to 2023. Fruits & vegetables are expected to decline by a CAGR of 1.4% between 2020 and 2024. Shelf stable foods represent a consumer diet staple across most cultures and geographies. Metal cans currently represent the best barrier material and provides over two years of shelf-life, which is critical for managing seasonal harvest cycles. This shelf-life helps maintain the availability of the underlying food product for consumers, should there be a poor harvest of the relevant item during this two-year period. In 2020, shelf stable foods experienced additional growth attributed to an increase in at-home meal consumption and evolving consumer preferences due to the COVID-19 pandemic, although this benefit was somewhat offset by reduced demand for food cans in food service applications. A majority of the recent demand increases and underlying trends are forecast to persist according to a leading global consulting firm, with sustainability trends expected to provide favorable long-term market tailwinds. These developments are supported by recent innovations into convenient, single-serve packaging offerings. Pet food and infant nutrition represent particular areas of potential growth. The dog and cat populations in Europe continue to increase and pet owners have demonstrated a willingness to spend considerable sums on their pets. Furthermore, Europe exports a significant amount of infant nutrition products and over the past 10 years over $1 billion has been invested in Europe for filling infant nutrition into metal cans.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

We are the clear market leader in the 26.7-billion-unit European market for metal food cans and ends, holding the number one market position with an approximate 39% market share based on volume in the year ended December 31, 2020. As the largest European manufacturer of metal food cans and ends and the largest European buyer of tinplate steel (based on our estimated consumption of approximately 20% of total European tinplate production), our business is a critical asset in the European food supply chain. We have been in the industry for more than 200 years and have an established reputation for the highest quality products and exceptional customer service. From the founding of our predecessor business in 1799 to our acquisition by Crown in 1996 and our acquisition of Mivisa in 2014, our business has shown itself to be a leader in European metal packaging time and time again. Following the Transactions, we will become a leading stand-alone business in Europe. Our product portfolio consists predominantly of food packaging, with approximately 95% of our sales in the year ended December 31, 2020 going to food related end markets. Our products are used by hundreds of millions of consumers on a daily basis across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we produced approximately 12 billion food cans, approximately 24 billion ends, approximately 5.3 billion metal closures, approximately 581 million aerosol cans and approximately 134 million metal promotional packaging containers. Our products are used to package food in a diverse array of end-markets, including fruits and vegetables, tomatoes, fish, pet food, culinary, infant nutrition and dairy.

No single customer represented more than 8% of our sales in the year ended December 31, 2020, with our top 10 customers representing 32% of sales for the same period. Our customers include blue-chip, global food and consumer businesses including Abbott, Bonduelle, Danone, Nestle and Unilever, large national and regional food companies, as well as many smaller and independent fisheries and farmers. We benefit from long-standing relationships with our customers, having worked with our top 10 customers on average for over 25 years. We are the sole or main supplier for several of our top customers. We believe that the quality of our products, our track record of providing reliable supply proven over decades and the significant costs to customers involved in switching manufacturers creates customer stickiness. Before a manufacturing plant or line can begin manufacturing new can SKUs for a customer, its products typically must be qualified through a process that can take several months to over a year. In addition, can manufacturers may face downtime on their lines when running new SKUs, thereby impacting customers’ security and reliability of supply. Customers who decide to change manufacturers also typically lose the benefit of volume rebates from former suppliers and face uncertainty regarding the stability, reliability and quality of their new partners. Customers praise our technological know-how, understanding of their requirements and ability to produce and deliver large volumes of specialty food cans consistently on time and in full. Our customers incur high costs if their packaging is not delivered when required. As an example, tomatoes must be sealed in their packaging within six hours of being picked to ensure their freshness, often requiring our manufacturing facilities to ship dozens of truckloads of food cans per day in a continuous rotation to certain customer facilities during harvest season. We are recognized as an industry leader in product development and deliver solutions that offer greater consumer convenience and functionality in response to market demands. Can fillers require producers who can satisfy their branding, quality and safety needs.

Sustainability- and consumer-driven tailwinds benefit metal packaging,"Our metal packaging products are favorably positioned to benefit from the increase in demand for sustainable packaging given their infinitely recyclable nature. Greater environmental consciousness and strong sustainability trends are expected to support an increased preference for metal packaging over the long-term. End consumers increasingly view sustainability as a key purchasing criteria and seek out more environmentally friendly packaging. Food producers – our customers – are aggressively responding to this demand. For example, several major food conglomerates have announced that they aim to sell mostly recyclable or reusable materials by 2025. These trends are further reinforced by regulatory developments. For example, the EU circular economy plan adopted in 2020 has a clear focus on recyclable packaging, which is likely to put pressure on plastic in favor of other packaging materials. Metal packaging provides excellent options for the sustainability initiatives of companies and brands, since metal properties do not degrade during use or recycling. Consumers already recognize metal packaging as a highly recyclable substrate, evidenced by recycling rates of over 80% for steel and 75% for aluminum in Europe, and food brands increasingly want to position themselves as environmentally friendly. As a further sustainability benefit, metal packaging’s superior barrier properties make it ideal for food preservation, which reduces food waste. Metal packaging increases the accessibility of healthy foods in an economical manner and provides contamination protection, thereby reducing the prevalence of food-borne illnesses. ----- Within the metal packaging industry, we are a European leader in sustainability awareness as a Co-Founder of the Metal Packaging Europe Association and an active participant in other major sustainability focused associations, which serve as conduits for sustainability reform at the regulatory and legislative level.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

Attractive financial profile with flexible cost structure and ability to generate consistent free cash flow,"We have a strong track-record of robust free cash flow generation and cash conversion as a result of our flexible cost structure and resilient cash flows. We generated average annual free cash flow of $239 million and an average cash conversion rate of approximately 88% from 2018 to 2020. Our business is significantly insulated from raw material price fluctuation through a combination of formulaic and negotiated pass-through mechanisms, providing us with consistent historical cash flows and supporting our margins. We have demonstrated our ability to pass through fluctuations in the prices of our raw material inputs over the long term. Based on Management estimates, the vast majority of sales are covered by at least annual contracts, with up to 40% of total sales secured on multi-year contracts. Our customer contracts provide sales volume visibility, as many contracts stipulate a guaranteed percentage of total customer orders for the term of the contract. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, over 97% of Titan Group’s pricing for 2021 was already agreed.

Metal cans represent the best barrier material and provide a shelf life of over two years while still retaining the freshness of the food being packaged. In addition, metal food cans provide a host of other benefits to our customers, including i) allowing for fast filling speeds with limited loss, ii) having high strength and allowing for ease of handling and iii) being resistant to corrosion, thereby allowing for high-acid contents (e.g., tomatoes). These qualities make our products highly costeffective solutions for our customers and limit the threat of substitution from other substrates.

In addition, we will have the benefit of a steady capital expenditure program that is focused on our business, allowing us to pursue multi-year growth projects which we were unable to pursue under prior ownership. End-markets such as infant nutrition and wet petfood have volume growth opportunities at attractive margins that we believe we can capture by employing our capabilities and expertise developed in other end-markets. Our metal cans are well-positioned to benefit from these growth opportunities in light of their favorable barrier properties and the premium perception and convenience that our products offer. In addition, we are focused on growing our share and penetration in key emerging markets such as Eastern Europe and Africa, where our existing customers are establishing footprints that we can readily support with existing technologies and know-how.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

Procurement Optimization,"Tinplate steel makes up for more than 80% of our raw materials spend and represented 48% of our cost of products sold in the year ended December 31, 2020. We believe our market position enables us to optimize sourcing and pricing for our tinplate steel purchases and provides further opportunities for margin expansion. While the Business under Crown’s ownership mainly focused on ensuring stability of supply and favorable working capital arrangements, as a stand-alone business we will have the opportunity to manage supply arrangements in support of better margins, including through utilizing a greater share of raw materials from low cost countries. We have developed optimization initiatives to realize the most favorable pricing with suppliers for the highest quality tinplate with the shortest supply chain lead times. There is potential for additional cost savings opportunities in the form of reduced spend on logistics, raw material specification complexity reductions, indirect cost savings and contract structure improvements. We believe there is an opportunity to purchase higher volume of fewer SKUs, and also consolidate production of precursor products into fewer facilities, thereby reducing the number of facilities receiving raw material shipments and to improve the structure of certain of our contracts. In addition, we believe there are opportunities to optimize indirect and other materials procurement through targeted sourcing initiatives. In the three months ended March 31, 2021, Titan Group already realized the benefit of improved procurement practices and commercial efforts, leading to expanding margins for this period.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

Manufacturing Optimization,"We expect to realize further efficiencies by improving the asset utilization and productivity of our manufacturing footprint. We intend to employ targeted capital expenditures focused on modernizing the equipment used at several of our key facilities with a goal of increasing the capacity of those facilities and allowing more efficient and cost-effective production while reducing the number of facilities in our network. Our Business grew substantially following the acquisition of Mivisa in 2014, however, we did not fully integrate the Mivisa and legacy manufacturing footprints and did not achieve the margin targets or synergies forecast at the time. We believe that there are certain manufacturing function overlaps and duplications as a result of the acquisition and our organic growth. We intend to replicate the “hub and spoke” operating model, used successfully by Mivisa, whereby certain functions that can easily and cost-effectively be transported are completed at lower cost plants to improve and optimize asset utilization. For example, we believe that the manufacturing of ends and certain upstream functions such as metal processing and coating can be consolidated into facilities that specialize in production of those precursor products. Such products would then be transported to existing can finishing or assembly plants that are located close to our customers and have a lean operating footprint. This approach was successfully developed at Mivisa, which operated the largest ends production facility in the world in Murcia, Spain, producing more than 9 billion ends annually and serviced nearly its entire network using this plant and also serviced a significant export business of ends. We intend to replicate this model across the Group’s existing manufacturing footprint.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

Commercial Excellence and Continuous Improvement Initiatives,"In addition to revenue improvement and market share capture, our strategy also has a strong focus on delivering further cost savings and unlocking further margin improvement potential. We plan to develop a continuous improvement culture and ----- invest in training across the entire business. KPS and Management have conducted a comprehensive and granular review of our operating model. We believe that as a stand-alone business, we will be able to realize these cost savings and margin expansions based on KPS’ proven track record in realising improvements in manufacturing businesses. We have identified a number of commercial excellence and continuous improvement priorities, including (i) more focused deployment of capital expenditures, (ii) quality management in the form of manufacturing and operational excellence initiatives; (iii) maintenance and repair optimization, (iv) using a local sales force to improve engagement between our sales and operations teams and (v) a focus on customer service, innovation and responsiveness initiatives. As a stand-alone business focused on the manufacturing of food cans and ends, we will be more readily able to pursue these opportunities rather than having to compete with the other capital priorities of our former owner. Our planned capital projects include investments focused on asset productivity, such as tooling upgrades to multi-die presses and high speed printing and coating lines capable of delivering up to 300% improvements in productivity. Our planned capital projects typically have a payback of approximately two to three years. We also believe there is an opportunity to improve the effectiveness of our commercial function by streamlining our financial reporting structure, providing greater visibility to our local sales teams and enabling them to optimize the margin profile of products they are selling.

257_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,212,BUSINESS,212.13,Materials and Suppliers,212.13.1,,"The Group uses various raw materials, primarily tinplate steel, in its manufacturing operations. In general, these raw materials are purchased in highly competitive, price-sensitive markets which have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality. These and other materials used in the manufacturing process have historically been available in adequate supply from multiple sources. Generally, the Group’s principal raw materials are obtained from the major suppliers in the regions in which it operates plants. Titan Group estimates that it sources approximately 75-80% of its tinplate from the largest three European suppliers and up to 25% from European challengers and imports from outside Europe, including China, Japan, Turkey and South Korea. Some plants in less developed countries, which do not have local mills, obtain raw materials from nearby, more developed countries. The Group has agreements for what it considers adequate supplies of raw materials. However, sufficient quantities may not be available in the future due to, among other things, shortages due to excessive demand, weather or other factors, including disruptions in supply caused by raw material transportation or production delays. From time to time, some of the raw materials have been in short supply but, to date, these shortages have not had a significant impact on the Group’s operations. See also “Risk Factors––Titan Group's financial results could be materially adversely affected if Titan Group is not able to _secure sufficient quantities of raw materials or if the price of raw materials or energy rises and Titan Group cannot increase the price of its products.”_ In the year ended December 31, 2020, consumption of tinplate steel represented approximately 48% of consolidated cost of products sold, excluding depreciation and amortization. Due to the significance of tinplate steel to overall cost of products sold, raw material efficiency is a critical cost component of the products manufactured. Supplier consolidations, changes in ownership, government regulations, political unrest and increased demand for raw materials in the packaging and other industries, among other risk factors, provide uncertainty as to the availability of and the level of prices at which the Group might be able to source such raw materials in the future. Moreover, the price of raw materials can be subject to significant volatility. The Group’s raw material supply contracts vary as to terms and duration, with tinplate steel contracts typically one year in duration with fixed prices for the year. The Group generally attempts to mitigate its steel price risk by matching its purchase obligations with its sales agreements; however, there can be no assurance that the Group will be able to fully mitigate that risk. See also “Risk Factors––Titan Group's financial results could be materially adversely affected if Titan Group is not _able to secure sufficient quantities of raw materials or if the price of raw materials or energy rises and Titan Group cannot increase the price of its products.”_ There can be no assurance that the Group will be able to fully recover from its customers the impact of raw material price increases or that the use of derivative instruments will effectively manage the Group’s exposure to price volatility. In addition, if the Group is unable to purchase raw materials, particularly tinplate steel, for a significant period of time, its operations would be disrupted and if the Group were unable to fully recover the higher cost of those raw materials, its financial results may be adversely affected. The Group continues to monitor this situation and the effect on its operations. As a result of continuing international supply and demand pressures, other commodity-related costs affecting the Group’s business may increase as well, including natural gas, electricity and freight-related costs. The Group will attempt to increase prices on its products accordingly in order to recover these costs. In response to the volatility of raw material prices, ongoing productivity and cost reduction efforts in recent years have focused on improving raw material cost management. The Group’s manufacturing facilities are dependent, in varying degrees, upon the availability of water and processed energy, such as natural gas and electricity. Certain of these may become difficult or impossible to obtain on acceptable terms due to external factors which could increase the Group’s costs or interrupt its business. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

The local court order authorizing the inspection cited FCO suspicions of anti-competitive agreements in the market for the supply of metal packaging products. The Group conducted an internal investigation into the matter and discovered instances of inappropriate conduct by certain employees of German subsidiaries of the Group. The Group cooperated with the FCO and submitted, in September and October 2015, a leniency application with the FCO which disclosed the findings of its internal investigation to date. In April 2018, the FCO discontinued its national investigation and referred the matter to the European Commission (the “Commission”). Following the referral, Commission officials conducted unannounced inspections of the premises of several metal packaging manufacturers, including Group subsidiaries in Germany, France and the United Kingdom. The Commission’s investigation is ongoing and, to date, the Commission has not officially charged the Group or any of its subsidiaries with violations of competition law. The Group is cooperating with the Commission and submitted a leniency application in April 2018. This application may lead to the reduction of possible future penalties. At this stage of the investigation the Group believes that a loss is probable but is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the Commission’s ----- investigation and is unable to estimate the loss or possible range of losses that could be incurred, and has therefore not recorded a charge in connection with the actions by the Commission. If the Commission finds that the Group or any of its subsidiaries violated competition law, fines levied by the Commission as well as third party damage claims by private enforcement, class action or individual claims and any related costs and damages could be material to the Company’s operating results and cash flows for the periods in which they are resolved or become reasonably estimable. In the Acquisition Agreement, Crown has agreed to indemnify us for certain losses in connection with this investigation. In March 2018, the French Competition Authority started a preliminary investigation regarding possible infringements to French competition law with respect to the switch to bisphenol-A free cans in France which implemented legislation restricting the use of bisphenol-A in all recipients as of 1 January 2015. The French Syndicat National des Fabricants _de Boîtes, a trade association representing food can suppliers in France of which Titan Group is a member, received a_ questionnaire from the French Competition Authority asking for information regarding the trade association’s activities in relation to the development of BPA-NI cans. The French Competition Authority opened formal proceedings regarding possible infringements of competition law in relation to the switch to bisphenol-free cans in France in September 2019. In the context of the formal proceedings, the French Competition Authority sent, in January and February 2020, two questionnaires to Titan Group relating to its activities, internal organization and identification of its different entities and their respective turnovers. In January 2021, Titan Group received a request from the French Competition Authority asking for the permission to declassify documents previously provided by Titan Group in response to the questionnaires received and Titan Group gave the French Competition Authority the permission to do so. The French Competition Authority's investigation is ongoing and, to date, Titan Group has not received any further requests nor questionnaires from the French Competition Authority. At this stage of the investigation, Titan Group is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the French Competition Authority's investigation and is unable to estimate the loss that it could incur. Should the Board of the French Competition Authority finds that Titan Group or any of its subsidiary violated French competition law, the fine levied by the French Competition Authority (the amount of which is determined on a case-by-case basis depending notably on the seriousness of the infringement as well as its duration, but capped at 10% of the worldwide turnover of the undertaking) could be material to Titan's Group's operating results and cash flows for the periods in which they are resolved or become reasonably estimable, as well as third party damage claims by private enforcement. In the Acquisition Agreement, Crown has agreed to indemnify Titan Group for certain losses in connection with this investigation. In addition to the above legal matter, we are involved in certain other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our business. We believe none of these additional legal proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations or cash flows. See “Titan Group is subject to an _investigation by the European Commission relating to potential anti-competitive behavior and the outcome of this investigation or future investigations could materially adversely affect Titan Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.”_ -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

For loans denominated in dollars, the rate will be based on the London Interbank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”) until switching on 31 December 2021 to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. For loans denominated in Sterling or euro, the rate will be based on the Sterling Over Night Index Average Rate (“SONIA”) or the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) respectively. In each case, an applicable margin will be added to the interest rate, which (following the first full fiscal quarter commencing after the Completion Date) will be subject to a decreasing margin ratchet based on the Group’s consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio.

The duty of care owed (whether under the Intercreditor Agreement or under general law) by the Common Security Agent to the Second Lien Creditors shall be the same whether or not the Second Lien Creditors are a creditor of the relevant entity in respect of which Enforcement Action is being taken or are beneficiaries of the security which is being enforced. The Common Security Agent is obliged to promptly notify the Second Lien Creditors of the scheduling of any proceedings in relation to any Enforcement Action with respect to the Common Collateral. Furthermore, each of the Secured Parties and the Debtors acknowledges that, in the event that the Common Security Agent enforces, or is instructed to enforce, any Common Collateral on or after the Senior Secured Discharge Date but prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the duties of the Common Security Agent and of any receiver or delegate owed to any Senior Subordinated Notes finance party in respect of the method, type and timing of that enforcement or of the exploitation, management or realization of any of that Common Collateral shall (subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement) be no different to or greater than the duty that is owed by the Common Security Agent, receiver or delegate to the Debtors under general law. _Security Held by Other Creditors_ If any Common Collateral is held by a creditor other than the Common Security Agent, then creditors may only enforce that Common Collateral in accordance with instructions given by an Instructing Group in accordance with the provisions described in this section captioned “—Enforcement of Security” (and for this purpose references to the Common Security Agent shall be construed as references to that creditor). If any Senior Subordinated Collateral is held by a creditor other than the Independent Security Agent, then creditors may only enforce that Senior Subordinated Collateral in accordance with instructions given by the Majority Senior Subordinated Creditors in accordance with the provisions described in this section captioned “—Enforcement of Security” (and for this purpose references to the Independent Security Agent shall be construed as references to that creditor). _Consultation Period_ Subject to paragraph the paragraph below, before giving any instructions to the relevant Security Agent to (i) enforce the security or (ii) take any other Enforcement Action, the Agent(s) of the Creditors represented in the Instructing Group concerned shall consult with each other Agent and the Security Agent in good faith about the instructions to be given by the Instructing Group for a period of up to 15 days (or such shorter period as each other Agent and the relevant Security Agent shall agree) (the “Consultation Period”), and only following the expiry of a Consultation Period, shall the Instructing Group be entitled to give any instructions to the Security Agent to (i) enforce the security or (ii) take any other Enforcement Action. No Agent shall be obliged to consult in accordance with the paragraph above and the Instructing Group shall be entitled to give any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the security or take any other Enforcement Action prior to the end of a Consultation Period if: (i) the security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event; or (ii) the Instructing Group or any Agent of the Creditors represented in the Instructing Group determines in good faith (and notifies each other Agent and the relevant Security Agent) that to enter into such consultations and thereby delay the commencement of enforcement of the security would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on: (A) the relevant Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the security; or (B) the realization proceeds of any enforcement of the security.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

and (B) (if the Common Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend that any Transferee will be treated as a Secured Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement), to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all (and not part only) of the liabilities owed to the Secured Creditors and all or part of any other liabilities and the Debtor liabilities, on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors and Debtors; (v) if the asset which is subject to the Distressed Disposal, Exit Disposal or Foreclosure consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Common Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all or any part of the Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of any subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of the intra-group liabilities or the Debtor liabilities, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to: (A) agree to the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or Debtor liabilities on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to which those obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations;

In the case of a Distressed Disposal or an Exit Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities) effected by, or at the request of, the Common Security Agent, the Common Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions (although the Common Security Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal, Exit Disposal or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher price). If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors are entitled to give, and have given, instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Common Security Agent is not authorized to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, Bilateral Facility letter of credit, an ancillary ----- facility or a Bilateral Facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor), following that release.

Where borrowing liabilities in respect of any Senior Secured Liabilities or any Second Lien Liabilities would otherwise be released pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the creditor concerned may elect to have those borrowing liabilities transferred to the Issuer or Topco, in which case the Common Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor) to execute such documents as are required to so transfer those borrowing liabilities. Subject to the below paragraph, in the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of Liabilities pursuant to the above paragraph (iv)(B)) effected by or at the request of the Security Agent (acting in accordance with paragraph falling two paragraphs below), unless the consent of each Senior Agent and Senior Secured Notes Trustee is otherwise obtained, it is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal under the second paragraph of this section “Distressed Disposals and Foreclosures” above that: - the proceeds of such disposal are in cash (or substantially all in cash); and - such sale or disposal is made: (A) pursuant to a public auction in respect of which the Secured Creditors are entitled to participate; or (B) where a Financial Adviser selected by the Common Security Agent has delivered an opinion in respect of such sale or disposal that the amount received in connection therewith is fair from a financial point of view, taking into account all relevant circumstances, including the method of enforcement, provided that the liability of such Financial Adviser may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement (it being acknowledged that the Common Security Agent shall have no obligation to select or engage any Financial Adviser unless it shall have been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction). If prior to the Second Lien Discharge Date, the Senior Subordinated Discharge Date or the first date on which all Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan Liabilities have been discharged (the “Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan Discharge Date”), a Distressed Disposal or an Exit Disposal is being effected such that the Second Lien Liabilities or the Senior Subordinated Guarantee Liabilities and/or Common Collateral and/or the Senior Subordinated Proceeds Loan Liabilities will be released pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, it is a further condition to the release that either: - the Second Lien Creditor Representative and/or the Senior Subordinated Creditor Representative, and/or a Senior Subordinated Issuer/Borrower (as applicable) has approved the release; or - where shares or assets of a Second Lien Issuer/Borrower or guarantor in respect of Second Lien Liabilities (a “Second Lien Guarantor”) or Senior Subordinated Guarantor are sold: (A) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash) and/or other marketable securities or, if the proceeds of such sale or disposal are not in cash (or substantially in cash) and/ or other marketable securities, the requirements of paragraph (C)(II) below are satisfied; (B) all claims of the Senior Secured Creditors and (if applicable) Second Lien Creditors against a member of the ICA Group (if any), all of whose shares are pledged in favor of the creditors in respect of the Priority Secured Liabilities (the “Priority Secured Creditors”) are sold or disposed of pursuant to such Enforcement Action, are unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all security under the security documents in respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with such sale, provided that in the event of a sale or disposal of any such claim (instead of a release or discharge): (I) where the Senior Secured Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Senior Agent and Senior Secured Notes Trustee (i) determine, acting reasonably and in good faith, that the Senior Secured ----- Creditors will recover a greater amount if any such claim was released or discharged, and (ii) serve a notice on the Common Security Agent notifying the Common Security Agent of the same; and (II) where the Second Lien Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Second Lien Agent and the Second Lien Notes Trustee (i) determine acting reasonably and in good faith that the Priority Secured Creditors (collectively) will recover more than if such claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or one of its Affiliates and not released or discharged, and (ii) serve a written notice on the Common Security Agent confirming the same to the Common Security Agent; in which cases the Common Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell and transfer such claim to such purchaser (or an Affiliate of such purchaser) and the consideration for such sale or transfer may be in the form of non-cash consideration by way of the Senior Secured Creditors and/or the Second Lien Creditor (as applicable) bidding by an appropriate mechanic all or part of the Senior Secured Liabilities (such that the Senior Secured Liabilities would, on completion, be discharged to the extent of an amount equal to the amount of the offer made by the relevant Senior Secured Creditors); and (C) such sale or disposal is made: (I) pursuant to a public auction in respect of which the Secured Creditors are entitled to participate; or; (II) where a Financial Adviser selected by the Common Security Agent has delivered an opinion in respect of such sale or disposal that the amount received in connection therewith is fair from a financial point of view, taking into account all relevant circumstances, including the method of enforcement provided that the liability of such Financial Adviser may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement (it being acknowledged that the Common Security Agent shall have no obligation to select or engage any Financial Adviser unless it shall have been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction). For the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, “entitled to participate” shall be interpreted to mean that any offer, or indication of a potential offer, that a holder of any Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities or Senior Subordinated Liabilities makes shall be considered by those running the Public Auction against the same criteria as any offer, or indication of a potential offer, by any other bidder or potential bidder. If, after having applied those same criteria, the offer or indication of a potential offer made by a holder of any Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities or Senior Subordinated Liabilities is not considered by those running the public auction to be sufficient to continue in the public auction process, such consideration being against the same criteria as any offer, or indication of a potential offer, by any other bidder or potential bidder (such continuation may include being invited to review additional information or being invited to have an opportunity to make a subsequent or revised offer, whether in another round of bidding or otherwise), then the right to participate which a holder of any Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities or Senior Subordinated Liabilities under the Intercreditor Agreement shall be deemed to be satisfied. For the purposes of the first and second bullets above and sub-clauses (iv) and (v) and the second paragraph after sub-clause (v)(B) above, the Common Security Agent shall act: - if the relevant Distressed Disposal is being effected by way of enforcement of the Common Collateral, in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “—Manner of Enforcement—Common Collateral” above; and - in any other case, (a) on the instructions of the Instructing Group or (b) in the absence of any such instructions, as the Common Security Agent sees fit. Similar provisions to certain of those set out above in relation to the release of Common Collateral will be included in the Intercreditor Agreement in relation to Other Collateral. The definition of “Other Collateral” will include security granted in favor of certain other creditors required to accede to the Intercreditor Agreement pursuant to requirements set out in the Credit Facilities Agreement relating to certain Permitted Alternative Debt, Acquisition Indebtedness and Affected Acquired Indebtedness (as defined in the Credit Facilities Agreement) and which is secured by assets of the ICA Group.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

For purposes of this Description of the Notes, the €375 million of       % senior notes due 2029 are referred to as the “notes.” The notes will be issued pursuant to a senior notes indenture (the “Indenture”), to be dated as of the Issue Date, among the Issuer, Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”), Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as principal paying agent and transfer agent, Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A., as registrar, and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as the security agent (the “Security Agent”). Copies of the Indenture (and any supplemental indentures) may be obtained from the Issuer upon request after the Issue Date. The notes will be issued in private transactions that are not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and the Indenture will not be qualified under or subject to and will not incorporate (by reference or otherwise) any of the provisions of, the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. Application will be made for the notes to be listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”) and for permission to be granted to deal in the notes on the Official List of the Exchange. There can be no assurance that this application will be accepted. The following summary of certain provisions of the Indenture, the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Charge, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents and the notes does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, all the provisions of the Indenture, the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Charge, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents and the notes, including the definitions of certain terms therein. Capitalized terms used in this “Description of the Notes” section and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Indenture. The Issuer will issue the notes with an initial aggregate principal amount of €375 million. Following the Issue Date, the Issuer may issue additional notes from time to time as described below under “—Additional Notes.” This offering is currently expected to be consummated prior to the consummation of the Acquisition. If this offering does close prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement (the “Escrow Agreement”), to be dated as of the Issue Date, among the Issuer, the Trustee and an escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”), the gross proceeds of the offering of the notes will be deposited into an escrow account (the “Escrow Account”) with the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agreement, including the conditions to the release of the escrowed proceeds, are more fully described below under “—Escrow _of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” In the event the Acquisition has not been consummated on or before October_ 22, 2021 (the “Escrow Longstop Date”), or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the notes will be redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of the notes and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to, but not including, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”). See “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” If a holder has given wire transfer instructions to the Issuer or a Paying Agent, the Paying Agent will deliver payment of all principal, interest and premium, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, on that holder’s notes in accordance with those instructions. All other payments on the notes will be payable, and the notes may be exchanged or transferred, at the office or agency of a Paying Agent as specified in the Indenture unless the paying agent elects to make interest payments by check mailed to the holders at their addresses set forth in the register of holders.

The Guarantees of each Guarantor in respect of the notes will be: - a general senior subordinated obligation of such Guarantor; - secured as set forth under “—Security; Intercreditor Agreement;” - equal in right of payment to all of such Guarantor’s existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Guarantees; - subordinated in right of payment to any of such Guarantor’s existing and future Senior Indebtedness, including its guarantee under the Credit Agreement and certain Hedging Obligations; - effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured Indebtedness and other obligations of such Guarantor that are secured by assets that do not secure its guarantee or that are secured on a first-priority basis over assets that secure the Guarantees on a second-priority basis (including the Indebtedness Incurred under the Credit Agreement and certain Hedging Obligations), to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness or such other obligations, and to any creditor having a preferred claim by operation of law, to the extent of the value of such preferred claim; and - structurally subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of subsidiaries of such Guarantor that do not Guarantee the Notes, including obligations to trade creditors. At March 31, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had €1,550 million of total indebtedness outstanding, including €1,175 million of secured indebtedness outstanding, excluding lease liabilities, nonrecourse factoring transactions, unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs and €275 million of undrawn availability under our revolving credit facility (without giving effect to letters of credit that may be issued under our revolving credit facility). Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the issuance of Disqualified Stock by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries and the issuance of Preferred Stock by the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries, such limitation is subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions. Under certain circumstances, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial amounts of Indebtedness, and such Indebtedness may be secured Indebtedness. The Indenture will not limit the amount of Indebtedness that any direct or indirect parent company of the Issuer may incur or the incurrence of liabilities that do not constitute Indebtedness. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—The substantial indebtedness _of Titan Group could materially adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations and prevent it from fulfilling its obligations under its indebtedness,” “—Certain Covenants—Liens” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.”_ The Guarantees are senior subordinated indebtedness, which means that, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Guarantees rank behind, and are expressly subordinated to, all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantors, including any obligations under the Credit Agreement and any other Indebtedness ranking pari passu with or senior to such Indebtedness incurred after the Issue Date. The ability to take enforcement action against the Guarantors is subject to significant restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement, and potentially any Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date. In addition, the Guarantees and the collateral securing the notes are subject to release under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, the sale of the TLB Borrower or a Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to an enforcement of security over shares of the TLB Borrower or a Restricted Subsidiary taken by the Security Agent acting at the direction of an instructing group of senior secured creditors. See “Description of Certain Financing and Guarantee Arrangements—The _Intercreditor Agreement”. It is therefore likely that holders of Senior Indebtedness and other creditors (including trade creditors)_ of the Guarantors would recover disproportionately more than the holders of the notes recover in any insolvency or similar proceeding relating to such entity. In any such case, there may be insufficient assets, or no assets, remaining to pay the principal of or interest on the notes after the repayment in full of all Senior Indebtedness. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes— _Investors’ right to receive payments on the Notes and Guarantees is contractually and effectively subordinated to certain of Titan Group’s indebtedness and obligations, including borrowings under the Credit Facilities Agreement, possible future borrowings as well as indebtedness and obligations of Titan Group’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes”_",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

Notice of such Special Mandatory Redemption shall be given to the holders of the notes at least five Business Days before the Special Mandatory Redemption Date.

As of the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Guarantors represented approximately 65% of EBITDA of the Target Business, approximately 75% of net sales of the Target Business and approximately 76% of the total assets (excluding goodwill) of the Target Business. Prior to the Completion Date, the Issuer and its Subsidiaries will not control any Guarantor that will be acquired in connection with the Acquisition, and none of such Guarantors will be subject to the covenants described in this Description of the Notes. As such, we cannot assure you that prior to the Completion Date, such Guarantors will not engage in activities that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had those covenants been applicable to such entities after the Issue Date and prior to the Completion Date.

See “Security; the _Collateral.” By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts_ payable with respect to the notes or could even be equal to or reduced to zero.

Notwithstanding the foregoing: (A) the transfer of assets between or among the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall not itself constitute a Change of Control and (B) a Person or group shall not be deemed to have beneficial ownership of securities subject to a stock purchase agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement (or voting or option agreement related thereto) prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by such agreement. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction in which a parent entity of the Issuer becomes a subsidiary of another Person (such Person, the “New Parent”) shall not constitute a Change of Control if (a) the equityholders of the Issuer or such parent entity immediately prior to such transaction beneficially own, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, at least a majority of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of such New Parent immediately following the consummation of such transaction, substantially in proportion to their holdings of the equity of such parent entity prior to such transaction or (b) immediately following the consummation of such transaction, no Person, other than a Permitted Holder, the New Parent or any subsidiary of the New Parent, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, more than 50% of the voting power of the Voting Stock of the Issuer. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, except to the extent that the Issuer has exercised its right to redeem the notes as described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Issuer shall send electronically, mail by first-class mail or otherwise provide in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, a notice (a “Change of Control Offer”) to each holder with a copy to the Trustee describing: (1) that a Change of Control has occurred and that such holder has the right to require the Issuer to purchase such holder’s notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date); (2) the transaction or transactions constitute a Change of Control; (3) the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is sent, except that if a Change of Control Offer is made in advance of a Change of Control and conditioned upon such Change of Control as stated below, the expected repurchase date will be stated and may be based on a date relative to the closing of ----- the transaction that is expected to result in the Change of Control and may be tolled until the closing of such transaction) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); and (4) the instructions determined by the Issuer that a holder must follow in order to have its notes purchased. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (2) notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. A Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, and conditioned upon such Change of Control, with a purchase date to occur upon, or within a specified period of time not to exceed 15 days after, the consummation of such Change of Control. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14(e)-1 of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of such covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this paragraph by virtue of such compliance. Debt agreements to which the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a party may prohibit the Issuer from purchasing any notes as a result of a Change of Control. In the event a Change of Control occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing any notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to permit the purchase of such notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from purchasing the notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture. The Credit Agreement will, and future credit agreements or other debt agreements to which the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary becomes a party may, provide that certain change of control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control under the Indenture). If we experience a change of control that triggers a default under our Credit Agreement or such other Indebtedness, we could seek a waiver of such defaults or seek to refinance our Credit Agreement or any other Indebtedness. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Credit Agreement and such other Indebtedness, such defaults could result in amounts outstanding under our Credit Agreement and such other Indebtedness being declared due and payable. If holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes validly tender and do not withdraw such notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days’ prior notice; provided that such notice is given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price in cash equal to the applicable Change of Control Payment plus, to the extent not included in the Change of Control Payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Our ability to pay cash to the holders of notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our thenexisting financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—The Credit Facilities Agreement, the Notes and other indebtedness provide _that certain change of control events constitute an event of default. In the event of a change of control, Titan Group may not be able to satisfy all of its obligations under the senior secured credit facilities or other indebtedness.”_ The Change of Control purchase feature of the notes may in certain circumstances make it more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers and us. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—The Credit _Facilities Agreement, the Notes and other indebtedness provide that certain change of control events constitute an event of_ ----- _default. In the event of a change of control, Titan Group may not be able to satisfy all of its obligations under the senior secured credit facilities or other indebtedness.”_ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all” under New York law, which governs the Indenture, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control with respect to the notes has occurred and whether a holder of the notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes. If and for so long as the rules of the Exchange require, the Issuer will publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer as required by such rules.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

(ee) Any Indebtedness for joint and several liability in relation to or in connection with a fiscal unity (fiscale eenheid) for Dutch tax purposes; and (ff) any Indebtedness or other obligations in relation to or in connection with a declaration of joint and several liability (hoofdelijke aansprakelijkheid) as referred to in Article 2:403 of the Dutch Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek) in respect ----- of a member of the Group and/or under or pursuant to any residual liability with respect to such declaration arising under Article 2:404 (2) of the Dutch Civil Code or, in each case, its equivalent in any other jurisdiction. For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt or is entitled to be Incurred as Ratio Debt, the Issuer shall, in its sole discretion, at the time of Incurrence, divide and/or classify, or at any later time re-divide and/or reclassify, such item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant. With respect to clauses (d), (k), (r)(ii), (s)(i) and (x) of the second paragraph of this covenant, if at any time the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary would be entitled to have Incurred any then outstanding item of Indebtedness as Ratio Debt, such item of Indebtedness shall be automatically reclassified into an item of Indebtedness Incurred as Ratio Debt. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement outstanding on the Completion Date shall be deemed to have been Incurred pursuant to clause (a)(i) of the second paragraph of this covenant, and the Issuer shall not be permitted to reclassify all or any portion of such Indebtedness. The Issuer will also be entitled to divide an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types permitted in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant without giving pro forma effect to the Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) Incurred on the date of determination pursuant to the second paragraph of this covenant (except to the extent Incurred in reliance of the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Debt Ratio or the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio pursuant to the terms of such other clause) when calculating the amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) that may be Incurred on such date pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant. For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a Debt Facility, reborrowings of amounts previously repaid, shall, at the option of the Issuer, only be deemed for purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent reborrowing thereof. Accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original issue discount or deferred financing costs, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, the payment of dividends on Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock in the form of additional shares of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of the same class, the accretion of liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for purposes of this covenant. For the avoidance of doubt, the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness shall be counted only once and guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit relating to, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included in the determination of such amount of Indebtedness; provided that the Incurrence of the Indebtedness represented by such guarantee or letter of credit, as the case may be, was in compliance with this covenant. For purposes of determining compliance with any Euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than Euros shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower Euro equivalent), in the case of revolving credit debt; provided that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than Euros, and such refinancing would cause the applicable Euro- denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such Euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the outstanding, in the case of term debt, or if greater, committed principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded, with respect to any outstanding Indebtedness, solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, will be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which the respective Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of the refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

The Issuer will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to the Applicable Percentage of Excess Proceeds within ten (10) Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceeds the Excess Proceeds Threshold by mailing or electronically sending or otherwise providing in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. The Issuer may, at its option, satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to an amount equal to or less than the amount of any Net Cash Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer prior to the expiration of the relevant 18 months (or such longer period as provided above) or with respect to Excess Proceeds below the Excess Proceeds Threshold. To the extent that the aggregate amount of notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the amount of Excess Proceeds with respect to which an Asset Sale Offer has been made, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may use such remaining Excess Proceeds (the “Declined Excess Proceeds”) for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of notes or the Pari Passu Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds subject to the Asset Sale Offer, the Issuer shall select or cause to be selected the notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis based on the accreted value or principal amount of the notes or such Indebtedness tendered. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset to zero. The procedures for an Asset Sale Offer will be substantially the same as for a Change of Control Offer. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. Future credit agreements to which the Company becomes a party may limit or prohibit the Company from purchasing any notes as a result of an Asset Sale Offer. In the event the Company is required to make an Asset Sale Offer at a time when the Company is prohibited from purchasing the notes, the Company could seek the consent of its lenders to permit the purchase of the notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Company does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Company will remain prohibited from purchasing the notes. In such case, the Company’s failure to purchase tendered notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture. The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an Asset Sale Offer may be waived or modified with the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. Neither the Issuer, Trustee nor the Initial Purchasers nor their respective agents take any responsibility for these operations and procedures and the Issuer urges investors to contact the systems or their participants directly to discuss these matters. The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream also interface with domestic securities markets in several countries. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear and Clearstream only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

If an individual is a resident of the Netherlands or deemed to be a resident of the Netherlands for Dutch individual income tax purposes, income derived from the Notes and gains realised upon the redemption or disposal of the Notes are taxable at the progressive rates (at up to a maximum rate of 49.50%) under the Dutch Income Tax Act 2001, if: (a) the individual is an entrepreneur (ondernemer) and has an enterprise to which the Notes are attributable or the individual has, other than as a shareholder, a co-entitlement to the net worth of an enterprise (medegerechtigde), to which enterprise the Notes are attributable; or (b) such income or gains qualify as income from miscellaneous activities (resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden), which includes activities with respect to the Notes that exceed regular, active portfolio management (normaal, actief vermogensbeheer).

The individual's yield basis is determined as the fair market value of certain qualifying assets held by the individual less the fair market value of certain qualifying liabilities on January 1. The fair market value of the Notes will be included as an asset in the individual's yield basis.

The Issuer may be a foreign financial institution for these purposes. A number of jurisdictions (including the Netherlands) have entered into, or have agreed ----- in substance to, intergovernmental agreements with the United States to implement FATCA (IGAs), which modify the way in which FATCA applies in their jurisdictions. Under the provisions of IGAs as currently in effect, a foreign financial institution in an IGA jurisdiction would generally not be required to withhold under FATCA or an IGA from payments that it makes. Certain aspects of the application of the FATCA provisions and IGAs to instruments such as the Notes, including whether withholding would ever be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as the Notes, are uncertain and may be subject to change.

For purposes of Dutch tax law, a holder of Notes may include an individual or entity who does not have the legal title of these Notes, but to whom nevertheless the Notes or the income thereof is attributed based on specific statutory provisions or on the basis of such individual or entity having an interest in the Notes or the income thereof. This summary is intended as general information only and each prospective investor should consult a professional tax adviser with respect to the tax consequences of the acquisition, holding, redemption and disposal of the Notes. This summary is based on tax legislation, published case law, treaties, regulations and published policy, in each case as in force as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, and it does not take into account any developments or amendments thereof after that date whether or not such developments or amendments have retroactive effect. This summary does not address the Dutch corporate and individual income tax consequences for: (a) investment institutions (fiscale beleggingsinstellingen); (b) pension funds, exempt investment institutions (vrijgestelde beleggingsinstellingen) or other Dutch tax resident entities that are not subject to or exempt from Dutch corporate income tax; (c) holders of Notes holding a substantial interest (aanmerkelijk belang) or deemed substantial interest (fictief _aanmerkelijk belang) in the Issuer and holders of Notes of whom a certain related person holds a substantial_ interest in the Issuer. Generally speaking, a substantial interest in the Issuer arises if a person, alone or, where such person is an individual, together with his or her partner (statutorily defined term), directly or indirectly, holds or is deemed to hold (i) an interest of 5% or more of the total issued capital of the Issuer or 5% or more of the issued capital of a certain class of shares of the Issuer, (ii) rights to acquire, directly or indirectly, such interest or (iii) certain profit-sharing rights in the Issuer; (d) persons to whom the Notes and the income therefrom are attributed based on the separated private assets (afgezonderd particulier vermogen) provisions of the Dutch Income Tax Act 2001 (Wet inkomstenbelasting _2001);_ (e) entities which are a resident of Aruba, Curaçao or Sint Maarten and that have an enterprise which is carried on through a permanent establishment or a permanent representative on Bonaire, Sint Eustatius or Saba and the Notes are attributable to such permanent establishment or permanent representative; and (f) persons to whom the Notes or the income there from are attributable to (deemed) employment activities, a membership of a management board or a supervisory board or a management role, and which are taxed as employment income in the Netherlands.

If such a position were taken and sustained, the deemed exchange would be taxable to U.S. Holders. In addition, the deemed exchange could cause the amount and timing of a U.S. Holder’s income with respect to the notes to differ from that otherwise described herein.

The term “qualified stated interest” generally means stated interest that is unconditionally payable at least annually at a qualifying rate during the entire term of the Note. Stated interest on the Notes will be treated as qualified stated interest. The amount of income recognized by a cash basis U.S. Holder with respect to a payment of stated interest denominated in euros will be the US Dollar value of the interest payment based on the “spot rate” (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulations) on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into US Dollars. A cash basis U.S. Holder generally will not recognize exchange gain or loss on the interest payment but may recognize exchange gain or loss when it disposes of any euros it receives (as discussed below under “—Disposition of Euros”). An accrual basis U.S. Holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to a payment of stated interest denominated in euros in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, the amount of income accrued will be based on the average spot rate in effect during the interest accrual period or periods (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period within each taxable year). Under the second method, the accrual basis U.S. Holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued on the basis of the spot rate on the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the spot rate on the last day of the portion of the accrual period within each taxable year). Additionally, if the interest payment is actually paid or received within five business days of the last day of the accrual period, an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder may instead translate the accrued interest into US Dollars at the spot rate on the day of actual payment or receipt. Any such election will apply to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. Holder who receives a stated interest payment denominated in euros (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note), may recognize U.S. source exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference between the amount received (translated into US Dollars at the spot rate on the date of receipt) in respect of such accrual period and the US Dollar value of ----- the amount of such stated interest payment previously accrued during such accrual period, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into US Dollars. Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated, for foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to interest income or expense. _Foreign Tax Credit_ Stated interest paid by the Issuer on the Notes (including any amounts withheld and any Additional Amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes imposed on payments on the Notes) and OID (as defined below) will generally be considered income from sources outside the United States and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by or on behalf of a U.S. holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations (including holding period and at risk rules). There are significant complex limitations on a U.S. Holder’s ability to claim foreign tax credits. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors concerning the applicability of the U.S. foreign tax credit and source of income rules to income attributable to the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

In such event, U.S. Holders generally will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) for U.S. federal income tax purposes on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. Holders will include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. The Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds their issue price (as defined above) by an amount equal to or more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount (generally, 0.0025 multiplied by the stated principal amount and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date). U.S. Holders of the Notes with less than the de minimis amount of discount will include the discount on such Notes in income, as capital gain, when principal payments are made on the Note. In the event that the Notes are issued with OID, the amount of OID includible in income by a U.S. Holder is the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in which such U.S. Holder holds such Note (“accrued OID”). A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The “accrual period” of a Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of such accrual period and its yield to maturity, determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of qualified stated interest allocable to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note at the start of any accrual period is equal to its issue price, increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period. For the purposes of determining OID accruals and adjusted issue price only, the amounts of stated interest and OID are determined by assuming that the interest rate on the Notes is a fixed rate based on the value of the floating rate applicable to the Notes as of the issue date. OID, if any, on the Notes will be determined for any accrual period in euros and then translated into US Dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods applicable to accrual basis U.S. Holders described above under “— _Payments of Stated Interest—Euro Denominated Stated Interest.”_ A U.S. Holder will recognize exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the sale of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the US Dollar value of the Euro payment received, determined based on the spot rate on the date such payment is received, and the US Dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. Exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as U.S. source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will generally equal the “US Dollar cost” of the Note to such holder increased by any previously accrued OID and decreased by any cash payments on the Note other than qualified stated interest. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors about how to account for proceeds received on the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of Notes that are not paid in US Dollars Except as discussed below with respect to exchange gain or loss on a Note attributable to currency fluctuations, any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on a taxable disposition of a Note will generally be treated as U.S.-source capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if, at the time of the disposition, the Note was held by the U.S. Holder for more than one year. In the case of an individual U.S. Holder, any long-term capital gain will generally be subject to preferential U.S. federal income tax rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant limitations. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors as to the foreign tax credit implications of the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Notes. The gain or loss that a U.S. Holder realizes on the taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will be taxable as ordinary income or loss and generally will be treated as U.S.-source for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes. Such exchange gain or loss will generally equal the difference, if any, between the US Dollar value of the purchase price of the Note based on the spot rate of exchange on (i) the date of the disposition and (ii) the date on which the U.S. Holder acquired the Note. In addition, upon the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder may realize exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest and accrued OID, if any, which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest” or “—Original Issue _Discount,” as applicable. However, a U.S. Holder will only realize exchange gain or loss upon the disposition of a Note_ (including any exchange gain or loss attributable to the principal amount of a Note and any exchange gain or loss attributable to accrued and unpaid stated interest and accrued OID) to the extent of the total gain or loss realized by such holder on the disposition.

In such case, a U.S. Holder would be required to recognize capital gain or loss in connection with such deemed exchange.

This summary does not address the tax consequences to subsequent purchasers of the Notes. As used herein, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of Notes that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source or (iv) a trust (a) that is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and one or more U.S. persons has the authority to control all of the substantial decisions of the trust or (b) that has made a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations (“Treasury Regulations”) to be treated as a U.S. person.

In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor (the “DOL”) has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the Notes. These exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by an “independent qualified professional asset manager”), PTCE 95-60 (relating to investments by an insurance company general account), PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions directed by an in-house asset manager) and PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts).

Section 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA (together, the “Plan Asset Regulations”), provide that when a Plan acquires an “equity interest” in an entity that is neither a “publicly offered security” nor a security issued by an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act, the Plan’s assets include both the equity interest and an undivided interest in each of the underlying assets of the entity unless it is established either that equity participation in the entity by “benefit plan investors” is not “significant” or that the entity is an “operating company”, in each case as defined in the Plan Asset Regulations. For purposes of the Plan Asset Regulations, equity participation in an entity by benefit plan investors will not be significant if benefit plan investors hold, in the aggregate, less than 25% of the total value of each class of equity interests of such entity, excluding equity interests held by any person (other than a “benefit plan investor”) who has discretionary authority or control with respect to the assets of the entity or who provides investment advice for a fee (direct or indirect) with respect to such assets, and any “affiliates” (as defined in the Plan Asset Regulations) of such person.

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act, or the securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction. The Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will only offer or sell the Notes: (i) in the United States to “qualified institutional buyers” within the meaning of Rule 144A; and (ii) outside the United States in offshore transactions to non-U.S. persons in compliance with Regulation S. Until 40 days after the later of (i) the commencement of this Offering and (ii) the Issue Date, an offer or sale of Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not it is participating in the Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144A. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it: - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) ----- received by it in connection with the issuance or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or any Guarantor; and - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom. No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to the Issuer or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.” The Issuer has also agreed that it will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes. The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. Application will be made for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. We cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market for the Notes as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. We cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price that will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—If an active trading market for the _Notes does not develop, the liquidity and value of the Notes could be harmed.”_ We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be     business days following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+      ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the next       succeeding business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. In connection with the Offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or a person acting on its behalf, may engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the Offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate-covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk Factors— Risks _Related to the Notes—If an active trading market for the Notes does not develop, the liquidity and value of the Notes could be harmed.”_ The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates have provided in the past, and are currently providing, or may in the future provide, various lending, financial advisory, investment banking, corporate finance, commercial banking services and/or other banking services to us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of business, including in connection with the Acquisition. They have received, and expect to receive, customary fees ----- and commissions for these transactions. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates have provided commitments with respect to certain bridge loan facilities in relation to the Acquisition, which are expected to be cancelled following the issuance of the Notes. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates will act as mandated lead arrangers, underwriters and bookrunners, as applicable, under the Term Loan B Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility, which we will enter into as borrowers and draw to provide financing for the Acquisition and to finance or refinance our working capital and general corporate purposes, as applicable. In addition, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch and Barclays Bank PLC and/or their respective affiliates will act as the security agent and facility agent, respectively, under Credit Facilities Agreement. Also, certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates have provided and may continue to provide bank guarantees, letters of credit, working capital facilities, receivables securitizations, factoring or reverse factoring, supplier financing or similar arrangements to the Group. The relevant Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates have received, and expect to receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions, certain of which are payable with proceeds from the issuance of the Notes. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve our securities and/or instruments or those of our affiliates. The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates that have a lending relationship with us may routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions that consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities, including, potentially, the Notes. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

The Recast Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings opened before the end of the “implementation period” under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union which period ended on December 31, 2020. There is therefore no guarantee that, thereafter, UK insolvency proceedings will be respected elsewhere within the European Union. Please see the section headed “The European Union and the United Kingdom” below for more information in this respect. COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time, but is determined for the purposes of deciding which court has competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition: moreover, the determination of where a debtor has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Article 3(1), second sentence, of the Recast Insolvency Regulation states that a company’s COMI “shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which _is ascertainable by third parties.” Under Article 3(1) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation there is, in most cases, a rebuttable_ presumption that a corporate debtor has its centre of main interests in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. The presumption only applies if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Recital 30 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation contains a number of examples of where a presumption as to COMI may be rebutted: for instance, where the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. In that respect, the factors that courts may take into consideration when determining the centre of main interests of a debtor can include where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established and where they recognize as being the centre of the company’s operations. Furthermore, the courts of the member state within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with Article 3 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions. ----- Pursuant to Article 4 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings will be required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation; such decision may be challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428
257_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,214,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,214.1,European Union,214.1.2,Secondary or Territorial Proceedings,"If the centre of main interests of a debtor, at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in a Member State (other than Denmark), only the courts of that Member State have jurisdiction to open the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the Recast Insolvency Regulation and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the Recast Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the Recast Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings may be commenced in another Member State (other than Denmark). If the centre of main interests of a debtor, at the time an insolvency application is made, is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (as defined in Article 2(10) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State. Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the Recast Insolvency Regulation and, for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding-up proceedings. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings that are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to _the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.”_ Accordingly, the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings in another Member State (other than Denmark) will also be possible if the debtor had an establishment in such Member State in the three-month period prior to the request for opening of main insolvency proceedings. The effects of those secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its centre of main interests have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State (other than Denmark) where the debtor has an establishment and either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s centre of main interests is situated under the conditions laid down by that Member State’s law; or (ii) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (a) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (b) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. When main insolvency proceedings are opened, territorial insolvency proceedings usually become secondary insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. Those exceptions include certain ‘safe harbors’ which disapply the _lex fori concursus of the relevant proceedings in respect of certain acts and rights. For example, rights in rem (which include_ the rights of creditors to take enforcement action against, and dispose of, the assets of the company which is subject to the relevant insolvency proceedings) may not be affected by the company’s lex fori concursus and are instead subject to the governing laws which apply to the relevant arrangement under which the creditor obtains such rights. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in the Member State which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (other than Denmark) (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State). These powers are subject to certain limitations (e.g., the powers are available provided that no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State nor any preservation measure to the contrary has been taken there further to a request to commence secondary proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets). However, under Article 36 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings may prevent the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened. For this purpose, the insolvency practitioner must undertake to comply with the distribution and priority rights under the ----- relevant national law from which the local creditors would benefit if the insolvency proceedings were opened in the member state where the assets are located. Such an undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with applicable local laws. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it should, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceeding if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors. Additionally, where a temporary stay of individual enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its creditors, the court seized of a request to open secondary insolvency proceedings may, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors. The court which opened the secondary insolvency proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part on receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods (i.e., up to three months). Where the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that (i) viable enterprises and entrepreneurs that are in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring frameworks that enable them to continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs (i.e. individuals) can benefit from a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby allowing them a second chance and (iii) the effectiveness of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in particular with a view to shortening their length. The EU Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of restructuring, insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards for preventive restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs in order to promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to address financial difficulties at an early stage, when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most notably, the EU Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of individual enforcement actions by creditors against debtors must be introduced by Member States national legislation, (b) all creditor claims shall be grouped into separate classes each of which shall reflect a commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes), (c) creditor claims may be restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number of affected parties in ----- each class and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may, under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. In order to be adopted the plan will have to be confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority that will in particular ensure the protection of each type of creditors’ rights and compliance with the priority rules governing the adoption of the plan. The EU Restructuring Directive must be transposed into national laws or regulations by Member States by July 17, 2021 (with the exception of the provisions relating to the use of electronic means of communication for which the time period for the transposition expires in certain respects on July 17, 2024 or, in others respects, on July 17, 2026), subject to a maximum one year extension of the transposition period for Member States encountering particular difficulties in implementing the EU Restructuring Directive.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

The primary effect of the Exit Regulations is,214.3.1,Inbound Recognition of Insolvency Proceedings Commenced in Overseas Territories,"The position regarding the recognition and coordination of insolvency proceedings in the United Kingdom and the Member States has become more complex since December 31, 2020. As regards the recognition of insolvency proceedings commenced in an overseas territory, the Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (the “CBIR”), which incorporate the provisions of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (the “Model Law”), enable the Courts of the United Kingdom to grant various forms of relief in respect of overseas insolvency proceedings. Such forms of relief include the recognition of an overseas insolvency proceeding in the United Kingdom and the right for the officeholder in such overseas insolvency proceeding to bring claims in respect of antecedent transactions (each of which is discussed in the section headed “England and Wales” below). If recognition is granted, the overseas proceeding will be classed as either foreign main proceedings (which benefit from an automatic stay on certain types of enforcement action by creditors) or foreign non-main proceedings (in respect of which a stay is not automatic, and is instead imposed at the Court’s discretion), depending on whether or not the company’s COMI is situated in the jurisdiction of the relevant proceedings. Consequently, although there is no longer automatic recognition in the United Kingdom of insolvency proceedings commenced in Member States, the CBIR provides a well-established path for the recognition of such proceedings through the Courts of the United Kingdom. In addition to the CBIR, Section 426 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (the “IA86”) enables any Court in the United Kingdom to assist the Courts with corresponding insolvency jurisdiction in any other part of the United Kingdom or any relevant country or territory, and to apply comparable insolvency law applicable by either Court. Such territories include the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, the Republic of Ireland and a number of Commonwealth and former Commonwealth members whose laws are based on common law systems, some of which have similar provisions to assist courts in the United Kingdom. Through this mechanism, insolvency officeholders in the relevant territories are able to request that the Courts of those ----- territories request the assistance of the Courts of the United Kingdom, which may include the recognition of the overseas insolvency proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

The primary effect of the Exit Regulations is,214.3.2,Outbound Recognition of Insolvency Proceedings Commenced in the United Kingdom,"The recognition in Member States of insolvency proceedings which have been commenced in the United Kingdom is less straightforward. Where Member States have enacted laws to incorporate the Model Law into their domestic legislation, recognition can be sought by the use of those laws in a similar way to the recognition of insolvency proceedings by the Courts of the United Kingdom via the CBIR. However, as at the Issue Date, the only Member States to have adopted the Model Law are Poland, Slovenia, Romania and Greece. If insolvency proceedings are commenced in the United Kingdom and the officeholder determines that those proceedings ought to be recognized in a Member State which has not enacted the Model Law (for example, because the company owns valuable assets which are situated in that Member State), an application will be required to the Courts of that Member State for recognition under its domestic laws. The absence of automatic recognition of insolvency proceedings which are commenced in the United Kingdom also means that the Courts of the Member States are no longer bound to adhere to a determination by the Courts of the United Kingdom regarding the location of a company’s COMI. It is therefore now possible for the Courts of the United Kingdom and the Courts of a Member State to adopt differing views regarding a company’s COMI and, as a result, where main insolvency proceedings can be commenced against it. However, whereas the Courts of the other Member States will be bound to follow the determination of the Courts of the relevant Member State regarding the location of the company’s COMI, there is now nothing to bind the Courts of those Member States to a decision given by the Courts of the United Kingdom. The possibility now exists that competing insolvency proceedings could be commenced in the United Kingdom and a Member State with no overarching framework to assist with the coordination and recognition of those proceedings. It is therefore not possible to predict with certainty whether insolvency proceedings commenced against any subsidiary guarantor which is incorporated in the United Kingdom will be recognized by the Courts of any relevant Member State, nor how the Courts of Member States will assist with the coordination of any insolvency proceedings and the preservation and enforcement of creditors’ rights. Applicable insolvency laws may therefore affect the ease and effectiveness of the recovery of claims against any relevant subsidiary guarantor.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

Consequently, a company may still be placed into insolvency proceedings in the United Kingdom if its COMI is in the United Kingdom or if its COMI is in a Member State but the company has an establishment in the United Kingdom. These grounds are however expressed in the Exit Regulations as being supplemental to any other grounds to open insolvency proceedings which apply in the laws of any part of the United Kingdom. Such grounds include the jurisdiction of the Courts of the United Kingdom to wind up any unregistered company (including an overseas company) under the United Kingdom’s insolvency laws provided that the Courts consider that the company has a sufficient connection to the United Kingdom for it to be able to do so, and to place a company in a European Economic Area (“EEA”) state, or having its COMI in an EEA state into certain types of insolvency proceeding in the United Kingdom. The Exit Regulations have however removed large parts of the Recast Insolvency Regulation from English law.

In practice a suspension of payments often results in the bankruptcy of the debtor. All insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). A general description of the principles of those insolvency regimes is set out below.

Once the request for a suspension of payments is filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional suspension of payments and appoint one or more administrators (bewindvoerders). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive suspension of payments. If a draft composition (ontwerpakkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for a suspension of payments, the court can order that the composition will be processed before a decision about a definitive suspension of payments. If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional suspension of payments ends. The definitive suspension of payments will generally be granted unless a qualified minority (i.e. more than one quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one-third of the number of creditors represented at such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured non-preferential creditors declare against it. The granting of a definitive suspension of payments can also be withheld if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a suspension of payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. A suspension of payments takes effect retroactively from 0.00 hours on the day on which the court has granted the provisional suspension of payments. The suspension of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured non-preferential creditors. Under Dutch law secured and preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may enforce their rights against assets of the company in suspension of payments to satisfy their claims as if there were no suspension of payments. A recovery under Dutch law could, therefore, involve a sale of assets that does not reflect the going concern value of the debtor. However, at the request of an interested party or by its own volition the court can order a “cooling down period” (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of two months (which can be extended by the court once for another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred. Also in a definitive suspension of payments, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a simple majority of the number of creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged and admitted in the suspension of payments, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the holders of the Notes to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of Notes in a Dutch suspension of payments proceeding. Interest accruing after the date on which a suspension of payments is granted, cannot be claimed in a composition. Under Dutch law, as soon as a definitive suspension of payments is granted or the composition is ratified by a court, in principle, all pending executions of judgments against the relevant debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor’s assets (other than with respect of secured creditors and certain other creditors, as described above), will be suspended or cancelled by operation of law.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

The WHOA is inspired by the UK Scheme of Arrangements and the US Chapter 11 procedure and it offers debtors additional possibilities to restructure their debt. Unlike a composition in suspension of payments and in bankruptcy proceedings, a composition under the WHOA can be offered to secured creditors as well as shareholders. The WHOA provides, inter alia, for cross class cramdown, the restructuring of group company obligations through aligned proceedings, the termination of onerous contracts, the suspension of certain ipso facto clauses in contracts and supporting court measures. A WHOA composition may result in claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors being compromised if the relevant majority votes in favor of such a composition and it is subsequently confirmed by the Dutch courts. A composition plan under the WHOA can extend to claims against entities that are not incorporated under Dutch law and/or are residing outside the Netherlands. Accordingly, the WHOA can affect the rights of the Trustee and/or the holders of the Notes under the Indenture and therefore the Notes. ----- Voting on a WHOA composition plan is done in classes. A class is deemed to accept the plan if two third of the total amount of the debt of that class or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two thirds of the share capital of that class, participating in the vote, votes in favor. The WHOA provides for the possibility for a composition plan to be binding on a dissenting class (i.e., cross class cramdown). Under the WHOA, the court will confirm a composition plan if at least one class of creditors (other than a class of shareholders) that can be expected to receive a distribution in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor approves the plan, unless there is a statutory ground for refusal. The court can, inter alia, refuse confirmation of a composition plan on the basis of (i) a request by a dissenting creditor, if the value of the distribution that such creditor receives under the plan is lower than the distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or (ii) a request of a dissenting creditor in a dissenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value that deviates from the statutory or contractual ranking and priority to the detriment of that class, unless there is a reasonable ground to do so. There is one mandatory refusal ground specifically applicable to secured financial creditors. If the composition plan entails a debt-for-equity swap to which such creditors do not want to ascribe, and these creditors do not have the right to opt for a different kind of distribution, the court will refuse confirmation of such plan on the request of such creditor. Under the WHOA, the court may grant a stay on enforcement of a maximum of four months, with a possible extension of four months. For the duration of such moratorium, all enforcement action against the assets of (or in the possession of) the debtor is suspended unless with the court’s approval, including action to enforce security over the assets of the debtor or, in case of an undisclosed right of pledge over receivables, the collection, or notification to the debtors. Furthermore, any petitions for bankruptcy in respect of the debtor are suspended and the court may lift attachments on the debtor’s assets at the request of the debtor or restructuring expert.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

Bankruptcy can be requested by a creditor of the debtor or the holder of a security interest over a claim from such creditor, when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the claims (of the creditor requesting bankruptcy or the other creditor) needs to be due and payable. Bankruptcy can also be declared in certain circumstances when a debtor is subject to a suspension of payments. The debtor can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself, provided it has obtained prior approval of its general meeting to file an application for its bankruptcy. The articles of association of the debtor can preclude the necessity of such general meeting approval. Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service (het Openbaar Ministerie) can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings for reasons of public interest (openbaar belang). There is no legal duty for a debtor to file for its own bankruptcy. However, if the managing board of a company realizes that the company is or will be unable to pay its debts when they come due, it is required to take appropriate measures, which could include the cessation of trading, notification of creditors and the filing for either bankruptcy or a suspension of payments (see above). As a result of a bankruptcy, the debtor loses all rights to administer and dispose of its assets. A bankruptcy order takes effect retroactively from 0.00 hours on the day the order is rendered. During a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed to the debtor’s creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims. The general principle of Dutch insolvency law is the paritas creditorum (principle of equal treatment), which means that all creditors have an equal right to payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy proceedings shall be distributed in proportion to the size of their respective claims. However, certain creditors (such as secured creditors and tax and social security authorities) will have special rights that take priority over the rights of other creditors. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could reduce a holder of a Note’s potential recovery in a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding. All unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims, need to be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy for verification, and the receiver in bankruptcy makes a determination as to the existence, ranking and value of the claim and whether and to what extent it should be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings. The valuation of claims that otherwise would not have been payable at the time of the bankruptcy proceeding may be based on a net present value analysis. Interest accruing after the date of the bankruptcy cannot be verified unless secured by a pledge or mortgage, in which case interest will be admitted pro memoria. The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the holders of the Notes may be challenged in a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting (verificatievergadering), the bankruptcy receiver (curator), the insolvent debtor and all verified creditors may dispute the verification of claims of other creditors. Creditors whose claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors’ meeting may be referred to separate court proceedings (renvooiprocedure). These renvooi proceedings could cause holders of the Notes to recover less than the principal amount of their Notes or less than they could recover in other liquidation proceedings. Such renvooi proceedings could also cause payments to the holders of the Notes to be delayed ----- compared with holders of undisputed claims. Creditors of secured claims and preferential creditors with respect to certain assets of a debtor, who expect that the proceeds of a future enforcement against the assets subject to the security or their preferred rights, as the case may be, will be insufficient to satisfy their claim in full, may request to receive the same rights as unsecured and non-preferential creditors with respect to the expected remainder of their claim, with preservation of their rights as a secured or preferential creditor in respect of the secured asset or the asset the relevant preferential right relates to. If a secured creditor enforces its security rights prior to the expiry of the period for submitting claims for verification, and the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to satisfy its claim in full, the remainder of that claim may be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy in order to be verified. Secured creditors may enforce their rights against assets of the debtor to satisfy their claims under a Dutch bankruptcy as if there is no bankruptcy. As in suspension of payments proceedings the supervisory judge (rechtercommissaris) can order a “cooling down period” for a maximum of two months (which can be extended once for another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured creditors are barred unless such creditors have obtained leave for enforcement from the supervisory judge. Furthermore, a bankruptcy receiver can force a secured creditor to foreclose its security interest within a reasonable period of time (as determined by the bankruptcy receiver pursuant to Article 58(1) of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act), failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the relevant rights or assets and distribute the proceeds to the secured party after a deduction of liquidation costs (which may be significant). Excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the bankruptcy estate; they may not be set-off against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor in the bankruptcy. To the extent that Dutch law applies, a legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having a similar effect) can be challenged in an insolvency proceeding or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its trustee in bankruptcy. See below “—Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer.” Under Dutch law, as soon as a debtor is declared bankrupt, in principle, all pending executions of judgments against such debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor’s assets (other than with respect to secured creditors and certain other creditors, as described above), will be terminated by operation of law. Simultaneously with the opening of the bankruptcy, a bankruptcy receiver will be appointed. The proceeds resulting from the liquidation of the bankruptcy estate may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors under the guarantees granted by an insolvent guarantor after the secured and the preferential creditors have been satisfied. In principle, litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed. As in suspension of payments proceedings, in the bankruptcy of a company a composition may be offered to creditors, which shall be binding on unsecured non-preferential creditors if it is (i) approved by a simple majority in number of the creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted, and (ii) subsequently confirmed by the court. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act does not in itself acknowledge the concept of classes of creditors. Remaining proceeds, if any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among the unsecured non-preferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a pro rata basis. Contractual subordination may to a certain extent be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. The actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination is construed.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

The temporary legislation provides for a court ordered moratorium and several related protections which apply until at least August 1, 2021 and can, if and when necessary, be extended beyond that date for two month periods at a time. The measures of the legislation apply to enterprises (other than certain specific regulated entities) whose continuity is threatened due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to a request from creditors (other than the Dutch Tax Authorities) to declare the enterprise bankrupt or initiate the execution or seizure of assets, the enterprise/debtor can request the court to grant a moratorium vis-à-vis those creditors of two months (which may be extended twice at the request of the enterprise/debtor by two month periods at a time), and if such moratorium is granted by the court then during such period: (i) the bankruptcy petition is stayed; (ii) payment obligations to those creditors are suspended, and any prior default does not, in and of itself, provide a legal basis to change the terms or suspend performance of, or terminate, an agreement with those creditors; and ----- (iii) if the court so decides, conservatory and executory attachments by those creditors are suspended, and no other enforcement measures can (continue to) be taken by those creditors against the assets of their debtor without the prior approval of the court. The measures referred to in (iii) can also be requested in summary proceedings and attachments can be terminated as part of such proceedings. It is important to note that any measure of the court only affects those creditors who requested the bankruptcy or initiated the execution or seizure of assets of the debtor. However, any request by other creditors will most likely result in the court taking the same decisions. When considering the request to apply the measures discussed above, the court will need to establish that the enterprise/debtor has made it plausible that, solely or mainly due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the enterprise has not been able to continue its business as usual and as a result has temporarily become unable to pay its debts when they fall due. The enterprise/debtor is in any event presumed to be in this position if it can provide financial information that shows that prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic or the restrictive measures announced since March 15, 2020 (i) it had sufficient liquidity to satisfy its due and payable debts, and (ii) its revenue decreased by at least 20% compared to the average revenue in the preceding three months. The court will further need to conclude that following the moratorium the enterprise/debtor will be able to satisfy its debts and that the creditor(s) that are affected are not significantly and unreasonably prejudiced as a result of the moratorium. When granting a moratorium, the court can take any measures it considers necessary to ensure the interests of the creditor(s) are not prejudiced.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

For that reason, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the ""Parallel Debt"") mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the Holders under or in connection with the Indenture, and a pledge under any Dutch security document will be granted to the Security Agent to secure only the Parallel Debt. The parallel debt concept has not been tested in Dutch courts, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability of a Dutch security document posed by Dutch law. However, the mechanism of Parallel Debt is commonly accepted and applied in Dutch market practice. To the extent that the validity or enforceability of a Dutch security document is successfully challenged, Holders will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of a Dutch security document. In addition, the Holders bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

The articles of association of each Dutch Guarantor permit the provision of guarantee and security. However, the determination of whether a legal act (such as the issuing of a note or the granting of a guarantee or security interest) is within the objects of a company may not be based solely on the description of the articles of association of such company, but must take into account all relevant circumstances, including, in particular, the question of whether the interests of such company are served by the relevant legal act. If the entering into a legal act by a company, in light of the benefits, if any, derived by such company from entering into such legal act, would have an adverse effect on the interest of the company, the legal act may be found to be voidable or the obligation resulting from such legal act unenforceable upon the request of the relevant company or its administrator in bankruptcy. As a result, no assurance can be given that a court would conclude that the issuance of a Note, the granting of the Guarantees or the granting of the security interests over the Collateral is indeed within the corporate object and in the interest of such companies. To the extent that a Dutch Guarantor or the administrator of a Dutch Guarantor successfully invokes the voidability or unenforceability of a Note, a Guarantee or a security interest, such Note, Guarantee or security interest would be limited to the extent any portion of it is not nullified and remains enforceable. If Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security governed by Dutch law may be voided by a court, if the document was executed through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or mistake (dwaling) of a party to the agreement contained in that document. Whether or not a guarantor is insolvent in the Netherlands, pursuant to Dutch law, payment under a guarantee or following enforcement of foreclosure of security granted may, regardless of an ----- insolvency situation occurring or not, be withheld under the doctrines of reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en _billijkheid), force majeure and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden). Other impeding factors include_ dissolution (ontbinding) of contract and set off (verrekening). In addition, a guarantee issued by a Dutch Guarantor and security interest provided by the Issuer or Dutch Guarantor may be suspended (schorsen) by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam (Ondernemingskamer van het _Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) on the mention of a holder or holders of 10% or more of the shares in such company or shares or_ depositary receipts issued therefor with a nominal value of €225,000 or more or such lesser amount as provided in the company’s articles of association. If the company has an issued share capital of at least €22.5 million, such motion may be made by a holder or holders of 1% or more of the shares in such company or, provided those are listed on a qualifying trading venue shares or depositary receipts issued therefor with a value of €20 million or more or such lesser amount as provided in the company’s articles of association. A trade union, and other entities or persons entitled thereto in the articles of association of, or an agreement with, the relevant Dutch company as well as the company itself may also submit a motion to the Enterprise Chamber for this purpose. Likewise, the guarantee or security itself may be upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet actual payment under it may be suspended or avoided. The enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer or a Dutch Guarantor may also be limited under the 1977 Sanction Act (Sanctiewet 1977) or otherwise by international sanctions and in proceedings in a Dutch court for the enforcement of a Dutch law security interest, the court may mitigate amounts due in respect of litigation, enforcement and collection costs.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

In general, mortgages and pledges rank above other rights of priority (other than senior ranking security and other liens), including the general priority right of the Dutch tax authorities on the tax debtor’s assets. However, Dutch law provides for exceptions. For example, under certain circumstances, the Dutch tax authorities’ priority right ranks above a non possessory pledge on inventory (not including stock) found on the premises of the tax debtor (bodemzaken). Schemes often used to interfere with these tax authorities’ priority, most notably the lease of the debtor’s premises (bodemverhuurconstructie), have been restrained by recent legislation. Creditors intending to make use of this scheme, now must inform the tax authority of their intention and may not carry out the scheme during a period of four weeks after the moment the tax authorities have been informed. Enforcement of security rights in a Dutch court is subject to Dutch rules of civil procedure. In addition, foreclosure on security rights created under Dutch law (including allocation of the proceeds) is subject to Dutch law. Under Dutch law, security rights are in principle enforced through a public auction of the relevant assets. This auction has to be effected in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Dutch Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek) and the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure (Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering). Under Dutch law, shares in a Dutch private company with limited liability (besloten _vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) may only be transferred upon foreclosure in accordance with Dutch law and the_ relevant pledged company’s articles of association as they read at the time of foreclosure. Undisclosed rights of pledge on claims can, in principle, only be enforced (through collection of the claims) after the pledge has been disclosed to the debtor. The Security Agent or (unless it has waived such right) the relevant security provider may request the competent court to approve a private sale of the encumbered assets. In the event of pledged assets, the Security Agent and the relevant security provider may agree to an alternative enforcement procedure once the pledge has become enforceable. The Security Agent may also request the competent court to determine that the pledged assets shall accrue to it for a price determined by the court.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

The actio pauliana provisions offer creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside bankruptcy of the relevant person and may be nullified by the bankruptcy receiver in a bankruptcy of the relevant person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person outside bankruptcy, if: (i) the person performed such acts without a prior existing legal obligation to do so (onverplicht); (ii) the creditor(s) concerned or, in the case of the person’s bankruptcy, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the act was performed ----- the person and, unless the act was conducted for no consideration (om niet), the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery. Also to the extent that Dutch insolvency law applies, a guarantee or security interest may be nullified by the bankruptcy receiver on behalf of and for the benefit of all creditors of the insolvent debtor, and in such case the beneficiary of the guarantee or security interest is presumed (subject to evidence to the contrary) to have known that creditors of the debtor would be prejudiced if the bankruptcy follows within a year of the granting and for no consideration. The foregoing requirements for invoking fraudulent transfer outside of a bankruptcy apply mutatis mutandis when invoking fraudulent transfer provisions during a bankruptcy. In addition, the bankruptcy receiver may challenge the guarantee or security interest if it was granted on the basis of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) the guarantee or security interest was granted at a time that the beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed or (ii) if such guarantee or security interest was granted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest with a view to give preference to the beneficiary over the debtor’s other creditors. If a Dutch court found that the issuance of the Notes or the granting of the Guarantees or security interest involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under Dutch law, then the issuance of the Notes or the granting of the Guarantees or security rights could be nullified. Consequently, the validity of the Notes, any guarantees or security interests granted by a Dutch legal entity may be challenged and it is possible that such challenge would be successful. In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the Notes might be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the Dutch Guarantors as a result of the fraudulent conveyance.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

The debtor may propose, in the filing for the commencement of the proceedings, the appointment of a particular person as intermediary. Such proceedings are non-binding since the court-appointed intermediary has no power to force the parties to accept an agreement and the dissenting creditors will not be bound by the arrangement, if any.

Judicial reorganization proceedings are available to companies whose recovery prospects are possible while judicial liquidation proceedings are available to companies whose recovery is manifestly impossible. (c) Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court, after having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may order the commencement of the proceedings which it determines to be most appropriate. The same would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considered that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. As soon as safeguard, judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings are initiated, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. While a company may file for safeguard proceedings at any time it is facing insurmountable difficulties, it is required to petition for the opening of judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings within 45 days of becoming in a state of _cessation des paiements. Alternatively, the debtor may request the opening of conciliation proceedings within the same timeframe. If it does not, directors and, as the case may be, de facto managers of the company, may be subject to civil liability.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, nor invited to attend the hearing before the court at which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested. Following the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is appointed (except for small companies where the court considers that such appointment is not necessary) to investigate the business of the debtor during an “observation period” (being the period starting on the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings and ending on the date on which the court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to 18 months. The role of the court-appointed administrator is also to assist the debtor in preparing a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it will circulate among its creditors. Creditors do not have effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor assisted by the court-appointed administrator. The court-appointed administrator will, in accordance with the terms of the judgment appointing him or her, exercise ex post facto control over decisions made by the debtor (mission de surveillance) or assist the debtor to make all or some of the management decisions (mission d’assistance), all under the supervision of the court. If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation des _paiements) before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public_ prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings. In addition, the court may convert such safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings (i) after commencement of the proceedings, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor, if it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) before commencement of the proceedings, (ii) at any time during the observation period upon its own initiative or upon request of the debtor, the judicial administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor in the case where the debtor is insolvent, or (iii) upon request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor in case no plan has been adopted by the relevant creditors’ committee and, if any, the bondholders’ assembly (as described below), if the approval of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if the company would shortly become insolvent should safeguard proceedings end. At any time during the observation period, the court may also convert such proceedings into liquidation proceedings if the debtor is insolvent and its recovery is manifestly impossible. In all such cases, the court may decide at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor and in all such cases with the exception of (i) above, the court may act upon its own initiative; and the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the public prosecutor, the controllers and the workers’ representatives (if any). ----- Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the state of health emergency that was imposed by the French government, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 and Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020 modified safeguard proceedings to provide that: - As an incentive for new financings granted to debtors in the context of safeguard or reorganization proceedings, a new safeguard or reorganization privilege is created (the “S/R Lien”), applicable exclusively to proceedings commenced between May 22, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The S/R Lien is distinct from the existing statutory preference enjoyed by financing granted with the approval of the bankruptcy judge, after commencement of the proceedings for the needs of the proceedings or of the observation period. - The S/R Lien applies to all new cash contributions made, with the exception of those made through a share capital increase, by any person: (a) during the observation period, in order to ensure the continuity of debtor’s business and its sustainability, in which case such cash contributions must be authorized by the bankruptcy judge, or (b) for the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan, i.e. within the plan as approved or modified by the court, and for the purposes of its execution, it being specified that the judgment must mention all claims benefiting from the privilege, as well as the relevant amounts. - Claims benefiting from the S/R Lien enjoy a priority of payment over pre-commencement and postcommencement claims except with respect to employees’ super-privilege claims, procedural costs and the New Money Lien in the event of on-going or subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings. - Such claims may not be termed-out or written-off without the consent of the relevant creditors. During the safeguard proceedings, payment by the debtor of any debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor, is prohibited, subject to very limited exceptions. For example, the court can authorize payments for prior debts in order to discharge a lien on property needed for the continued operation of the debtor’s business or to recover goods or rights transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire). Creditors must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the safeguard plan (debt write-offs, payment terms or debt-for-equity swaps) prior to the plan being approved by the court. The rules governing consultation will vary depending on the size of the business. Standard consultation: this applies to debtors whose accounts are not certified by a statutory auditor or prepared by a chartered accountant, or, if they are, who have 150 employees or less or a turnover of €20 million or less, unless upon their or the administrator’s request and with the consent of the court, they are subject to the committee-based consultation (see below). In such case, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the court- appointed creditors’ representative, who seeks the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the debt write-offs and payment schedules proposed. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively. French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the creditor and whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at this consultation stage. According to legal commentaries and established practice, differing treatment as between creditors is possible, provided that it is justified by the difference in the situation of the creditors and approved by the court-appointed creditors’ representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for a partial payment of claims over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of such claims over the length of the plan (ten years maximum except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years). Pursuant to Article 5 of Ordinance No. 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 adopted in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, in force from May 21, 2021 and Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020 until December 31, 2021, the maximum length of a plan can be extended to 12 years, or 17 years for agricultural businesses. Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the plan is approved are not required to be consulted. ----- Creditors who do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal (other than debt-forequity-swap) made to them are deemed to have accepted it. The creditors’ representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the court-appointed administrator and the controllers. Pursuant to Article 4 of Ordinance No. 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 adopted in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, in force from May 21, 2021 and Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020, until December 31, 2021, the abovementioned 30-day delay may be reduced to 15 days, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or the courtappointed creditors’ representative. Within the framework of a standard consultation, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de sauvegarde) can impose a uniform rescheduling of the claims of creditors having refused the proposals that were submitted to them (subject to specific regimes such as the one applicable to claims benefiting from the New Money Lien or the S/R Lien) over a maximum period of ten years (except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years and for claims with maturity dates of more than the deferral period set by the court, in which case the maturity date shall remain the same), but no write-off of any claim or debt-for-equity swap may be imposed without the relevant creditor’s individual acceptance. Following a court-imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting the plan or on the first payment date following the initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the first payment date provided for by the plan, in which case the amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had he or she been paid in accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other creditors. In the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 5% of the amount of each debt claim (except for agricultural businesses). Committee-based consultation: this applies to large companies, the accounts of which are certified by a statutory auditor (commissaire aux comptes) or established by a chartered accountant (expert-comptable) and with more than 150 employees or a turnover greater than €20 million, or upon the debtor’s or the administrator’s request and with the consent of the court in the case of debtors that do not exceed the aforementioned thresholds. The consultation involves the submission of a proposed safeguard plan for consideration by two creditors’ committees which are established by the court-appointed administrator on the basis of the claims that arose prior to the judgment commencing the proceedings: - one for credit institutions or assimilated institutions and entities having granted credit or advances (including shareholder advances) in favor of the debtor (or their successors) (the “credit institutions committee”); and - the other one for suppliers having a claim that represents more than 3% of the total amount of the claims of all the debtor’s suppliers and other suppliers invited to participate in such committee by the court-appointed administrator (the “main suppliers committee”). If there are any outstanding debt securities in the form of obligations (such as bonds or notes and including capital market debt instruments such as the Notes), a single general meeting of all holders of such debt securities will be established (the “bondholders’ general meeting”), in which all such holders are to take part irrespective of whether or not there are different issuances or of the governing law(s) of those obligations. As a general matter, only the legal owner of the debt claim will be invited onto the committee or general meeting. Accordingly, a person holding only an economic interest therein will not itself be a member of the committee or general meeting. The proposed plan: - must “take into account” subordination agreements entered into by the creditors before the commencement of the proceedings; - may treat creditors differently if it is justified by their differences in situation; and - may, inter alia, include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts (subject to the specific regime of claims benefiting from the New Money Lien or the S/R Lien), and/or debt-for-equity swaps (debt-for-equity swaps requiring the relevant shareholder consent). ----- If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may subscribe to such share capital increase by way of a set-off against their claims against the debtor (as reduced according to the provisions of the plan, where applicable). Creditors that are members of the credit institutions committee or of the major suppliers committee may also prepare alternative safeguard plans in accordance with the above principles that will also be put to the vote of the committees and of the bondholders’ general meeting, it being specified that approval of any such alternative plan is subject to the same two-thirds majority vote in each committee and in the bondholders’ general meeting and gives rise to a report by the court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire). Bondholders are not permitted to present their own alternative plan. The committees must approve or reject the safeguard plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission. The period may be extended or shortened but may never be shorter than 15 days. The plan must be approved by a majority vote of each committee (two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the creditors casting a vote). Each member of a creditors’ committee or of the bondholders’ general meeting must, if applicable, inform the courtappointed administrator of the existence of any agreement relating to (i) the exercise of its vote or (ii) the full or partial payment of its claim by a third party as well as of any subordination agreement. The court-appointed administrator shall then submit to such person a proposal for the computation of its voting rights in the creditors’ committees/ bondholders’ general meeting. In the event of disagreement, the matter may be ruled upon by the President of the Commercial Court in summary proceedings at the request of the creditor or of the court-appointed administrator. The amounts of claims secured by a trust (fiducie) granted by the debtor do not give rise to voting rights. In addition, creditors whose repayment schedule is not modified by the plan, or for which the plan provides for a payment of their claims in cash in full as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their claims are admitted, do not need to be consulted on the plan nor take part in the vote. Following the approval of the plan by the two creditors’ committees, the plan will be submitted for approval to the bondholders’ general meeting at the same two-thirds majority vote. Following approval by the creditors’ committees and the bondholders’ general meeting, and determination of the rescheduling of the claims of creditors that are not members of the committees or bondholders in accordance with the standard consultation process referred to above, the plan has to be approved (arrêté) by the court. The court must verify that the interests of all creditors are “sufficiently protected” and that required shareholder consent (if applicable) has been obtained. Once so approved by the relevant court, the safeguard plan will be binding on all the members of the committees and all bondholders (including those who did not vote or voted against the adoption of the plan). If the debtor’s proposed plan is not approved by both committees and the bondholders’ general meeting within the first six months of the observation period (either because they do not vote on the plan or because they reject it), this six-month period may be extended by the court at the request of the court-appointed administrator for a period not exceeding the duration of the observation period, in order for the plan to be approved through the committee-based consultation process. Absent such extension, the court can still adopt a safeguard plan within the time remaining until the end of the observation period. In such a case, the rules are the same as the ones applicable for the standard consultation process described above. If the draft plan provides for a modification of the share capital or the by-laws, the court may decide that the shareholders general meeting and, as the case may be, the general meetings of the holders of securities giving access to the share capital of the company shall vote, the first time the relevant meeting is convened, at a simple majority of the votes of the shareholders attending, or represented at, the meeting, provided that they hold at least half of the shares with voting rights. The second time the meeting is convened, the usual provisions relating to quorum and majority shall apply. If the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent. If no proposed safeguard plan whatsoever is adopted by the committees and, if applicable, the bondholders’ general meeting, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the mandataire judiciaire or the public prosecutor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings if it appears that the adoption of a safeguard plan is impossible and if the end of the safeguard proceedings would certainly lead to the debtor shortly becoming insolvent. _Specific case—Creditors that are public institutions: public creditors (financial administrations, social security and_ unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt write-offs under conditions that are similar to those that would be granted under normal market conditions by a private economic operator placed in a similar position. ----- Public creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or relinquish these security interests. Public creditors examine possible debt write-offs within the framework of a local administrative committee (Commission des Chefs de Services Financiers). The tax administrations may grant relief from all direct taxes. As regards indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

However, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 and Law n°2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020 provide that these thresholds will no longer be required for proceedings commenced between May 22, 2020 and December 31, 2021. If the debtor does not meet the conditions that require creditors’ committees (see above) to be constituted, the court shall authorize such constitution in the opening decision. To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfil the following conditions: - the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applies for commencement of conciliation proceedings; - the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the commencement of the proceedings; - as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties which it is not in a position to overcome; and - the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business as a going concern which is supported by enough of its creditors involved in the proceedings to render likely its adoption by the relevant committees (credit institutions’ committee only for financial accelerated safeguard proceedings) and bondholders general meeting, if any, within a maximum of three months following the commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings, or within a month following the commencement of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (that can be extended by an additional month). While accelerated safeguard proceedings apply to all creditors (except employees), accelerated financial safeguard proceedings apply only to “financial creditors” (i.e., creditors that belong to the credit institutions committee and bondholders’ general meeting), the payment of whose debt is suspended until the adoption of a plan through accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. The debtor will be prohibited from paying to any creditor to whom the accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (as the case may be) apply, any amounts (including interest) relating to debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor (post commencement non-privileged debts). Such amounts may be paid only after the judgment of the court approving the safeguard plan and in accordance with its terms. Creditors other than financial creditors (such as public creditors, the tax or social security administration and suppliers) are not directly impacted by accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. Their debts will continue to be due and payable in the ordinary course of business according to their contractual or legal terms. ----- The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings is broadly applicable to accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (for example, creditors will be consulted by way of a committee-based consultation on, as the case may be, a draft accelerated safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde accélérée) or a draft accelerated financial safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde financière accélérée) and creditors that are members of the credit institutions committee or the major suppliers committee, but not bondholders, may also prepare alternative draft plans as described above), to the extent compatible with the accelerated timing, since the maximum duration of accelerated safeguard proceedings is three months and the maximum duration of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is two months (provided the court has decided to extend the initial one month period). However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and to the recovery of assets by their owners do not apply in accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. In particular, the creditors’ committees and the bondholders’ general meeting are required to vote on the proposed safeguard plan within a minimum period of 15 days of its being notified to them in the case of accelerated safeguard proceedings, or within eight days in the case of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. The plan in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is adopted following the same majority rules as in standard safeguard proceedings and may notably provide for rescheduling, debt cancellation and conversion of debt into equity capital of the debtor (debt-for-equity swaps requiring relevant shareholder consent). No debt rescheduling or cancellation may be imposed, without their consent, on creditors that do not belong to one of the committees or are not bondholders. If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the court shall terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors outside of the committee process. Ordinance n°2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 and Law n°2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020 provides that for proceedings commenced between May 22, 2020 and December 31, 2021, if a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline the debtor, the judicial administrator, the creditors representative or the public prosecutor may request, without any delay, that reorganization or liquidation proceedings (as the case may be) be opened. If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the court shall terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors outside of the committee process. The list of claims of creditors party to the conciliation proceedings certified by the statutory auditor shall be deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of accelerated safeguard proceedings or, as applicable, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (see below) unless the creditors otherwise elect to make such a filing (see below).",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

The debtor is required to petition for judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings (or for conciliation proceedings, as discussed above) within 45 days of becoming insolvent; de jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers that would have failed to file such a petition within the deadline are exposed to civil liability. Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court, after having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may order the commencement of the proceedings that it determines to be most appropriate. The same would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considered that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time during the safeguard proceedings observation period, upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the public prosecutor, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings or liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor was already insolvent at the time of the court decision opening the proceedings. In all cases, the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the public prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any). The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the preservation of employment and the payment of creditors, in that order. As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. ----- In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings, an administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up to 18 months, and make proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor (by helping the debtor to elaborate a draft judicial reorganization plan, which is similar to a draft safeguard plan), or the sale of the business or the liquidation of the debtor. The court- appointed administrator will assist the debtor in making management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management and control of the debtor (mission d’administration). Judicial reorganization proceedings broadly take place in a manner that is similar to safeguard proceedings (see above), subject to certain specificities. In particular, the rules relating to creditor consultation, especially the powers of the court adopting the judicial reorganization plan (plan de redressement) in the event of rejection by the creditors of proposals made to them, are the same (see above). At any time during the observation period, the court can, at the request of the debtor, the court- appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the public prosecutor or at its own initiative, order the partial cessation of the business (cessation partielle de l’activité) or order the liquidation of the debtor if its recovery is manifestly impossible. At the end of the observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court. In addition, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 modified the judicial reorganization proceedings to provide for the new S/R Lien (as defined and detailed above see “—France—Court-administered Proceedings—Safeguard”). In judicial reorganization proceedings, in case a shareholders’ meeting needs to vote to bring the shareholders’ equity (capitaux _propres) to a level equal to at least one half of the share capital (capital social) as required by Article L. 626-3 of the French_ Commercial Code, the administrator may appoint a trustee (mandataire de justice) to convene a shareholders’ meeting and to vote on behalf of the shareholders that refuse to vote in favor of such a resolution if the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the reorganization plan. If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly not likely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no reorganization plan is proposed, the court, upon the request of the court-appointed administrator, can order the total or partial transfer of the business in accordance with the process for a sale of the business described below. In judicial reorganization proceedings if (i) the company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within the meaning of the French Labor Code) one or more companies having together at least 150 employees, (ii) the disappearance of the company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy and to local employment and (iii) the modification of the company’s share capital seems to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or regional economy and to allow the continued operation of the business as a going concern, then, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or of the State prosecutor (x) after the review of the options for a total or partial sale of the business and (y) if at least three months have elapsed as from the court decision commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders’ meetings required to approve the modification of the company’s share capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan have refused such modification, the insolvency court may either: - appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders’ meeting and vote the share capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount provided for in the reorganization plan; or - order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan, the sale of all or part of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital modification and holding, directly or indirectly, a portion of the share capital providing them with a majority of the voting rights (including as a result of an agreement with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in the company’s shareholders’ meetings; any consent clause being deemed unwritten, the other shareholders have the right to withdraw from the company and request that their shares be purchased simultaneously by the transferees. In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the parties, be set by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings. In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court which may not exceed the duration of the reorganization plan. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which is generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in judicial liquidation proceedings nor does the law limit their duration (except with respect to simplified judicial liquidation proceedings). The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and perform the liquidation operations (mainly to liquidate the assets and settle the ----- liabilities to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority order of payment). The liquidator will take over the management and control of the debtor and the managers of the debtor are no longer in charge of its management. Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes: - a sale of business (cession d’entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) will usually be appointed to manage the debtor during a temporary period of continuation of the business operations ordered by the court (three months, renewable once) and organize such sale of the business as a going concern via an asset sale, i.e. an asset sale plan (plan de cession), any third party (as construed under French law) being entitled to present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business); or - a sale of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to: - launch auction sales (vente aux enchères (or adjudication amiable for real estate assets only)); - sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers have been received (the formal authorization of the bankruptcy judge being necessary to conclude the sale agreement with the bidder); or - in practice, request, under the supervision of the bankruptcy judge, all potential interested purchasers to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process whereby the bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed before such hearing (procédure des plis cachetés). However, the possibility to implement such process is questioned by certain legal authors and case law in this respect has varied. If the court adopts a reorganization or sale plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent. The court will end the proceedings when either no due liabilities remain and the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif) or continuation of the liquidation process becomes impossible due to an insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif). The court may also terminate the proceedings: - when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the difficulty of selling the assets; or - in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors, by appointing a mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from these lawsuits between the remaining creditors.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

During the observation period, the court-appointed administrator investigates the business of the company. Under safeguard proceedings, the court-appointed administrator’s mission is limited to either supervising the debtor’s management or assisting it, and in any case helping it prepare a safeguard plan for the company. In judicial reorganization proceedings, the court-appointed administrator’s mission is usually to assist the management and to make proposals for the reorganization of the company, which proposals may include a reorganization or an asset sale plan. In judicial reorganization proceedings, the court may also decide that the court-appointed administrator will manage the company alone by replacing the debtor’s management. ----- At the end of the observation period, if it concludes that the company can survive as a going concern, the court will adopt a safeguard or a reorganization plan, which will essentially provide for a restructuring and/or rescheduling of debts which may only entail the partial divesture of assets rather than the entire business, to a third party (a sale of the entire business is not possible under safeguard proceedings). At the end of the observation period of judicial reorganization proceedings and, alternatively to a reorganization plan, the court may determine that all or part of the business should be sold to purchasers who have submitted bids. In such a case, the court orders such a (partial or entire) sale in the framework of a so-called “asset sale plan” (plan de cession), which consists of transferring assets, contracts and employees cherry-picked by the purchaser thereto, for a lump sum, in accordance with the bid submitted by the purchaser during the observation period. Judicial liquidation proceedings entail the relief of the debtor of the management and there is no observation period in such proceedings. The outcome of liquidation proceedings, which is decided by the court without a vote of the creditors, may be a sale of the business and/or isolated sales of the debtor’s assets in order to discharge the debtor’s liabilities. Where a sale of the business (partial or not) is contemplated, the court may authorize a temporary continuation of the business for a maximum period of three months (renewable once for a period of three months at the public prosecutor’s request) whose effects are similar to an observation period. If the court adopts a safeguard plan, a reorganization plan or an asset sale plan, it can set a time period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continued business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent. The sales that have been pre-packed in mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings and that are deemed satisfactory will be implemented in the framework of subsequent court-administered proceedings through an expeditious and derogatory process. Such sale could only relate to part (but not all) of the business of the debtor in safeguard proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

Also, except in the case of fraud, the insolvency date may not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings (see above). The insolvency date is important because it marks the beginning of the “hardening period ” (période suspecte), being the period from the insolvency date of the debtor to the court decision commencing the judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings affecting it. Certain transactions entered into by the debtor during the hardening period are automatically void or voidable by the court. Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors. These include transfers of assets for no consideration or for a nominal consideration, contracts under which the reciprocal obligations of the debtor significantly exceed those of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments of the debts that are due made in a manner which is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business, deposits of cash or monetary instruments ordered by a court decision that has not yet become final to serve as bond or as a precautionary measure in accordance with Article 2350 of the French Civil Code, security granted for debts previously incurred, provisional attachment or seizure measures (mesures conservatoires) (unless the attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to stock options, the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as security for a debt simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that affects assets or rights already transferred in the trust as security for debt incurred prior to such amendment, and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code. Voidable transactions include, transactions for consideration, payments made on debts that are due, an notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions, in each case, if such actions are taken after the debtor was in cessation des paiements and the court determines that the party dealing with the debtor knew that the debtor was insolvent at the relevant time. In addition, transactions relating to transfers of assets for no consideration and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code are also voidable when entered into during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the hardening period. There is no hardening period prior to the opening of safeguard proceedings, since the condition required to commence such proceedings is that the company is not insolvent within the meaning of French law. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

Nor are “contractual provisions modifying the conditions of continuation of an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings” (in accordance with a decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de Cassation) dated January 14, 2014, n° 12-22.909, which case law is likely to be extended to safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings). However, the court- appointed administrator can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) that it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. Conversely, the court-appointed administrator can require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even though the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its postcommencement contractual obligations (and provided that, in the case of judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on delivery). The commencement of liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of an asset sale plan (plan de cession) as described above; in such case, the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision adopting the asset sale plan (plan _de cession), as described above, or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends._ During the observation period: - accrual of interest is suspended (except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of contracts providing for a payment which is deferred by at least one year (however, accrued interest can no longer be compounded); - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings, subject to specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set-off of related (connexes) debts and payments authorized by the insolvency judge (juge-commissaire) to recover assets required by the continued operation of the business and post-petition debts, unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor; - debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and which were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a “New Money Lien”), provided that they are duly brought to the attention of the court-appointed administrator or, failing one, the mandataire judiciaire or, should they both have ceased to be in office, the plan commissioner or the judicial liquidator within one year of the end of the observation period; - in the context of judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to other terms of payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrat en cours), will be required; and - creditors (only financial creditors in the case of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings) may not initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or against a guarantor of the debtor where such guarantor is a natural person and the proceedings are safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings) with respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings if the objective of such legal action is: ----- `o` to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor may require that a court determine the amount due) in order to file a proof of claim, as described below) `o` to terminate a contract for non-payment of amounts owed to the creditor; or `o` to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor, except (i) in judicial liquidation proceedings, by way of the applicable specific process for judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) where such asset—whether tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable, is located in another Member State within the European Union, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency proceedings, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation. A natural person that is the guarantor of the debtor may avail itself of the provisions of a safeguard plan adopted by the court but not the provisions of a judicial reorganization plan. In accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the above rules only apply to the creditors that fall within the scope of those proceedings. Debts owed to other creditors, such as suppliers, continue to be payable in the ordinary course of business. As a general rule, creditors domiciled in France whose debts arose prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings must file a proof of claim (declaration de cr´ _eances´_ ) with the creditors’ representative within two months of the publication of the court decision in the Bulletin Officiel des annonces civiles et commerciales (by exception, the deadline starts upon receipt of an individual notification for those creditors whose claim arose out of a published contract or who benefit from a published security interest); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside France. Where the debtor has informed the creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim and no proof of a claim has been filed yet, such claim is deemed filed with the creditors’ representative. Creditors are allowed to confirm a proof of claim made on their behalf. Creditors who have not submitted their claims during the relevant period, whose claims are not deemed filed with the creditors’ representative save for a ratification by the creditor of a proof of claim made on its behalf, are barred, except with respect to very limited exceptions, from receiving distributions made in accordance with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limitations and are preferential creditors under French law. Under accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the claims held by creditors that took part in the conciliation proceedings are listed by the debtor and certified by its statutory auditor (or, in its absence, its accountant) and are thus deemed to have been filed. Although such creditors can file proofs of claim pursuant to the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust the amounts of their claims as set forth on the list prepared by the debtor (within the 2 or 4 month time limit). Those creditors who did not take part in the conciliation proceedings (but who would be members of the creditors’ committees or the bondholders’ general meeting) would have to file their proofs of claim within the above-mentioned deadlines. If the court adopts a safeguard plan, an accelerated safeguard plan, an accelerated financial safeguard plan or a reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan. If the court adopts an asset sale plan (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings (see above), the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment of the creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator in charge of selling the assets of the company and settling the relevant debts in accordance with their ranking. French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employee claims, postcommencement legal costs (essentially, court-officials fees), creditors who, benefit from a New Money Lien or a S/R Lien (see above), post-commencement privileged creditors and the French State (taxes and social charges). In the event of judicial liquidation proceedings only, certain pre-commencement secured creditors whose claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to post-commencement privileged creditors. This order of priority does not apply to all creditors, for example it does not apply to creditors benefiting from a retention right over certain assets with respect to their claim related to such asset.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

In addition, any security or guarantees taken to support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable on any of these grounds can be cancelled or reduced by the court. Case law has recently set out that this liability would also require that the granting of the facility be deemed to be wrongful. If a creditor has repeatedly interfered in the company’s management, it can be deemed a de facto manager of such company (“dirigeant de fait”). In such case, Article L.651-2 of the French Commercial Code provides that, if liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire) have been commenced against the debtor, the creditor may be liable for bearing the excess of liabilities over the company’s assets, along with the other managers (whether de jure or de facto), as the case may be, if it is established that their mismanagement has contributed to the company’s shortfall of assets. If such conditions are met, French courts will decide whether the managers should bear all or part of the shortfall amount. However, a manager (whether de jure or de facto) cannot be held liable on the basis of Article L. 651-2 of the French Commercial Code in cases of “simple negligence” (simple négligence) in the management of the company.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition. French law requires that, when a French company grants a guarantee on third-party obligations, the guarantee must be in the corporate purposes and in the corporate interests of the guarantor company. Under French corporate benefit rules, a guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee, taken as a whole. A court could declare any guarantee unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if it found that these criteria were not fulfilled. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance. Accordingly, the Guarantee granted by any French Guarantor and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited, at any time, to an amount equal to the aggregate of the proceeds of the Notes to the extent directly or indirectly on-lent by the Issuer to that French Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries or used to refinance any indebtedness previously directly or indirectly on-lent to that French Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries, in each case under intercompany loans or similar arrangements, and outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such French Guarantor under its Guarantee. Any payment made by such French Guarantor under its Guarantee in respect of the obligations of any other obligor shall reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount of the intercompany loans or similar arrangements due by such French Guarantor or its subsidiaries under the intercompany loan or similar arrangements referred to above. By virtue of this limitation, the amount of the French Guarantor’s obligations as Guarantor under the Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, and the French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation as Guarantor under the Guarantee should the portion of the proceeds of the Notes made available to such French Guarantor directly or indirectly be equal to zero. In addition, if any French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic return that is less than the economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on an arm’s length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable arm’s length transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances. The limitation language for the obligations of the French Guarantors to be incorporated into the relevant Notes documents and in particular in the Indenture, will substantially be in the form as follows: (a) “The obligations and liabilities of the French Guarantors under the Notes and in particular under the guarantee clause of the Indenture shall not include any obligation or liability which, if incurred, would constitute the ----- provision of financial assistance within the meaning of Article L. 225-216 of the French Code de Commerce and/or would constitute a misuse of corporate assets within the meaning of Articles L. 244-1, L. 242-6 or L. 241-3 of the French Commercial Code or any other law or regulation having the same effect, as interpreted by French courts. (b) The obligations and liabilities of any French Guarantor under the guarantee clause of the Indenture for the obligations under the Notes of any other Obligor which is not a Subsidiary of such French Guarantor shall be limited, at any time to an amount equal to the aggregate of all amounts directly or indirectly borrowed under the Notes by such other Obligor to the extent directly or indirectly on-lent to such French Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries or used to refinance any indebtedness previously directly or indirectly on-lent to that French Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries, in each case under intercompany loan or similar arrangements, and outstanding at the date a payment is to be made by such French Guarantor under the guarantee clause of the Indenture; it being specified that any payment made by the French Guarantor under the guarantee clause of the Indenture in respect of the obligations of such Obligor shall reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount of the intercompany loans or similar arrangements due by such French Guarantor under the intercompany loan or similar agreements referred to above and that any repayment of the intercompany loans or similar arrangements by the French Guarantor shall reduce pro tanto the amount payable under the guarantee clause of the Indenture. (c) The obligations and liabilities of any French Guarantor under the guarantee clause of the Indenture for the obligations under the Notes of any other Obligor which is its Subsidiary shall not be limited and shall therefore cover all amounts due by such Obligor as Issuer and/or as Guarantor.

Each of these insolvency proceedings will be legally independent from all other insolvency proceedings (if any) within a group of companies. In particular, there is no consolidation of assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency and no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group. On April 12, 2018, the act to facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung der Bewältigung von Konzerninsolvenzen) came into force. However, this act mainly provides for coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies. The act does not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims amongst the respective entities of a group, but rather stipulates four key amendments of the German Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may be competent for each group entity insolvency proceedings; (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all group companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings” (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordination insolvency administrator” (Koordinationsverwalter) with the ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan). Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex officio, but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag). Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or if the debtor is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due (Zahlungsunfähigkeit). According to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business as a going concern in the ----- next 12 months is predominantly likely (positive Fortführungsprognose). As a guideline, the debtor is deemed illiquid if it is unable to pay its debts when they fall due, i.e. the debtor is unable to pay 10% or more of its due and payable liabilities during the subsequent three weeks, unless it is virtually certain that the company can close the liquidity gap shortly thereafter (demnächst) and it can be deemed acceptable to the creditor to continue to wait for the payments owed by such debtor. If a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft - AG), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea - SE) or a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung - GmbH) or any company not having an individual as personally liable shareholder becomes illiquid and/or over-indebted, the management of such company and, under certain circumstances, its shareholders are obliged to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay, however, at the latest within three weeks after the occurrence of illiquidity and six weeks after the occurrence of over-indebtedness. Noncompliance with these obligations exposes management to both severe damage claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) is a valid insolvency reason under German law which exists if the company is currently able to service its payments obligations, but will presumably not be able to continue to do so at some point in time within a certain prognosis period. As a rule, a forecast period of 24 months is to be taken as a basis. A debtor is therefore imminently illiquid (but not yet over-indebted), if he will likely be able to satisfy its liabilities in the next 12, but not in the next 24 months. However, only the debtor, but not the creditors, is entitled (but not obliged) to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in the event of an imminent illiquidity of the debtor. On March 27, 2020, the German Act on the temporary suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency and on the limitation of managing directors’ liability in case of insolvency caused by the COVID 19 pandemic (COVID-19_Insolvenzaussetzungsgesetz – “COVInsAG”) entered into force with retroactive effect as of March 1, 2020. By a law of September 25, 2020 (and with effect as of October 1, 2020), the COVInsAG has been partially extended. According to this version of the COVInsAG, the obligation to file for insolvency due to over-indebtedness was suspended until December 31, 2020. However, this did not apply to companies whose over-indebtedness was not resulting from the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. By amendment of the COVInsAG with effect of February 1, 2021 the obligation to file an insolvency petition under the aforementioned conditions is suspended until, currently, April 30, 2021 if (i) the debtor has filed for an application for financial assistance under governmental assistance programs to mitigate the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic in the period from November 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021 or (ii) the debtor falls within the group of beneficiaries of these governmental assistance programs, but it was not possible to submit an application for factual or legal reasons. The COVInsAG also provides for a certain relief from claw-back provisions, if the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of filing duties, inter alia for the satisfaction of claims or the provision of collateral for these claims, which the creditor was entitled to receive and unless the creditor knew that the restructuring and refinancing efforts of the debtor were not suitable to eliminate an existing illiquidity of the debtor in the meaning of section 17 of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) (see also below). Furthermore, for an interim period until December 31, 2021, the COVInsAG reduces the forecast period (Fortführungsprognose) relevant for determining whether a continuation of the debtor’s business is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) for the purposes of the assessment of the insolvency ground of overindebtedness from twelve months to four months provided that the debtor’s over-indebtedness is caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic, which is assumed if (i) the debtor was not illiquid as of December 31, 2019, (ii) the debtor’s result from its ordinary business activity was positive in the last financial year prior to January 1, 2020, and (iii) the revenue from the debtors’ ordinary business activity in calendar year 2020 was more than 30% lower than the revenue in calendar year 2019. The insolvency proceedings are controlled by the competent insolvency court which monitors the due performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary measures (vorläufige _Maßnahmen) to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings (vorläufiges Insolvenzverfahren). The_ insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s moveable assets during these preliminary proceedings. In addition, the court will generally also appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter), unless the debtor has petitioned for debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) - an insolvency proceeding in which the debtor’s management generally remains in charge of administering the debtor’s business affairs under the supervision of a custodian (Sachwalter). The order for opening an insolvency proceeding as debtor-inpossession proceeding requires that (i) it has been requested by the debtor with a detailed and coherent debtor-in-possession planning (Eigenverwaltungsplanung) and (ii) no circumstances are known which indicate that the self-administration plan is based on inaccurate facts in material respects. In case of self-administration, the court shall refrain from (i) imposing on the debtor a general prohibition on making dispositions or (ii) ordering that all of the debtor’s dispositions are effective only with the consent of a preliminary insolvency administrator. In this case, instead of a preliminary insolvency administrator, a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter) shall be appointed who shall supervise the management of the debtor in the preliminary insolvency proceeding (vorläufige Eigenverwaltung). If the debtor has filed a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings based on an insolvency reason other than illiquidity (i.e., imminent illiquidity or over-indebtedness), combined with a petition to initiate such process based on a debtorin-possession status and can prove (by way of a certification provided by a tax advisor, accountant or lawyer with experience ----- in insolvency matters or a person with comparable qualifications) that there is no illiquidity and a restructuring of its business is not obviously futile (offensichtlich aussichtslos), the court shall, upon the request of the debtor, set a deadline of up to three months for submission of an insolvency plan, so-called “protective shield” (Schutzschirm). In addition, for an interim period until December 31, 2021, debtors have access to the protective shield proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren) even in the state of illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) provided that the debtor’s illiquidity was caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This is assumed if (i) the debtor was not illiquid as of December 31, 2019, (ii) the debtor’s result from its ordinary business activity was positive in the last financial year prior to January 1, 2020, and (iii) the revenue from the debtors’ ordinary business activity in calendar year 2020 was more than 30% lower than the revenue in calendar year 2019. During this period, the creditors’ rights to enforce security may - upon application of the filing debtor - be suspended. Under these circumstances, the insolvency court has to appoint a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter) to supervise the process. The debtor is entitled to suggest an individual to be appointed as custodian with such suggestion being binding on the insolvency court unless the suggested person is obviously not eligible to become a custodian (i.e., is obviously not competent or impartial). Depending on the size of the debtor’s business operations and several other circumstances, the insolvency court must or may appoint a preliminary creditors’ committee (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss). The preliminary creditors’ committee will be asked for their view on a petition for debtor-in-possession status, or on the profile of the (preliminary) insolvency administrator to be appointed or to suggest a particular individual to be appointed by the court. In case the members of the preliminary creditors’ committee unanimously agree on an individual, such suggestion is binding on the court (unless the suggested individual is not eligible; i.e., not competent and/or not impartial). To ensure that the preliminary creditors’ committee reflects the interests of all creditor constituencies, it shall comprise a representative of the secured creditors, one for the large creditors and one for the small creditors as well as one for the employees. The duties of the preliminary insolvency administrator are, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the debtor’s assets (which, depending on the circumstances, includes the continuation of the business carried out by the debtor), to verify the existence of an insolvency reason and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings. The court orders the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens) if certain requirements are met, in particular if there are sufficient assets (Insolvenzmasse) to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties (e.g., creditors) advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings will be dismissed for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse). Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) (usually, but not necessarily, the same person who acted as preliminary insolvency administrator) is appointed by the insolvency court unless a debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered. In case the court orders for a debtor-in-possession status, the debtor’s management generally remains in charge of administering the debtor’s business affairs under the supervision of a custodian (Sachwalter). In the absence of a debtor-in-possession status, the right to administer the debtor’s business affairs and to dispose of the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator with the insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) only being entitled to request the change of the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by head count and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual becoming the new insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual be eligible as officeholder (i.e., sufficiently qualified, business-experienced and impartial). The insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s business. These new liabilities incurred by the insolvency administrator qualify as preferential claims against the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) which are preferred to any insolvency claim of an unsecured creditor (with the residual claim of a secured insolvency creditor remaining after realization of the available collateral (if any) also qualifying as unsecured insolvency claim). From the perspective of the holders of the Notes, among others, some important consequences of such opening of formal insolvency proceedings against any German Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries that are subject to the German insolvency regime would be the following: - the right to administer and dispose of the assets of the insolvent entity would generally pass to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate, unless the court orders debtorin-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung); - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) with respect to such insolvent entity, disposals effected by the management of such insolvent entity, after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, are null and void by operation of law; ----- - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter, a creditor in the insolvency proceedings has acquired through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of such insolvent entity’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings; - claims against such insolvent entity may only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and - any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderungsrecht) (i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not constitute part of the insolvency estate) does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator. Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses” entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not to perform the contract (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters) unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law. This will likely also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law. Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrators opt for performance. All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)), wishing to assert claims against the insolvent debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however, secured creditors have certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal nature of the security interest entitlement to enforce such security is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. In this context, it should be noted that the insolvency administrator generally has the sole right to realize any moveable assets in his/the debtor’s possession which are subject to preferential rights (e.g., liens over movable assets (Mobiliarsicherungsrechte) or security transfer of title (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). In the case of creditors secured by pledges over shares or company interests forming part of the insolvency estate it is, in the absence of authoritative case law, uncertain whether the creditors are entitled to initiate the enforcement process in respect of the pledged shares on their own or whether the insolvency administrator has the right to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of the secured creditors. In case the enforcement right is vested with the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds plus VAT (if any), are disbursed to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. With the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor the insolvency administrator has to satisfy the creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger) first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as well as any preferred liabilities incurred by the insolvency estate after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings). Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims— _Insolvenzforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there_ is value remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) after the security interest and the preferential claims against the estate have been settled and paid in full. The preferential right (Absonderungsrecht) of a creditor may not necessarily prevent the insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator must, however, compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting from such use. Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be subordinated by law, while claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings (Massegläubiger) generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. Claims of subordinated ----- creditors in the insolvency proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the claims of other nonsubordinated creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied. The unencumbered assets of the debtor serve to satisfy the costs of the insolvency proceeding (Kosten des _Insolvenzverfahrens) first and afterwards the preferred creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger). Typically, liabilities_ resulting from acts of the insolvency administrator after commencement of formal insolvency proceedings constitute liabilities of the insolvency estate. Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims (Insolvenzforderungen)), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is value remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). It may take several years before an insolvency dividend (if any) is distributed to unsecured creditors. In insolvency proceedings over the assets of a German Guarantor, the claims of the holders of the Notes against such German Guarantor under the Guarantees would only rank as unsecured insolvency claim. German insolvency law also provides for certain creditors to be subordinated by law. The following subordinated claims shall be satisfied ranking below the other unsubordinated claims of insolvency creditors in the order given herein, and in proportion to their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency creditors from the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offense binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims on the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration; (v) claims for the restitution of shareholder loans (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms to such a loan; and (vi) claims which the creditor and the debtor agreed to be subordinated in insolvency proceedings. The COVInsAG, however, suspends the statutory subordination of shareholder loans and receivables from economically similar acts in insolvency proceedings applied for up until September 30, 2023 for newly granted shareholder loans that were granted between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2021 and where the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of the filing duties at the time. Under certain circumstances, restrictive covenants and undertakings in finance documents may result in the relevant creditor being considered to hold a “shareholder-like position” (gesellschafterähnliche Stellung) in the insolvent entity. In that event, in an insolvency proceeding over the assets of such insolvent entity, the claims against that entity would be treated as a subordinated insolvency claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen) in accordance with the rules applying to shareholder loans. A third party acquiring the claims that are subject to the rules of the treatment of shareholder loans will itself be exposed inter alia to a claw back risk with respect to repayments that have been made within the period of one year prior to the request to open insolvency proceedings or subsequent to such request (section 135 of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung)). Subordinated insolvency claims are not eligible to participate in the insolvency proceedings over the assets of the debtor (or in any transaction security) unless the insolvency court handling the case has granted special permission allowing these subordinated insolvency claims to be filed which is not granted in the majority of insolvency cases governed by German law. To the extent any creditor that benefited from the transaction security was a subordinated creditor, potential sharing and equalization provisions in the finance documents could result in holders who are not subordinated suffering a shortfall on the amount they recover. While in ordinary insolvency proceedings aiming at the liquidation of the relevant insolvent debtor, the value of the insolvent entity’s assets may be realized by a piecemeal sale or, as the case may be, by a bulk sale of the entity’s business as a going concern, a different approach aiming at the restructuring and preservation of such entities can be taken based on an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan). The insolvency plan may – to some extent – deviate from the provisions of the German Insolvency Code for regular insolvency proceedings and may, for example, also include (and restrict) under certain circumstances the security rights of the creditor vis-à-vis other group companies not being insolvent (gruppeninterne _Drittsicherheiten). Such plan can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires, among other things_ and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules and the approval of the insolvency court (while a group of dissenting creditors or the debtor can - under certain circumstances - be crammed down). The insolvent entity itself may only oppose the proposed plan if the plan is detrimental to the insolvent company (in comparison to an ordinary insolvency proceeding) or if any creditor will receive a higher economic value than the amount of its claim. If the debtor is a corporate entity, also the shares or, as the case may be, the membership rights in the debtor can be included in the insolvency plan (e.g., they can be transferred to third parties, including a transfer to creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap). In this case, the adoption of the insolvency plan generally also requires the consent of the group of the shareholders. However, the group of dissenting shareholders can - under certain circumstances - also be crammed down. Under the German Insolvency Code, the insolvency administrator (or in case of debtor-in-possession proceedings, the custodian) may void (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the commencement of formal insolvency proceedings during applicable voidable periods. Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are successfully voided by the insolvency administrator, any amounts or ----- other benefits derived from such challenged transaction, performance or act will have to be returned to the insolvency estate plus accrued interest. The administrator’s (or custodian's) right to void transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions having occurred up to ten years prior to the filing for the commencement of insolvency proceedings. In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to any insolvent entity based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the holders for or providing credit support for the benefit of the notes could be subject to potential challenges (i.e., clawback rights) by an insolvency administrator under the rules of avoidance as set out in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). In the event such a transaction is successfully voided (angefochten), the holders of the notes may not be able to recover or retain any amounts under the notes and may participate in the insolvency proceedings as unsecured creditor only. If payments have already been made under the notes,any amounts received from a transaction that had been voided would have to be repaid (plus accrued interest) to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). In this case, the holders of the notes may only have a general unsecured claim under the notes without preference in insolvency proceedings. In particular, a legal act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the creditors of the debtor may be voided according to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in the following cases: - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, provided that the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of circumstances that clearly suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances that clearly suggest such illiquidity or filing); - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled, or which was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (i) such act was taken during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time or (iii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that clearly suggest such detrimental effect); - a legal transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, if it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at such time or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction knew either of the debtor’s illiquidity or of such filing at the time of the transaction; - any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security or as paid for a third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings; - any act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the intention of prejudicing its insolvency creditors (vorsätzliche Gläubigerbenachteiligung) and the beneficiary of the act knew of such intention at the time of such act. Such intention of the debtor and the respective knowledge of the beneficiary shall be presumed if the debtor and the beneficiary knew of the debtor’s imminent insolvency, and that the transaction constituted a disadvantage for the creditors; in the case that the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt, the avoidability of acts is limited to four years. In the case that the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt to which such creditor was entitled in that form and that time, knowledge of such creditor of the intention of the debtor to prejudice its insolvency creditors shall (only) be presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was actually illiquid (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors. The fact that the ----- creditor agreed on a payment plan with the debtor, or agreed to deferred payments, shall establish the presumption that he had no knowledge of the debtor being illiquid at this time; - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party that directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be voided unless such contract was concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time the contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term “affiliated party” includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management board or supervisory board, general partners and shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons who are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons; - any act that provides security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a claim of a shareholder for repayment of a shareholder loan or a similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security, the act took place during the last ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of the insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition; or - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third party if (i) the satisfaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor (Garant) or provider of surety (Bürge) (in which case not the third party but the shareholder must compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)). In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if he or she knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or imminent illiquidity, as the case may be, and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. With respect to an “affiliated party,” there is a general statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge.” The granting of security concurrently with the incurrence of debt may be qualified as a “cash transaction” (Bargeschäft). In case of such “cash transaction,” the avoidance risk can—under certain circumstances—substantially be reduced. However, according to the COVInsAG, the avoidance rights of an insolvency administrator are temporarily reduced in order to privilege new financings and shareholder loans made during a certain time during the COVID-19 pandemic. On that basis, the repayment (including reasonable interest payments) of third-party financing and shareholder loans by September 30, 2023 shall not be considered disadvantageous to creditors if the relevant financing is granted between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2021 and the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of the filing duties at the time. This privilege also covers the provision of collateral in favor of third-party financing providers, but does not apply in case of the provision of collateral to secure the repayment of shareholder loans or receivables resulting from legal transactions which are economically equivalent to a loan. Moreover, according to the COVInsAG, any congruent securities or satisfactions (i.e. securities or satisfactions that could be claimed in the manner and at the time) and certain incongruent securities or satisfactions being provided during the suspension period shall generally not be subject to any avoidance rights in subsequent insolvency proceedings (unless the creditor knew that the restructuring and refinancing efforts of the debtor were not suitable to eliminate an existing illiquidity of the debtor in the meaning of section 17 of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung)). In the case of deferrals, payments until March 31, 2022 on receivables for which a deferral was agreed until February 28, 2021 shall generally also not be subject to any avoidance rights in subsequent insolvency proceedings, provided that insolvency proceedings had not yet been opened against the debtor's assets by the end of February 18, 2021. However, these privileges in terms of avoidance rights do only apply in the framework of the COVInsAG. ----- Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator voiding transactions according to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also void any security right or payment performed under the relevant security right according to the German Law of Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz) in the absence of formal insolvency proceedings. The prerequisites vary to a certain extent from the rules described above and the avoidance periods are calculated from the date a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428
257_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,214,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,214.7,Germany,214.7.3,Preventive Restructuring Framework,"On January 1, 2021 the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (“StaRuG”), which implemented the EU Restructuring Directive entered into force. The StaRuG inter alia introduces a pre-insolvency restructuring procedure (“StaRuG-Scheme”). Through the early restructuring of its liabilities, a debtor shall be enabled to continue its business, in whole or in part, by changing the composition, conditions or structure of its assets and liabilities or any other part of its capital structure and thereby prevent insolvency proceedings. The prerequisite for a StaRuG-Scheme is that the debtor is imminently illiquid (drohend zahlungsunfähig), but not yet illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) or over-indebted (überschuldet). Restructuring proceedings under the StaRuG are initiated by an application of the debtor to the competent court and the submission of a restructuring concept. The key instrument of a StaRuG-Scheme is the restructuring plan (Restrukturierungsplan), in which the debtor can include all or only some of its creditors. The restructuring plan may address the creditors' claims (Restrukturierungsforderungen) and potential separation rights (Absonderungsanwartschaften), but also intra-group securities (gruppeninterne Drittsicherheiten) and the rights of the shareholders. To become effective, the plan requires the consent of the creditors, who - similar to the insolvency plan procedure (see above) - are divided into different groups. In principle, each group of creditors needs to consent to the plan with a majority of 75% of the value of the claims represented in that group. Despite the lack of approval of a group of creditors, the court may in principle put the restructuring plan into effect (“cram-down”) if (i) the majority of the creditor groups have agreed, (ii) the members of the dissenting group are not expected to be worse off by the plan than they would be without it, and (iii) the members of this group will receive a fair share of the economic value of the plan. Upon request of the debtor, the court can order additional measures to ensure a successful restructuring. In particular, it can temporarily prohibit the enforcement of claims (Vollstreckungssperre) and the realization of securities (Verwertungssperre). At the request of the debtor (or under certain conditions ex officio) the court may appoint a restructuring practitioner (Sanierungsbeauftragter). Therefore, as a general rule, the claims against the Guarantors (if the Guarantors have their “center of main interests” (COMI) in Germany and the StaRuG therefore applies) may be subject to certain restructuring measures (and even a haircut) under the StaRuG, if the Guarantor became imminent illiquid. Restructuring plans which are public and confirmed by a German restructuring court will be recognized in any EU member state pursuant to the EU Insolvency Proceedings Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings) upon such proceeding being included as a recognized proceeding in Exhibit A of that Regulation. In any other case, the recognition of the restructuring plan is subject to certain rules and regulations under applicable international private law.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

KG”) (hereinafter jointly referred to as a “German Subsidiary Guarantors” and each a “German Subsidiary Guarantor”). Consequently, the granting of a Guarantee by such German Subsidiary Guarantor is subject to certain provisions relating to preservation of the statutory capital under the German Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbHG”). These provisions would also apply to any future guarantor incorporated in the form of a GmbH or established as a limited partnership with a limited liability company as general. The enforcement of the relevant Guarantee will be limited if, and to the extent, payments under the Guarantee would cause the amount of such German Subsidiary Guarantor’s (or in the case the German Subsidiary Guarantor is a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner’s) net assets (i.e., total assets less liabilities and liability reserves) in accordance with the German Commercial Code (HGB) to fall below the amount of its stated share capital. As a general rule, the provisions of the GmbHG prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbHs net assets would fall below the amount of its stated share capital (Stammkapital) or an already negative amount of its net assets would further be reduced and prohibit payments to shareholders which render the German Subsidiary Guarantor unable to pay its debts as they fall due. Guarantees by a German Subsidiary Guarantor in respect of liabilities or payments of a direct or indirect parent or sister company as well as payments under any arrangements that are not at arm’s length terms are considered disbursements under the provisions of the GmbHG. In order to enable German Subsidiary Guarantors to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating the provisions of the GmbHG and to limit any potential personal liability of management, it is standard market practice for credit agreements, indentures and guarantees to contain so called “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated in Germany in the legal form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG. Pursuant to such “limitation language”, the secured parties contractually agree, subject to certain exceptions, to enforce the guarantees against a German subsidiary which is a GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG (or to release the proceeds of an enforcement, as applicable) only if and to the extent that such enforcement does not result in the subsidiary’s— or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, in the general partner’s—net asset falling below the amount of its stated share capital or increasing such shortfall in order to avoid a violation of the applicable provisions of the GmbHG. Accordingly, as a matter of German corporate law, the documentation with respect to the Guarantee, to the extent provided by a German Subsidiary Guarantor, contains or will contain such contractual limitation language. This could lead to a situation in which the respective Guarantee granted by such German Subsidiary Guarantor cannot be enforced at all and the holders of the Notes will lose the benefit of the Guarantee. The German capital maintenance rules and the other provisions referred to above are subject to evolving case law. We cannot assure you that future court rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of German Subsidiary Guarantors, which can negatively affect the ability of the Issuer to make payment on the notes or of a German Subsidiary Guarantor to make payments on the Guarantee. In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding so called “destructive interference” (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a shareholder deprives a German Subsidiary Guarantor of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of the Guarantee granted by a German Subsidiary Guarantor. In such case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero. According to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the distressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of the Guarantee by a German Subsidiary Guarantor. Furthermore, the beneficiary of a transaction effecting a repayment of the stated share capital of the respective German Subsidiary Guarantor of the Guarantee could become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that a German Subsidiary ----- Guarantor when granting the Guarantee was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

The concept of real and adequate benefit is not defined in the applicable legislation, is assessed and determined by a factual analysis on a case by case basis and its existence is a business decision of the directors and the statutory auditors, if any. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant company on a stand-alone basis, although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. While corporate benefit for downstream guarantee or security (i.e., a guarantee guaranteeing or a security interest granted to secure financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) is usually self-evident, the validity and effectiveness of up-stream or cross stream security or guarantee (i.e., security or guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor) granted by an entity organized under the laws of Italy depend on the existence of a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the granted security interest or guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be proved that the grantor may derive adequate benefits or advantages from the granting of such guarantee or security. In particular, in case of an up-stream and cross-stream guarantee or security for the financial obligations of group companies, examples may include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through intercompany loans from other members of the group, while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions to shareholders are largely untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to whether and to what extent such transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate benefit and conflict of interest. Generally, the risk assumed by an Italian grantor of security or guarantor under a guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it. As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the transaction (including granting a security interest or a guarantee entered into) by an Italian company ultra vires and potentially affected by a conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be the subject matter of challenges and annulment. Civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of an Italian grantor if a court holds that it did not act in the best interest of the grantor and that the acts carried out do not fall within the corporate purpose of the company or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also result in the imposition of civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising control over an Italian grantor or having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control. Moreover if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party and such third party acted intentionally against the interest of the Italian company, this could have an impact on the effectiveness and enforceability of the security interest or guarantee granted by such Italian company. The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to up-stream, cross-stream and down-stream guarantees or security interests granted by Italian companies. Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity within the meaning of Article 106 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993 (the “Italian Banking Act”), whose exercise is exclusively demanded to banks and authorized financial intermediaries. Non-compliance with the provisions of the Italian Banking Act may, among others, entail the relevant guarantees being considered null and void. In this respect, Italian Ministerial Decree No. 53 of April 2, 2015, implementing Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Italian Banking Act, states that the issuance of guarantees or the granting of security by a company for the obligations of another company which is part of the same group does not qualify as a restricted financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling and controlled companies within the meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as companies which are under the control of the same entity. As a result of the above described rules, subject to the relevant guarantors and the guaranteed entity being part of the same group of companies, the provision of the guarantees would not amount to a restricted financial activity. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

In this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata, such loan will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when, ----- taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan (“undercapitalization”). Any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior to a bankruptcy declaration would be required to be returned to the borrower. The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly. As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above. Some of such precedents have held that article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated as società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are incorporated as società per azioni. Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian courts may apply such provisions of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s relationship with Italian subsidiaries under the relevant intercompany loans. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the obligations of any Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loan are subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should any of the obligations of any subsidiary under any intercompany loan or note be deemed subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under any intercompany loan or note granted to the Italian subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes. Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans or notes are subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any Collateral created over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees and/or security interests granted by such Italian subsidiaries (including the Guarantees) may be impaired or restricted. However, due to the COVID-19 emergency, the Italian Government issued the so-called “Decreto liquidità” (i.e., Law Decree April 8, 2020, no. 23, published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on April 8, 2020 and converted in law by the Italian Parliament by the Law June 5, 2020, no. 40, published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on June 6, 2020 the “Liquidity Decree”) according to which pursuant to its article 8, the provisions summarized above are temporarily frozen and therefore loans granted by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata during the period between April 9, 2020 and December 31, 2020 are exempted from the application of the so-called “equitable subordination” rule.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

The two primary goals of the Italian law are first, to maintain employment, and second, to liquidate the debtor’s assets for the satisfaction of creditors. These competing goals often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns (ramo d’azienda) and by ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. Under Italian law, in the event that the Italian Guarantor becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees given by it by way of parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential challenges by the appointed bankruptcy receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness or avoidance or clawback of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the debtor during the suspect period. For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of clawback actions in an insolvency scenario, see “—Certain Italian _Insolvency Laws_ _Considerations—Bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento)” below. If challenged successfully, the guarantee may_ become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of the guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts. Furthermore, in the event that the limitations on the guarantee issued by an Italian Guarantor apply and/or there are payment obligations under any Notes other than in respect of principal or interest, the holders of the Notes could have a reduced claim against the relevant guarantor. According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, guarantee and rights in general may be subject to, among others, the following aspects: ----- - the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed below relating to or affecting the rights of creditors; - an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement, precautionary measures or remedy, the availability of which is subject to equitable consideration or which is otherwise at the discretion of the Court; - with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive), each party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer to perform its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Article 1460 of the Italian Civil Code; - claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of Italian law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni e decadenze) or may be or become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim (including counterclaims related to counterparties’ default (eccezione di inadempimento)); - pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations (compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for the correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation or fungible assets of the same kind and are equally liquid, due and payable; - where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter in its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such opinion is based on reasonable grounds; - the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be limited by the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di applicazione necessaria) and by the fact that the relevant provisions of foreign laws may be deemed contrary to Italian public policy principles and there is no case law setting out specific criteria for the application of such legal concepts under Italian law; - there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement or instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would survive such judgment might not be held to do so; - enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del diritto); - the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument may be subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation pursuant to the provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code; - any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal, invalid, not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in order to save those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the interpretation of intention of the parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties following the execution of such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code); - an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for the purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the Italian Civil Code are satisfied; - an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such interest being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis; - in case of bankruptcy, a receiver in bankruptcy is appointed by the court to administer the proceeding under the supervision of the bankruptcy court and creditors’ committee and creditors cannot start or continue individual foreclosure actions (including the enforcement of security interests) against the debtor (automatic stay). Furthermore, the sale of the relevant pledged assets is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee is expressly authorized by the bankruptcy court; ----- - in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment to the relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable date (data certa); the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of ensuring that a document has an undisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the relevant document by one of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary who states the date of witnessing on the document; - there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning advance waivers or forfeitures; - the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented by Italian law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct (dolo) or the violation of mandatory provisions; - penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court; - any obligation of an Italian company and/or any obligation secured or guaranteed by an Italian company, which is in violation of certain Italian mandatory or public policy rules (including, among others, any obligation to pay: (i) any portion of interest exceeding the thresholds of the interest rate permitted under the Italian law no. 108 of March 7, 1996 (i.e., the Italian usury law), as amended from time to time and related implementing rules and regulations; and (ii) any portion of interest deriving from any compounding of interest which does not comply with Italian law, including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code, according to which, accrued and unpaid interest can be capitalized only after legal proceedings to recover the debt were started or in the event the interest were unpaid and capitalized for not less than six months based on an agreement executed after the relevant maturity date and Article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree no. 385/1993 (i.e., the Italian Banking Act)) may not be enforceable; - if a party to an agreement is aware of the invalidity of that agreement and does not inform the other parties to that agreement of such invalidity, it is liable for the damages suffered by such other parties as a consequence of having relied upon the validity of the agreement; - Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or litigation.

An Italian court could revoke the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to make the two following findings: - that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor, or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and - that, in the case of non-gratuitous acts, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if the act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in the fraudulent design.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

In Italy, courts play a central role in the insolvency process. Moreover, in court procedures may be materially more complex and the enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be more time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which holders of the Notes may be familiar. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not include special provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorized to carry out certain reserved activities nor it provides a comprehensive description of insolvency laws application where publicly-owned companies are involved. ----- Certain provisions of Italian law have been amended or have entered into force only recently and, therefore, may be subject to further implementation and/or interpretations and have not been tested to date in the Italian courts. To this extent, it shall be noted that Italian insolvency laws and regulations have recently been substantially reviewed and significant amendments are expected in the near future. In particular, the Italian government approved on January 12, 2019 the Legislative Decree No. 14 implementing the guidelines contained in Law No. 155 dated October 19, 2017 (the “Legislative Decree”), which enacts a new comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, among others, insolvency matters (so-called “Code _of Business Crisis and Insolvency,” hereinafter the “Insolvency Code”). Legislative Decree was published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on February 14, 2019 no. 38—Suppl._ _Ordinario no. 6. The main innovations introduced by the Insolvency Code_ include: (i) the elimination of the term “bankrupt” (fallito) due to its negative connotation and the replacement of bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) with a judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale); (ii) a new definition of “state of crisis”: (iii) the adoption of the same procedural framework in order to ascertain such state of crisis and to access the different judicial insolvency proceedings provided for by the same Insolvency Code; (iv) a new set of rules concerning group restructurings; (v) restrictions to the use of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) in order to favor going concern proceedings; (vi) a new preventive alert and mediation phase to avoid insolvency; (vii) jurisdiction of specialized courts over proceedings involving large debtors; (viii) amendments to certain provisions of the Italian Civil Code aimed at ensuring the general effectiveness of the reform. However, the main provisions set out in the Insolvency Code have not yet come into force and, due to the COVID-19 emergency, the Liquidity Decree states that the date on which the Insolvency Code will come into force is postponed to September 1, 2021 (whilst, according to the original provision of the Insolvency Code, it should have come into force on August 15, 2020). Therefore, the practical consequences of its implementation and its potential impact on the existing insolvency proceedings cannot to date be foreseen and significant amendments are expected in the near future that may impact the provisions set forth therein. In light of the foregoing, and for the sake of clarity, the following paragraphs will only focus on the Italian insolvency laws and regulations already applicable and into force as of the date hereof (and will not take into account, therefore, the provisions of the Insolvency Code which will enter into force only on September 1, 2021).Certain provisions of Italian law have been amended or have entered into force only recently and, therefore, may be subject to further implementation and/or interpretations and have not been tested to date in the Italian courts. In this respect, without prejudice to the above-mentioned approval of the Insolvency Code, the most recent reforms that have been implemented by the Italian government on the main Italian bankruptcy legislation as defined below are: (i) the reform approved on June 23, 2015, through a Law Decree containing urgent reforms applicable, among others, to Italian bankruptcy law (the “Decree”). The Decree entered into force in June 2015 (the date of its publication in the Gazzetta Ufficiale) and has been converted into law by Italian Law No. 132 of August 6, 2015, entered into force on August 21, 2015 (the date after its publication in the Gazzetta Ufficiale) and (ii) the amendments implemented by means of the adoption of (a) the Decree No. 59 of May 3, 2016, converted into law by Italian Law No. 119 of June 30, 2016, and (b) Italian Law No. 232 of December 11, 2016. As a preliminary remark, it should be noted that the main Italian bankruptcy regulation is the Italian Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16, 1942, as reformed and currently in force (the “Italian Bankruptcy Law”), The two primary aims of the Italian Bankruptcy Law are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claims. On the other hand, other particular insolvency procedures, such as “Prodi-bis” extraordinary administration procedure or “Marzano” extraordinary administration procedure, which will be addressed as well in the following paragraphs, also target to the preservation of significant employment levels. These competing aims have often been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. However, the Italian Bankruptcy Law has been recently amended with a view to promoting rescue procedures rather than liquidation, focusing on the continuity and survival of financially distressed businesses and enhancing pre-bankruptcy restructuring options. Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy (fallimento) must be declared by a court, based on the insolvency (insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/or one or more creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Article 5 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent rather than a temporary status of insolvency, in order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent. In cases where a company is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, financial distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company, but which are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions. The following debt restructuring and bankruptcy alternatives are available under Italian law for companies in a state of crisis and for insolvent companies. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

However, in cases where a company is solvent, but facing financial difficulties, it may be possible to enter into an out-of-court arrangement with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

An independent expert appointed directly by the debtor must verify the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business data provided by the company. There is no need to obtain court approval to appoint the expert. The expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet the requirements set forth, among others, by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case of misrepresentation or false certification. Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not under any form of judicial control or approval and, therefore, no application is required to be filed with the court or supervising authority. Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not required to be approved and consented to by a specific majority of all outstanding claims. The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable but they may not be adopted to liquidate and dismiss the business of the company, but shall provide for the restructuring of the debtor’s indebtedness and the rebalancing of the debtor’s financial condition on a going concern basis. Unlike in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans do not offer the debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these plans fail and the debtor be declared bankrupt, the payments and/or acts carried out, and/or security interest created as implementation of the certified plan (a) are not subject to bankruptcy claw-back action; and (b) are exempted from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the Companies’ Register are needed (although publication in the Companies’ Register is possible upon a debtor’s request and would allow to certain tax benefits), and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement or a debt restructuring agreement. Since the reorganization plan is not subject to any court approval or judicial review, it cannot be excluded that the above-mentioned exemption effects may be challenged in the event of subsequent bankruptcy, if the competent court were to assess that the reorganization plan was not feasible at the time it was certified by the independent expert.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

An independent expert appointed by the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company and declare that the restructuring agreement is feasible and that it ensures that the debts towards the nonparticipating creditors can be fully satisfied within the following terms: (a) 120 days from the date of approval of the agreement by the court, in the case of debts which are due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (b) 120 days from the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of debts which are not yet due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, only a debtor who is insolvent or in a situation of “financial distress” (i.e., facing financial crisis which does not yet amount to insolvency) can initiate this process and request the court’s approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors. The agreement is published in the companies’ register and is effective as of the day of its publication. Starting from the date of such publication and for 60 days thereafter, creditors cannot start or continue any conservative or enforcement action against the assets of the debtor in relation to pre-existing receivables and cannot obtain any security interest (unless agreed) in relation to preexisting debts. The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the debt restructuring agreement. The restructuring agreement (and the underlying business and financial plan) can therefore provide, among others, either for the continuation of the business by the debtor or by a third party, or for the sale of the business ----- to a third party, and may provide for refinancing agreements, moratoria, write-offs and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. The 60-days stay of actions period can also be requested by the debtor to the court, pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, while negotiations with creditors are still pending (i.e., prior to the above-mentioned publication of the agreement), subject to certain conditions. Such request for stay of actions must be published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the date of publication. The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation filed by the debtor, sets the date for a hearing within 30 days of the publication and orders the debtor to supply to the creditors the relevant documentation in relation to the stay of actions request. At such hearing, creditors and other interested parties may file an opposition to the agreement and the court assesses whether the conditions for granting the stay of action are in place and, in such case, orders that no interim relief or enforcement action may be started or continued, nor can security interests (unless agreed) be acquired over the assets of the debtor, and sets a deadline (not exceeding 60 days) within which a debt restructuring agreement and the assessment by the expert must be filed. Nevertheless, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree, provides, in relation to the proceeding for the approval (omologazione) of the debtrestructuring agreements under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law already pending as of February 23, 2020, that the debtor which has already been granted such extension by the court, can, before the expiry of the deadline, request for a further extension up to 90 days even if there is a petition for bankruptcy declaration pending against it. The petition requesting such additional extension shall provide for the elements that make it necessary to grant the extension with specific reference to the events that have occurred as a result of the COVID-19 epidemiological emergency. The court, after having obtained the opinion of the judicial commissioner (if appointed), grants the extension when it considers that the application is based on real and reasonable grounds (concreti e giustificati motivi). The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same time frame, an application for the court supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed, without prejudice to the effect of the stay of actions. Creditors and other interested parties may challenge the agreement within 30 days from the publication of the agreement in the companies’ register. After having settled the challenges (if any) the court will validate the agreement by issuing a decree, which can be appealed within 15 days of its publication. The Italian Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015 introduced Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, which provides certain specific provisions with respect to debt-restructuring agreement executed with financial creditors (provided that certain conditions are met). Pursuant to Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended by and converted into law by Law 132/2015, debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness are entitled to enter into debt restructuring agreements pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law providing for different categories of financial creditors having analogous legal situation and economic interests. In such respect, provided that financial creditors representing at least 75% of the aggregate financial claims of the relevant category are adhering to the restructuring agreement, the debtor can ask the court to declare such agreement binding also on the dissenting financial creditors belonging to the same category (so-called “cram down”), subject to certain conditions being met, including that treatment of dissenting creditors is not worse than under any other available alternative and that all creditors (adhering and non-adhering) have been informed about the negotiations and have been allowed to take part in them in good faith. If the abovementioned conditions are met, then the remaining 25% (or lower percentage) of non-participating financial creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are crammed down; however, crammed down creditors can challenge the deal and refuse to be forced into it, on the basis of the lack of homogeneity of the classes of creditors. Pursuant to Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the debtor may also enter into a moratorium arrangement (convenzione di moratoria) with its creditors which are banks and financial intermediaries by which also the non consenting banks and financial intermediaries are bound, provided that (i) the adhering financial creditors represent at least 75% of that debtor’s aggregate financial indebtedness; (ii) non-adhering creditors have been informed of the ongoing negotiations and have been allowed to participate to such negotiations in good faith, and (iii) an independent expert meeting the requirements provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law certifies that the non-consenting banks and financial intermediaries have legal status and economic interests similar to those of the banks and financial intermediaries which have agreed to the moratorium arrangement. The banks and financial intermediaries which have not agreed to the moratorium arrangement may file an objection (opposizione) to it within 30 days of receipt of the application. In no case the debt restructuring agreement provided for under article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or the moratorium arrangement may impose on the non-adhering creditors, among others, the performance of new obligations, the maintenance of the possibility to utilize the existing facilities or the granting of new facilities. ----- Such debt restructuring agreements and standstill agreements will not affect the rights of non-financial creditors (e.g., trade creditors) who cannot be crammed down and must be paid within 120 days if not participating to a scheme. Pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financing granted to the debtor pursuant to the approved debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors) (concordato preventivo) ranks super- senior status under Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law in case of subsequent bankruptcy (such status also applies to financing granted by shareholders, but only up to 80% of such financing – unless the lender has become shareholder as implementation of the debt-restructuring agreement under Article 182-bis or of the _concordato preventivo proceeding). Financing granted “in view of” (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for the approval (omologazione) of a debt restructuring agreement under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a court- supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors may be granted such super-senior status under Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law provided that it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such status is expressly recognized by the court in the context of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement or the approval of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) The same provisions apply to financings granted by shareholders up to 80% of their amount (unless the lender has become shareholder as implementation of the debt-restructuring agreement under Article 182-bis or of the concordato preventivo proceeding). Moreover, pursuant to Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the Court, pending the approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a petition pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (in relation to the court supervised pre-bankruptcy arrangement with creditors procedure described below) may authorize the debtor, if so expressly requested: (i) to incur in new super senior indebtedness and to secure such indebtedness with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims by way of security, provided that the expert appointed by the debtor (which shall be in possession of certain requirements), having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione), declares that the new financing aims at providing a better satisfaction of the rights of the creditors, and (ii) to pay pre-existing debts deriving from the supply of services or goods, to the extent already payable and due, provided that the expert declares that such payment is essential for the keeping of the company’s activities and to ensure the best satisfaction for all creditors. The provision of Article 182-quinques of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both debt restructuring agreement and to the court-supervised pre-bankruptcy compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo) outlined below. Furthermore, according to Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, pending the approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182- bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a petition pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court may also authorize the debtor to incur in new super senior (so-called prededucibile) and urgent financial indebtedness, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business. The company, while filing such request of authorization, is required to specify (i) the purpose of the financing; (ii) that it is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds and (iii) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the company. Such authorization request can also be filed in relation to maintaining short-term facilities (linee di credito _autoliquidanti) already in place as of the filing date._",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

Such composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness (including debts not yet due) in excess of €0.5 million. Only the debtor company can initially file a petition with the court for a _concordato _preventivo (together with, among others, a restructuring plan and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the_ composition proposal and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company). The petition for _concordato preventivo is then published in the company’s register by the registry of the court. From the date of such publication_ to the date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo, all enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors (whose claims arose prior to the publication of the petition for concordato preventivo in the company’s register) are stayed. According to prevailing case law of the Italian Supreme Court (absent any specific provisions of law in such respect), ----- bankruptcy petitions filed both before and after the opening of the concordato preventivo procedure are frozen throughout the procedure to the extent that the concordato procedure is and remains feasible, and subsequently dismissed in the event of ratification (omologazione) of the concordato preventivo by the court. Preexisting creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the concordato preventivo is published in the company’s register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors. The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for, inter alia: (i) the restructuring and payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it will ensure payment of at least 20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors with continuity of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale) pursuant to Article 186-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into classes; and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. The filing of the petition for concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary petition for a _concordato preventivo (so-called concordato in bianco, pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as_ amended by Italian Law Decree No. 69/2013 as converted into Italian Law No. 98/2013 (“Law Decree 69/2013”)). The debtor may file such petition along with: (i) its financial statements from the latest three financial years; and (ii) the list of creditors with the reference to the amount of their respective receivables, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant documentation within a period assigned by the court between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension (giustificati motivi). Nevertheless, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree, provides, in relation to concordato preventivo proceedings already pending as of February 23, 2020,_ that the debtor which has already been granted such extension by the Court, can, before the expiry of the deadline, request for a further extension up to 90 days even if there is a petition for bankruptcy declaration pending against it. The petition requesting such additional extension shall provide for the elements that make it necessary to grant the extension with specific reference to the events that have occurred as a result of the COVID-19 epidemiological emergency. The Court, after having obtained the opinion of the judicial commissioner (if appointed), grants the extension when it considers that the application is based on real and reasonable grounds (concreti e _giustificati motivi)._ In advance of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the approval of a debt restructuring agreement (pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). If the court accepts such preliminary petition, it may: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 173 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of nonexistent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), will report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may reject the petition for _concordato preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting and information duties of the company during the abovementioned period._ The statutory provisions providing for the stay of enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors referred to in respect of the concordato preventivo also apply to preliminary petitions for concordato preventivo (so-called concordato in bianco). The debtor company may not file such pre-application where it had already done so in the previous two years without the admission to the _concordato preventivo having followed. The decree setting the term for the presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to the financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor company will file, on a monthly basis, its financial position, which is published, the following day, in the company’s register. Noncompliance with these requirements results in the petition for concordato preventivo being declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are met, in the declaration of bankruptcy of the distressed company. If the activities carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inadequate for the preparation of the concordato preventivo proposal and the restructuring plan, the court may, ex officio, after hearing the debtor and—if appointed—the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents. ----- Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent they are urgent. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company after the filing of concordato preventivo petition (including preliminary petition) and new super senior indebtedness authorized by the court, pending the approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of a concordato preventivo petition (including a preliminary petition under article 161 para. 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law), aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business, are treated as super-senior (so-called _prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the related acts, payments and security interests_ granted are exempted from the claw-back actions provided under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The concordato preventivo proposal may provide, inter alia, that: (i) the debtor’s company’s business continues to be run by the debtor’s company as a going concern; or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more companies and any assets which are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated (concordato con continuità aziendale). In these cases, the plan and petition for the concordato preventivo should fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert must also certify that the continuation of the business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition proposal was not implemented. Furthermore, the going concernbased arrangements with creditors can provide for, among others, the disposal of those assets that are not functional to the continuation of the business. The concordato preventivo plan and proposal may also provide for, inter alia, a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato) to supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial commissioners (commissari giudiziali) and calls the creditors’ meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its corporate bodies (usually its board of directors), but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge (who will authorize all transactions that exceed the ordinary course of business). The debtor is allowed to carry out urgent extraordinary transactions only upon the prior court’s authorization, while ordinary transactions may be carried out without authorization. Third-party claims, related to the interim acts legally carried out by the debtor, are super-senior (so-called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Pursuant to article 169-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the debtor may request the competent court to be authorized to terminate pending agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente eseguiti), except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above provision (e.g., employment agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato), certain real estate preliminary sale agreements and real estate lease agreements (contratti di locazione di immobili)). The request may be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the petition for concordato preventivo or to the judge (giudice _delegato), if the application is made after admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending agreements can_ also be suspended for a period of time not exceeding 60 days, renewable just once. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification is treated as a receivable preceding the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo). The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved with the favorable vote of (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote; and, in the event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, also by (b) the majority of the classes. The pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors is approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of the proposal. Creditors who did not exercise their voting rights in the creditors’ meeting can do so (even via email) within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting and, after such term, creditors who did not exercise their voting right will be deemed not to approve the concordato preventivo proposal. In relation to voting by the holder of the Notes in the concordato preventivo proceeding, the interaction between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies is untested in the Italian courts. Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the _concordato preventivo proposal provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of their claim (provided that they receive,_ at least, an amount equal to the fair market value of their secured assets, as assessed by an independent expert). In such latter case, they can vote only in respect of the part of their claim affected by the proposal. The court may also approve the concordato _preventivo (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved_ it; and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the dissenting creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared ----- to other solutions. If an objection to the implementation of the concordato _preventivo is filed by 20% of the creditors or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a dissenting class, entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless approve the concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case. The court approves the concordato preventivo even without the vote of the tax authority or the social contribution entities (enti gestori di forme di previdenza o assistenza _obbligatorie) when their accession is decisive for the purposes of achieving the majorities referred to in Article 177 of the_ Italian Bankruptcy Law and when, also on the basis of the results of the report by the independent expert referred to in Article 161, Paragraph 3 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the proposal to satisfy the aforesaid authorities and entities is convenient compared to the liquidation alternative. Creditors (except for individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least 10% of the aggregate claims against the debtor can present a plan alternative to the debtor’s plan in the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular, that the proposal of the debtor does not ensure recovery of at least (i) 40% of the unsecured claims (crediti _chirografari) in case of pre- bankruptcy composition with creditors with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio), or (ii) 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale). In addition, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, a pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e., a pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors aiming at the sale of all the assets in the interest of the creditors under the supervision of the judicial commissioner) must ensure that the unsecured creditors are paid in a percentage of at least 20% of their claims. This provision does not apply to pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors proposal based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale). To the extent the alternative plan is approved by the creditors and ratified (omologato), the court may grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including the power to take all corporate actions required. In addition, Article 163-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, provides that, if a plan in a pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, includes an offer for the sale of the debtor’s assets or of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the Court must open a competitive bidding process. After the approval by the creditors’ meeting, the court (having settled possible objections raised by the dissenting creditors, if any) confirms the concordato preventivo proposal by issuing a confirmation order. If the creditors’ meeting does not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request of the public prosecutor or a creditor, and having decided that the appropriate conditions apply, declare the company bankrupt. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree, the deadlines for the fulfilment of concordati preventivi and the ratified debt restructuring agreements (accordi di ristrutturazione omologati) expiring after February 23, 2020 were extended by six months. Moreover, Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree also provides for: (i) upon certain circumstances, the possibility to request a deadline to the court in order to file a new plan and new proposal to creditors, in order to supersede the previous ones; (ii) in relation to a petition for concordato preventivo and/or a debt restructuring agreements under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law filed up until December 31, 2021, the right of the debtor to file, within December 31, 2021, a deed of renunciation (atto di rinuncia) whereby it declares that it has prepared and published in the competent companies’ register a reorganization plan under Article 67, Paragraph 3, letter (d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and provides evidence of the publication thereof.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428
257_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,214,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,214.8,Italy,214.8.14,Bankruptcy Proceedings (Fallimento),"A request to declare a debtor bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) for the judicial liquidation of its assets can be filed by the debtor, any of its creditors and, in certain cases, the public prosecutor when a debtor is insolvent. Insolvency, as defined under Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations with ordinary means as they come due. Bankruptcy is declared by the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori _commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three ----- preceding fiscal years; (ii) has had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness (including debts not yet due) in excess of €0.5 million. Bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a deputy judge (giudice delegato), a court-appointed bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a representative of any one of the creditors, and is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor to the satisfaction of creditors as a whole. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority. Upon the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, amongst other things: - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed and creditors must file claims within a defined period; - under certain circumstances secured creditors may enforce the security interests granted in relation to their claims as soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of liquidation of the secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject to any relevant expenses. In case the sale price is not high enough to determine a full satisfaction of their credits, any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. Secured creditors may sell the secured asset only with the court authorization. After hearing the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare) and the creditors’ committee, the court decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the relevant timing in its decision; - the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are transferred to the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare); - continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater damage to the company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to creditors; - any act (including payments, pledges, and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor (other than those made by through the receiver) after (and in certain cases even before for a limited period of time) the declaration of bankruptcy, becomes (or could become, if made before) ineffective against creditors; and - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. In order to overcome the uncertainty that may predictably arise, the contractual counterparty may file a written petition requiring the court to give the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare) a deadline of no more than 60 days, within which the bankruptcy receiver must decide whether to enter into the pending agreement or withdraw from it. Upon expiration of the deadline without the receiver having replied to the counterparty’s request, the agreement is deemed terminated. Although the general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations have not been performed, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by Italian Bankruptcy Law. The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real estate properties. In this respect, Law 132/2015 amended the relevant provision of the Italian Bankruptcy Law which sets forth the requirements applicable to the liquidation procedure and, as a consequence, the timing for the liquidation of the debtor’s assets is shortened. Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for priority of payment to certain preferential creditors, including employees, the Italian treasury, and judicial and social authorities. Such priority of payment is provided under mandatory provisions of law (as a consequence it is untested and it is unlikely that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements would be recognized by an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). Unsecured creditors are satisfied after payment of preferential and secured creditors, out of available funds and assets (if any) as below indicated. - **Bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato fallimentare). Bankruptcy proceedings can terminate prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors. The relevant petition can be filed by one or more creditors or third parties starting from the declaration of bankruptcy, whereas the debtor or its subsidiaries are permitted to file such a proposal only after one year following such declaration but within two years from the decree giving effectiveness to the liabilities account (stato passivo). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato _fallimentare, unless and to the extent they waive their security or ----- the concordato fallimentare proposal provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of their claim (provided that they receive, at least, an amount equal to the fair market value of their secured assets, as assessed by an independent expert). In such latter case they can vote only in respect of the part of their claim affected by the proposal. The petition may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different treatments among the classes), and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner. The _concordato _fallimentare proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the creditors holding the majority (by_ value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, also by a majority (by value) of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court ratification is also required. - **Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may be different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU jurisdictions. Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of “predeductible” (i.e. super senior) claims (including, inter alia, claims originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are paid) are the claims of preferential creditors, including the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators, and claims for employee wages. The remaining priorities of claims are, in order of priority, those related to secured creditors (creditori privilegiati; a preference in payment in most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law), mortgages (creditori ipotecari), pledges (creditori prignoratizi) and, lastly, unsecured creditors (crediti _chirografari). Under Italian law, the proceeds from the sale of the bankrupt’s estate are distributed according to_ legal rules of priority. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from these priority rules by proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles (as a consequence, it must be noted that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual agreements may not be enforceable against Italian bankruptcy estate to the event they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). The law creates a hierarchy of claims that must be adhered to when distributing the proceeds derived from the sale of the entire bankrupt’s estate or part thereof, or of a single asset. - **Avoidance powers in insolvency. Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back” or avoidance provisions under Italian law that may give rise, among others, to the revocation of payments made or security interests granted by the debtor prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. The key avoidance provisions address transactions made below market value, preferential transactions and transactions made with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back rules under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in bankruptcy compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions. In bankruptcy proceedings, depending on the circumstances, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to one year (six months in certain circumstances) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions. Please note that in the context of extraordinary administration procedures (as described below), in relation to certain transactions, the claw-back period can be extended up to three or five years in certain circumstances. The Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or transactions which are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner, as detailed below. - **Acts ineffective by operation of law. (i) Under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited exception, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law becomes part of the bankruptcy estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the declaration of bankruptcy, without need to wait that the ineffectiveness of the transaction is sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge for violation of law; and (ii) under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are deemed ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity within the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. - Acts that could be declared ineffective at the request of the bankruptcy receiver / court commissioner. a. The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be clawed back (revocati) vis-à-vis the bankruptcy as provided for by Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and be declared ineffective, unless the non-insolvent party proves that it had no ----- actual or constructive knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into: i. onerous transactions entered into in the year before the insolvency declaration, when the value of the debt or the obligations undertaken by the bankrupt entity exceeds 25% of the value of the consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor; ii. payments of debts, due and payable, which were not made by the debtor in cash or by other customary means of payment in the year prior to the insolvency declaration; iii. pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the year prior to the insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which were not yet due at the time when the new security was granted; and iv. pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the six months prior to the insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which had already fallen due at the time when the new security was granted. b. The following acts and transactions, if made during the period specified below, may be clawed back (revocati) and declared ineffective if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the non-insolvent party knew that the bankrupt entity was insolvent at the time of the act or transaction: i. payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions entered into or made within six months prior to the insolvency declaration; and ii. granting of security interest for debts, simultaneously created, incurred in the six months prior to the insolvency declaration. c. The following transactions are exempted from claw-back actions: i. payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market practice; ii. a remittance on a bank account; provided that it does not materially and permanently reduce the bankrupt entity’s debt towards the bank; iii. the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian Civil Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three degrees of kinship) or a non-residential property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser; provided that, as at the date of the insolvency declaration, the activity is actually exercised therein or the investments for the commencement of such activity have been carried out therein; iv. transactions entered into, payments made and guarantees and security interests granted by the debtor pursuant to a plan (piano attestato) under Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (see “—Out of Court Reorganization Plans (Piani di Risanamento) _Pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law” above);_ v. a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee and security interest granted in the context of a homologated “concordato preventivo” under Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (see “—Court Supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors _(Concordato Preventivo)” above) or an homologated “accordo di ristrutturazione del_ debito” under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (see “—Debt Restructuring _Agreements with Creditors Pursuant to Article 182 bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (Accordi di Ristrutturazione dei Debiti)” above), as well as any transactions, payment,_ security interests and/or guarantees carried out after the filing of a petition for concordato preventivo (see above); ----- vi. remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants concerning work carried out by them; and vii. payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to services necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedures. In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the bankrupt entity be declared ineffective vis-à-vis the acting creditors within the ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria), provided under Article 2901 of the Italian Royal Decree No 262 of March 16, 1942 (the “Italian Civil Code”). According to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions through which the bankrupt entity disposed of its assets prejudicially to such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided that the debtor (now bankrupt) was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the debtor (now bankrupt) for the purpose of prejudicing such creditor’s right) and that, in case of transactions entered into for consideration with a third party, the third party was aware of such prejudice (and, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third party participated in the fraudulent scheme). The burden of proof is entirely with the receiver. Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis of the Italian Civil Code, providing for a “simplified” claw-back action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a court decision clawing back/ nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so-called fondo patrimoniale or “family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be carried out by the creditor against the third-party purchaser.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

The procedure may be commenced by petition of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the public prosecutor. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to an extraordinary administration proceeding. Preferential payment is granted to those credits (even unsecured) accrued to allow the conduct of the company’s business activity. Extraordinary administration procedures involve two main phases—a judicial phase and an administrative phase. In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria and whether it is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three judicial commissioners (commissari giudiziali) to investigate whether there are serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or reorganization. The judicial commissioners submit(s) a report to the court (within 30 days) together with an opinion from the Italian Ministry of Economic Development (the “Ministry”). The court has 30 days to decide whether to admit the company to the procedure or place it into bankruptcy. If the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the administrative phase begins and the extraordinary commissioner(s) appointed by the Ministry prepare a restructuring plan. The plan can provide either for the sale of the business as a going concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Disposal Plan”) or for a reorganization leading to the company’s economic and financial recovery within two years (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Recovery Plan”). It may also include a composition with creditors (concordato). The plan must be approved by the Ministry within 30 days from submission by the extraordinary commissioner(s). In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the financial condition and interim management of the company and sends it to the Ministry. The procedure ends upon successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan; however, should either plan fail, the company will be declared bankrupt. If the Disposal Plan is approved, the extraordinary commissioner(s) can initiate claw-back actions according to the avoidance provisions set forth with respect to bankruptcy proceedings. If acts such as those that could be declared ineffective at the request of the bankruptcy receiver (see above) are put in place among companies belonging to the same group, the claw-back period is extended to up to three or five years. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

The Marzano procedure is intended to work faster than the Prodi-bis procedure. For example, although a company must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry can be made before the court commences the administrative phase. The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis, have at least 500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of debt (including those from outstanding guarantees). The decision whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry following the debtor’s request (who must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry assesses whether the relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will manage the company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency. The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to submit a Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be completed within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal or Recovery Plan is approved by the Ministry, the court will declare the company bankrupt and open bankruptcy proceedings. Unlike in the Prodi-bis procedure, in the Marzano procedure the extraordinary commissioner(s) can initiate claw-back actions also if a Recovery Plan is approved, provided that this results in a material benefit for the creditors.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

It is irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or the private sector. A compulsory administrative winding-up is special type of insolvency proceedings in which the entity is liquidated not by the bankruptcy court but by the relevant administrative authority that oversees the industry in which the entity is active. The procedure may be triggered not only by the insolvency of the relevant entity, but also by other grounds expressly provided for by the relevant legal provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of the bank or serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions). The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario liquidatore) is appointed to wind up the company. The liquidator’s actions are monitored by a steering committee (comitato di sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the designated judge and the bankruptcy court under the other insolvency proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative authority under this procedure. The effect of the forced administrative winding-up on creditors is largely the same as under bankruptcy proceedings and includes, for example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to a compulsory administrative winding-up.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

If the challenges are successful, the rights granted under the guarantees or in connection with security interests under the relevant security documents may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate.

In addition, article 1,851 of the Spanish Civil Code establishes that an extension granted to a debtor by a creditor without the consent of the guarantor extinguishes the personal guarantee (in the sense that it is limited to the original term, although case law has established exceptions where the extension benefits both the debtor and the guarantor). In general terms, under Spanish law, any guarantee or security interest must guarantee or secure a primary obligation to which it is ancillary. The primary obligation must be clearly identified in the guarantee or security agreement, and the nullity or termination of the primary obligation entails the nullity or termination of the ancillary guarantee or security interest. Consequently, if the primary obligation is terminated, the ancillary guarantee or security interest will also be deemed null and void. In the event that the guarantor or security provider is able to prove that there are no existing and valid guaranteed or secured obligations, Spanish courts may consider that the guarantor or security provider’s obligations under the relevant guarantee or security agreement are not enforceable. The enforcement of guarantees may be limited since the guarantor may not be required to pay any amount in excess of the amount owed by the principal debtor or under conditions that are less favorable than those applying to the principal debtor. In addition, a guarantee or security interest may not be enforced in Spain without having validly accelerated (totally or partially, as applicable) the underlying agreements governing the guaranteed or secured obligations, and may be affected by any amendment, supplement, waiver, repayment, novation or extinction of the secured obligations. A Spanish court may not accept acceleration (vencimiento anticipado) of an agreement if the default were of minimal importance (incumplimiento no esencial). To be recognized by the Spanish courts as giving rise to the remedy of acceleration, a default must be material. The decision to accelerate an agreement must be based on objective facts and cannot be left to the sole discretion of one party as this would not be permitted by article 1,256 of the Spanish Civil Code. Moreover, Spanish law may limit the ability of a Spanish Guarantor to guarantee the Notes or to grant security interests over its assets to secure the Notes. Recent Spanish rulings which do not constitute settled case law indicate, and certain scholars understand, that risk associated with a guarantee or the value of a security interest provided by a Spanish company to guarantee or secure indebtedness held by other companies within its corporate group must be reasonable and economically and operationally justified from the Spanish company’s perspective and justified under the corporate interest of such company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there are rulings from the Spanish Supreme Court recognizing the validity of upstream guarantees, specially were granted as an esencial element of the relevant financing which is guaranteed. Furthermore, the obligations of the Spanish Guarantor under its Guarantee or under any security instrument granted by it cannot extend to any obligation which, if incurred, would constitute a breach of the Spanish financial assistance rules. Pursuant to these rules, the obligations of the Spanish Guarantor under the Guarantee or any security granted or executed by it: - shall not extend to any use of the proceeds of the Notes for the purpose of acquiring shares representing the share capital of the Spanish Guarantor or shares representing the share capital of its direct or indirect parent company, ----- or refinancing a previous debt incurred for the acquisition of shares representing the share capital of the Spanish Guarantor or shares representing the share capital of its direct or indirect parent company; and - shall be deemed not to be undertaken or incurred by the Spanish Guarantor to the extent that the same would constitute unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of article 150 (for Spanish public limited companies (sociedades anónimas)) or article 143 (for the Spanish private limited liability companies (sociedades de _responsabilidad limitada) of the Spanish Companies Royal Decree-Law 1/2010, July 2(Ley de Sociedades de Capital) (the “Spanish Capital Companies Act”) and, in that case, all provisions of such Guarantee or security_ shall be construed accordingly in the sense that in no case can any Guarantee or security given by the Spanish Guarantor provides any such unlawful financial assistance. In particular, Spanish law prohibits financial assistance (i) for public limited liability companies (sociedades anónimas (S.A.)) in relation to the acquisition of their own shares or the shares of any direct or indirect parent company and (ii) for private limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada (S.L.)), in relation to the acquisition of their own shares and the shares of any member of their corporate group. Therefore, Spanish law governed guarantees or security interests granted or assumed by subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of Spain shall not extend to any payment obligation incurred by the Issuer for the purpose of acquiring the shares of such Spanish subsidiary or the shares of its direct or indirect parent company or, as applicable, any member of their group, to the extent that such security interest would constitute unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 150 and 143 of Spanish Decree 1/2010 dated July 2 on Spanish Corporations (Ley de _Sociedades de Capital). This limitation may also apply to the refinancing of acquisition debt, although this is widely debated_ between academics. Accordingly, any guarantee or security interest granted by any Spanish subsidiary shall not apply to the extent the proceeds are used to repay existing indebtedness of the Issuer if such existing indebtedness was used for the purposes described above. No whitewash procedures are available. Accordingly, the guarantee granted by any Spanish company will be limited by the amount of the funds that are not used for unlawful financial assistance purposes. For the purposes of the paragraphs above, a reference to a “holding company” or “parent company” of a Guarantor shall mean the company which, directly or indirectly, owns the majority of the voting rights of such Guarantor or that may have a dominant influence on such Guarantor. It shall be presumed that one company has a dominant influence on another company when (i) any of the scenarios set out in section 1 of article 42 of the Spanish Commercial Code (Código de Comercio) are met or (ii) when at least half plus one of the members of the managing body of the Spanish Guarantor are also members of the managing body or top managers (altos directivos) of the dominant company or of another company controlled by such dominant company. In addition, a reference to the “group” of the Spanish Guarantor shall mean the group of companies that have in common the same holding company (as this term is described above). Under Spanish law there are some provisions on capitalization which have to be taken into account when guarantees are enforced. For example, when the enforcement of the guarantee causes the amount of the relevant Spanish subsidiary net equity (patrimonio neto) to fall below half of its share capital, the Spanish subsidiary will need to be wound up (disolverse), unless its share capital is increased or decreased in the required amount to reestablish the balance between its net equity and its share capital and provided that it is not required to declare its insolvency. In addition, and while this remains a matter debated between Spanish scholars, it is possible that certain defenses available to the Spanish Guarantor relating to corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, capital preservation or thin capitalization may limit the amount guaranteed under the Guarantee by reference to the net assets and share capital of the Spanish Guarantor and the amount secured under the relevant security agreement by reference to the value of the collateral. Under the Spanish Capital Companies Act, Spanish companies (both public limited liability companies (sociedades _anónimas (S.A.)) and private limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada (S.L.))) may issue and_ guarantee (or provide security for) numbered series of notes and other securities that recognize or create debt, with certain restrictions applicable to limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada (S.L.)). In particular, pursuant to Section 401 of the Spanish Companies Act, the Guarantee provided by the Spanish Guarantor incorporated under the form of limited liability companies (“sociedades de responsabilidad limitada” or “S.L.s”), is subject to the following restrictions: (a) S.L.s can only issue and guarantee notes up to an aggregate maximum amount of twice its own equity (recursos propios), unless the issue is secured by a mortgage, a pledge of securities, a public guarantee or a joint guarantee from a credit institution S.L.s are prohibited to issue or guarantee (or provide security for) notes convertible into quota shares (participaciones sociales). ----- In respect of the restrictions applicable to limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada (S.L.)), there is no consistent opinion among scholars and practitioners yet nor case law regarding the interpretation of Section 401 of the Spanish Capital Companies Act. The terms “enforceable,” “enforceability,” “valid,” “legal,” “binding” and “effective” (or any combination thereof) mean that all of the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant documents are of a type enforced by Spanish courts; the terms do not mean that these obligations will necessarily be enforced in all circumstances in accordance with their terms. Enforcement before the courts will in any event be subject to: - the nature of the remedies available in the courts; - Spanish public policy (overriding mandatory provisions); and - the availability of defenses such as (without limitation) set-off (unless validly waived), circumvention of law (fraude de ley), abuse in the exercise of rights (abuso de derecho), misrepresentation, force majeure, unforeseen circumstances, undue influence, duress, abatement and counterclaim. Without, among others, notarization of the security documents, the secured parties will not have access to the executive summary proceedings (juicio ejecutivo) in case of judicial enforcement of the security documents in Spain, having the secured parties to follow necessarily the ordinary judicial proceedings (juicio ordinario). Additionally, the Spanish Capital Companies Act foresees a pre-emption right in favour of the shareholders in the context of enforcement proceedings. In particular, in the case of Spanish private limited companies (sociedades de _responsabilidad limitada), if not exercised by the quotaholders, such pre-emption right is granted to the company provided that_ it has been expressly foreseen in its by-laws. This may disincentive potential bidders to participate in execution proceedings of pledges of this type of securities.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

Therefore we cannot assure that by creating any such structure it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability by the Security Agent. If any challenge to the validity, perfection or enforceability of the security interests created by the security documents were successful, the holders of the Notes may be unable to enforce the security. Also, under Spanish law, in the event that the relevant obligor enters into insolvency proceedings, the securities or the parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator, the obligor itself or by other creditors of such obligor under the rules of avoidance or clawback of Spanish insolvency laws (acción rescisoria concursal) and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions by the debtor (acción rescisoria pauliana).",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

Unlike other jurisdictions, there is no concept of “corporate benefit” expressly regulated under the Spanish Companies Act or any other piece of legislation, However, Spanish lower courts, particularly Spanish commercial courts (Juzgados de lo _Mercantil) ruling on insolvency matters, are declaring null or rescinding upstream guarantees by applying the rebuttable_ presumption of actions detrimental to the estate of an affiliate granting guarantees or security interests in favor of the liabilities incurred by a parent company and/or other companies of its group for the purposes of article 226 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law (i.e., rescission or claw-back of these actions during the two year hardening period, as described above), when the obligations guaranteed or secured does not provide for a direct benefit to the Spanish company granting such guarantee or security interest. ----- Some decisions by the Spanish Supreme Court are ruling in favor of the validity and enforceability of such guarantees and security interests to the extent proof can be given that amounts can be borrowed directly by the company granting the guarantee or security interest or indirectly on-lent or otherwise made available to such company under a intercompany loan agreement, equity contribution or similar arrangement, also taking into account any indirect benefits deriving from the enhancement of the financial position of the group of companies to which such company belongs and the granting of parent guarantees, indemnities and comfort letters for which the relevant company obtains most favorable economic and financial conditions under its contractual relationships with suppliers and other counterparties, in accordance with Spanish case law existing as for the construction of the concept of “compensatory advantage” (ventaja compensatoria). However, it cannot be conclusively ensured that further proof of the actual existence of benefits and compensatory advantages would need to be delivered to court, to the insolvency administrator and/or the insolvency court in the event of an insolvency scenario where the claims of the holders of the Notes, particularly as “special privilege claims” may be challenged if the insolvency administrator or other creditors may allege that such corporate benefit did not exist.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

If Spanish law security documents are entered into only by a security agent (i.e., and not by the creditors on account of whom it would be acting), the security agent will be the only party entitled to enforce the Guarantee or the security interest in respect of those obligations and to have allowed a secured claim in an insolvency proceeding (only with respect to its share, if any, in the secured obligation). Under Spanish law there is uncertainty (a) if the beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in the security agreement will be deemed to have a valid and perfected security interest under such security as well as a secured claim in insolvency proceedings; and (b) with respect to the validity of any security interest created in favor of the security trustee under the Notes on behalf of the holders of the Notes. Therefore, there is a risk that a security agent would only be able to enforce against the debt it individually holds, and not for the full amount owed to creditors for whom it is acting as security agent or trustee. This limitation may be overcome if such creditors grant formal powers of attorney in favor of the security agent or trustee in order for the latter to represent them in the enforcement proceedings (yet, this may not work in judicial enforcement proceedings, where one party cannot represent another by virtue of a power of attorney). In the absence of the abovementioned power of attorney, the Security Agent and/or the applicable Trustee may not be able to enforce the Guarantee or the relevant Spanish security interest on behalf of all of the secured creditors (including the holders of the Notes). Further, those beneficial holders of the security who have not accepted the security or duly empowered (by means of notarial and apostilled powers of attorney) the Security Agent and/or the applicable Trustee to do so may be treated, from a Spanish law perspective including without limitation in an insolvency scenario, as unsecured creditors. Further, it is worth noting that there is a risk that the relevant court or notary public before whom any Spanish security interest may eventually be enforced might request both the notarization of the documents from which the relevant obligations arise, and the notarization of each and every one of the transfer certificates regarding each and every transfer of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

Prospective investors should note that the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law originally regulated by Law 22/2003 suffered various reforms and amendments since first published in 2003. The Spanish Government has approved in 2020 the latest recasting, in force as from 1 September 2020, in order not only to incorporate all these amendments but also to clarify and harmonize certain questions raised by the courts and the doctrine since its first application by Spanish courts, however, it should be noted that certain matters are still be subject to different views and different constructions by the relevant insolvency courts from time to time. The entry into force of Directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of June 20, 2019, on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, implies that Spain will have two years as of such date for the transposition of such Directive into the Spanish regulations. This transposition process will probably lead to the approval ----- of certain amendments to the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the transposition process has not been initiated yet and, therefore, is still uncertain how this Directive will affect the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 health crisis, the Spanish Government has approved various extraordinary resolutions. These extraordinary resolutions include, among others, Royal Decree-Law 16/2020 (Real Decreto-ley 16/2020, de _28 de abril, de medidas procesales y administrativas para hacer frente al COVID-19 en el ámbito de la Administración de Justicia) (“Royal Decree-Law 16/2020”), Royal Decree Law 34/2020 (Real Decreto-ley 34/2020, de 17 de noviembre, de medidas urgentes de apoyo a la solvencia empresarial y al sector energético, y en materia tributaria) or Act 3/2020 (Ley 3/2020, de 18 de septiembre, de medidas procesales y organizativas para hacer frente al COVID-19 en el ámbito de la Administración de Justicia) (“Act 3/2020”) as amended pursuant to the Royal Decree-Law 5/2021 of 12 March (Real Decreto- ley 5/2021, de 12 de marzo, de medidas extraordinarias de apoyo a la solvencia empresarial en respuesta a la pandemia de la COVID-19), which have introduced several temporary and extraordinary measures that impact pre-insolvency and insolvency_ proceedings. _Concept and petition for insolvency_ The Spanish Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Spain. As a general rule, in the event of an insolvency of the Spanish Guarantors, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Spain and governed by Spanish law. Namely, the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, as further amended, regulates court insolvency proceedings. The Spanish full-blown insolvency proceeding (bankruptcy), which is referred to as “concurso de acreedores,” applies to all persons and legal entities (save for limited exceptions specifically contemplated in the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, such as public entities). These proceedings may lead either to the restructuring of the business or to the liquidation of the assets of the debtor. The insolvency laws of Spain may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the laws of the United States, the United Kingdom or other jurisdictions to which you may be familiar. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Spain. In Spain, insolvency proceedings are only triggered upon debtor’s current insolvency (insolvencia actual) or imminent insolvency (insolvencia inminente). Under the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, a debtor is insolvent when it becomes unable to regularly meet its obligations as they become due and payable (current insolvency) or when it expects that it will shortly be unable to do so (imminent insolvency). Insolvency proceedings are available as a type of legal protection that a debtor may request in order to avoid the attachment of its assets by its creditors. A petition for current insolvency may be initiated by the debtor (in the case of a company, by a decision of its directors) (“Voluntary Insolvency”), by any of its creditors, provided that it has not acquired the credit within the six months prior to the filing of the petition for insolvency, for inter vivos acts, on a singular basis and once the credit was mature or by certain other interested third parties (“Mandatory Insolvency”). Notwithstanding, only the debtor is entitled to file a petition for insolvency on the basis of its imminent insolvency. The Spanish Recast Insolvency Law provides that insolvency proceedings conclude following either the court confirmation of the implementation of an agreement between the creditors and the debtor or convenio de acreedores (the “Company Voluntary Agreement” or the “CVA”) or the liquidation of the debtor’s estate. An insolvency proceeding can also conclude: (i) at any moment when it is verified that there are insufficient assets to pay post-insolvency debt; (ii) at any moment when it is verified that all of the credits have been paid, or the situation of insolvency does no longer exist; (iii) when it is verified that all of the creditors have waived their credit rights; or (iv) where only a sole creditor is identified in the definitive list of creditors. _Voluntary insolvency_ Insolvency is generally considered voluntary (concurso voluntario) if filed by the relevant debtor. The debtor must file a petition for insolvency within two months after it becomes aware, or should have become aware, of its state of insolvency. It is presumed that the debtor becomes aware of its insolvency, unless otherwise proved, if any of the circumstances that qualify as the basis for a petition for Mandatory Insolvency occur (please see “—Mandatory Insolvency” section below). In the event of failure to file a petition for insolvency within the statutory two-month period, it may be unable to exercise certain courses of action and personal liability of the directors may arise or be increased in the event of liquidation for the unpaid claims (on the basis of a rebuttable presumption that would be applicable in the qualification phase, when the directors’ liabilities are reviewed). ----- Notwithstanding the foregoing, this general rule of the debtors’ duty to file for insolvency within the referred two-month period does not apply if the debtor notifies the relevant court the initiation of negotiations with its creditors, to obtain support to reach a pre-arranged CVA; a collective out-of-court workout (a refinancing agreement or acuerdo de _refinanciación) set out in articles 598 or 606 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law; or an out-of-court repayment agreement_ (acuerdo extrajudicial de pagos) under articles 631 et seq. of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law (the “Creditors’ Negotiations",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

Although case law is not entirely consistent, it is broadly accepted that the following requirements must be met in order for a creditor to bring such action: - the debtor owes the creditor an amount under a valid contract and the fraudulent action took place after such debt was created; - the debtor has carried out an act that is detrimental to the creditor and beneficial to the third-party; - such act was fraudulent; ----- - there is no other legal remedy available to the creditor to obtain compensation for the damages suffered; and - debtor’s insolvency, construed as the situation where there has been a relevant decrease in the debtor’s estate making it impossible or more difficult to collect the claim. The existence of fraud (which must be evidenced by the creditor) is one of the essential requirements under Spanish law for the action to rescind to succeed (as opposed to claw-back actions where the subjective component or fraud does not have to be proven). Pursuant to article 1,297 of the Spanish Civil Code: (i) agreements by virtue of which the debtor transfers assets for no consideration and (ii) transfers for consideration carried out by parties who have been held liable by a court (sentencia condenatoria) or whose assets have been subject to a writ of attachment (mandamiento de embargo) will be considered fraudulent. According to case law and most scholars, the presumption referred to in (i) above is a iuris et de iure presumption (i.e., it cannot be rebutted by evidence), unlike the presumption indicated in (ii) above, which is a iuris tantum presumption (i.e., it is a rebuttable presumption). If the rescission action were to be upheld, the third-party would be liable to return to the debtor the consideration received under the contract in order to satisfy the debt owed to the creditor. Following that, the creditor would need to carry out the actions necessary to obtain the amount owed by the debtor. If the consideration received by the third-party under the contract cannot be returned to the debtor, the third-party must indemnify the creditor for such damages.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

This “center of main interests” is deemed to be where the insolvent party conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which may be recognized as such by third parties (although under European Union and Spanish law there is a rebuttable presumption that a debtor’s COMI is located where its registered address is). Insolvency proceedings conducted by the court of the “center of main interests” are considered “the principal insolvency proceedings” and have universal reach affecting all the assets of the insolvent party worldwide, with certain exceptions, such as security interests over assets located outside of Spain. If the “center of main interests” is not in Spain, but the insolvent party has a permanent establishment in Spain, Spanish courts will only have jurisdiction over the assets located in Spain (the “territorial insolvency proceedings”). In the event Spanish courts have jurisdiction, article 261 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law may apply, in which case the claims of the beneficiaries of the guarantee provided by the Spanish Guarantor may be classified as “contingent” claims and no amount may be recognized until and when a default occurs and the guarantee is validly enforced. Nor will they have voting rights. Special rules can apply if the guarantee is not a first demand guarantee but an ordinary guarantee (fianza) and, therefore, the benefits of preference (excusión), order (orden) and division (división) apply. Please note that other jurisdictions outside the European Union do not require a COMI shift in order for a Spanish company to make a filing in those jurisdictions (similarly as the UK concerning schemes of arrangements). Yet, recognition of foreign insolvency proceedings not based on COMI or in a reasonable connection of an equivalent nature under the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law should not be possible and, in addition, any creditor could file for a non-main insolvency proceeding in Spain.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

During this three-month period, creditors’ petitions for Mandatory Insolvency will not be accepted. During the fourth-month period: (i) the debtor has the duty to file for insolvency, unless a pre-arranged CVA, a collective out-of-court workout or an out–of-court repayment agreement is achieved (i.e., the company would gain four month grace period to file for insolvency by a Creditors’ Negotiations Communication); and (ii) the mandatory petitions could be filed but would not be accepted if the debtor has filed a voluntary insolvency petition (i.e., voluntary case filings have priority over involuntary ones within the fourth month). Likewise, the Creditors’ Negotiations Communication to obtain support to reach a pre-arranged CVA or a collective out-of-court workout (a refinancing agreement or acuerdo de refinanciación) set out in articles 598 or 606 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, prevents the commencement of court or out-of-court enforcement actions and/or suspends (as applicable) existing enforcement actions, over assets or rights which are necessary for the company’s business operations (other than those arising from public law claims) during a three-month period. In addition, enforcement proceedings that have been brought by creditors holding financial liabilities (pasivos financieros), as defined in article 606 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, shall be prohibited or suspended (as applicable); provided that it is evidenced that at least 51% of the creditors holding financial liabilities (by value) have supported the initiation of negotiations to enter into a refinancing agreement and have agreed to suspend or not initiate enforcement proceedings against the debtor while creditors holding financial liabilities are still negotiating. Nevertheless, secured creditors shall be entitled to bring enforcement proceedings against the corresponding secured assets. However, if these secured assets are necessary for the continuity of the debtor’s business or professional activity, once enforcement proceedings have been initiated, they shall be immediately suspended until three months have elapsed from the date when the Creditors’ Negotiations Communication is filed. Financial securities subject to the RDL 5/2005 and security interests over collateral located outside of Spain should not be affected by the Creditors’ Negotiations Communication automatic stay. Please note that, as a consequence of the of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Spanish government has enacted the Act 3/2020, as amended, which has stayed the obligation to file for insolvency until December 31, 2021 (please note that despite their obligation having been stayed, the directors still have the right to file for insolvency upon current or imminent insolvency). Likewise, according to the Act 3/2020, if the debtor filed a Creditors’ Negotiations Communication before December 31, 2020, the debtor has a six month grace period to file for insolvency as from the filing of the notice (instead of the ordinary four-month term). _Mandatory Insolvency_ Insolvency is considered necessary (concurso necesario) if filed by a third-party creditor and, in certain cases, by the insolvency mediator (mediador concursal). Under Section 2.4 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, a creditor can seek a debtor’s declaration of insolvency if (i) such creditor can prove that the debtor has failed to attach any assets, or sufficient assets, to pay the amount owed; or (ii) evidences before court a final previous judicial or administrative declaration of insolvency; or (iii) there is a generalized default on payments by such debtor; (iv) there is a seizure of assets affecting or comprising the generality of such debtor’s assets; or (v) there is a misplacement, “fire sale” or ruinous liquidation of the debtor’s assets; or (vi) there is a generalized default on certain tax, social security and employment obligations during the applicable statutory period (three months) prior to the filing of the relevant insolvency request. Upon receipt of an insolvency petition by a creditor, the court may issue provisional interim measures to protect the assets of a debtor and may request a guarantee from the petitioning creditor asking for the adoption of such measures to cover damages caused by the preliminary protective measures. The relevant debtor may oppose to the mandatory insolvency petition, and for which it will have to prove that it is not insolvent, unless the creditor’s insolvency petition is based on (i) the evidence of a final previous judicial or administrative final declaration of insolvency; (ii) the failure to seize sufficient assets of the debtor to pay the amounts owed; or (iii) the seizure ----- of assets affecting or comprising the generality of such debtor’s assets, where the Insolvency Court (as defined below) will hand down an order declaring the opening of the insolvency proceeding without hearing the debtor. In this case, the Insolvency Court (as defined below) will then summon the parties to a hearing, and will finally render a court ruling either dismissing the application filed by the creditor, or declaring the insolvency of the debtor. Pursuant to the Act 3/2020, until December 31, 2021, inclusive, the insolvency court shall not process the creditors’ filings for involuntary insolvency proceedings submitted since March 14, 2020. Any debtor’s filing for voluntary insolvency made until December 31, 2021 shall prevail over any filings made by any creditor. _Request of coordinated insolvency_ The insolvency of a company that forms part of a group of companies, including the parent company, does not automatically lead to the insolvency of the remaining companies of the group. As stated above, a company is insolvent when it cannot regularly meet its payment obligations as they fall due. This analysis is conducted individually at each company level. Notwithstanding the above, creditors may apply for a coordinated insolvency declaration of two or more of its debtors (acumulación de concursos) if either: (a) the assets are commingled, or (b) such debtors form part of the same group of companies. Therefore, the request for the coordinated insolvency of two or more legal entities may only be filed by a common creditor of the relevant companies and each of the affected companies must in fact be separately insolvent. Coordinated insolvency may also be requested by the companies themselves provided that they form part of the same group. As to ongoing insolvency proceedings, any of the insolvent debtors or the insolvency administrator, as the case may be, may apply for the procedural coordination under certain circumstances (and, in particular, if the insolvent debtors form part of the same group of companies). Moreover, creditors may apply for the procedural coordination of the insolvency proceedings of two or more of its debtors already declared if either (a) the assets are commingled, or (b) they pertain to the same group of companies, provided that a petition has not been submitted by any of the insolvent debtors or by the insolvency administrator pursuant to Article 41 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law. It is important to note that coordinated insolvency proceedings do not entail substantive consolidation. As a result, and as a general rule, a “group insolvency” does not lead to a commingling of the debtors’ assets and creditors of such group. This means that the creditors of one company of the group will not have recourse against other companies of the same group (except where cross-guarantees exist, in which case such a financial claim shall be subordinated). The current system that the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law provides for is basically a procedural which is aimed at making the insolvency proceedings as time and cost-efficient as possible. However, exceptionally, for the purpose of drafting the insolvency report, by the insolvency administrator only, assets and liabilities amongst the insolvent companies may be consolidated where the estates and liabilities are so commingled, in order to avert unjustified cost and delay. _Enforcement and termination in a pre-insolvency scenario_ It is uncertain that the obligations under the Notes and the Guarantee of the Spanish Guarantor will be enforced in accordance with their respective terms in every circumstance, such enforcement being subject to, inter alia, the nature of the remedies available in the Spanish courts, the acceptance by such court of jurisdiction, the discretion of the courts, the power of such courts to stay proceedings, the provisions of the Spanish law on civil procedure (Ley 1/2000, de 7 de enero, de _Enjuiciamento Civil, the “Spanish Law on Civil Procedure”) regarding remedies and enforcement measures available under_ Spanish law, the provisions of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law and other principles of law of general application. In this regard: - Spanish law does not expressly recognize the concept of an indemnity. Article 1,152 of the Spanish Civil Code (Código Civil) establishes that any penalty (cláusula penal) agreed by the parties in an agreement will substitute damages (indemnización de daños) and the payment of interest (abono de intereses) in an event of breach, unless otherwise agreed. Spanish courts may modify the penalty agreed between the relevant parties on an equitable basis if the debtor has partially or irregularly performed its obligations, unless the specific penalty (liquidated ----- damages) was aimed at such partial performance (and the liquidated damages clause is not disproportionate under fairness standards). There is serious doubt as to the enforceability in Spain of punitive damages. - Where obligations are to be performed in a jurisdiction outside Spain, they may not be enforceable in Spain to the extent that performance would be illegal under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction. - Spanish law precludes the validity and performance of contractual obligations to be left at the discretion of one of the contracting parties. Therefore, Spanish courts may refuse to uphold and enforce terms and conditions of an agreement giving discretionary authority to one of the contracting parties to have to fulfil it. - Spanish law, as applied by the Spanish Supreme Court, precludes an agreement being terminated on the basis of a breach of obligations, undertakings or covenants that are agreed as ancillary or complementary to the main payment undertakings of the relevant agreement and allows Spanish courts not to enforce any such breaches, unless otherwise established by the parties as a specific and essential termination event. Under Spanish law, acts carried out in accordance with the terms of a legal provision whenever said acts seek a result which is forbidden by or contrary to another law, shall be deemed to have been executed in circumvention of law (fraude de ley) and the provisions whose application was intended to be avoided shall apply. - A Spanish Court may award damages if the specific performance of an obligation is deemed impracticable. - A Spanish Court may amend the terms of contracts to the extent required to restore a proportionate balance between the obligations of both parties where such balance has been materially altered to the benefit of one of the parties because of the occurrence of unexpected and exceptional circumstances, which were unforeseeable at the time when the contract was executed. - A Spanish Court may modify the obligations deriving from contracts in the terms considered necessary in order to restore the balance between the obligations, if unexpected and exceptional circumstances arise that were unforeseeable when the contracts were executed, which would have been expressly or implicitly assumed. _Certain effects of insolvency_ For the debtor As a general rule and subject to certain exceptions, the debtor in a voluntary insolvency retains its powers to manage and dispose of its business (debtor in possession proceedings), but is subject to the supervision of the insolvency administrator (administración concursal) appointed by the court. In the case of mandatory insolvency, as a general rule and subject to certain exceptions, the debtor no longer has power over its assets, and management powers (including the power to dispose of assets) are conferred solely to the insolvency administrator. However, the court has the power to modify this general regime subject to the specific circumstances of the case. In addition, upon the insolvency administrator request, the court has the power to swap the intervention regime for a suspension regime or vice versa. Actions carried out by the debtor in breach of any required supervision of the insolvency authorities may be declared null and void unless ratified by the insolvency administrators. Subject to certain exceptions linked to the maintenance and conservation of the debtor’s estate, the debtor shall not sell or create security over its rights and assets without the Court’s authortization until the approval of the CVA or the opening of the liquidation phase. On contracts Under articles 156-159 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, all clauses in contracts with reciprocal obligations that allow any party to terminate an agreement based solely on the other party’s declaration of insolvency are deemed as not included in the agreement and, therefore, unenforceable, except if expressly permitted by specific laws (i.e., agency laws or the Spanish Royal Decree Law 5/2005, applicable to financial collateral, as defined therein (“RDL 5/2005”)). A declaration of insolvency does not affect the effectiveness of contracts with reciprocal obligations pending on performance by both the insolvent party and the counterparty, which remain in full force and effect and the obligations of the insolvent debtor will be fulfilled against the insolvent estate as post-insolvency credits/estate claims (con cargo a la masa). ----- However, if there has been a breach of such an agreement by either party after it has been declared insolvent, the court can terminate any such contracts at the request of the non-breaching party of the agreement or declare that the agreement remains in force because it is beneficial for the insolvency proceedings (mantenimiento del contrato en interés del concurso), in which case the non-insolvent party is entitled to seek specific performance against the insolvent estate and the claims stemming from such agreement will be considered as a post-insolvency credit/estate claims. Likewise, even in the event of non-breach by the counterparty of its obligations under such an agreement after the declaration of insolvency of the debtor, the insolvency administrator (together with the insolvent debtor or by its sole discretion if the insolvent debtor’s powers to manage and dispose of its business have been conferred to the insolvency administrator, as provided above) may request the insolvency court to resolve the termination of the agreement (on the grounds of convenience for the insolvency proceedings (resolución del contrato en interés del concurso)). The termination of such contracts may result in the insolvent debtor having to return, and indemnify damages to, its counterpart against the insolvent estate. In the event that the insolvent debtor, the insolvency administrator and the counterparty agree on the termination of the agreement and its effects, the insolvency court will approve the parties’ agreement; otherwise, if the insolvency court upholds termination, it will also fix the damages claim to be received by the non-breaching party due to the termination of the agreement. Additionally, the declaration of insolvency determines that interest accrual is suspended, except (i) pursuant to recent case law from the Spanish Supreme Court and article 152 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, ordinary/legal interest secured with an in rem right (so long as included as a contingent claim in the proof of claims), in which case interest accrues up to the value of the security (9/10 of the collateral fair value minus senior claims) (i.e., default interest are in any event stayed following the insolvency declaration) and (ii) any wage credits in favor of employees, which will accrue the legal interest set forth in the corresponding Law of the State Budget (Ley de Presupuestos del Estado). On enforcement proceedings As a general rule, the enforcement rights of unsecured creditors are suspended upon the court declaration of insolvency (with the exception of certain actions conducted by public authorities that no do not concern assets necessary for the continuation of the commercial or professional activity of the debtor). Additionally, once the insolvency proceeding is declared open, singular, judicial or extrajudicial enforcements may not be initiated, nor may administrative or tax demands for payment to be collected coercively against the assets of the debtor be continued. The enforcement of any security over assets or rights that are necessary for the continuation of the commercial or professional activity of the debtor may not be commenced and the procedures already initiated before the declaration of insolvency shall be suspended for one year. Enforcement will be suspended even if at the time of declaration of insolvency the notices announcing the public auction have been published. i. After such one-year moratorium without liquidation having started, a separated enforcement could be instituted, so long as the secured creditor is not bound by a creditors’ agreement affecting its claim. ii. Enforcement proceedings conducted before other courts or notary publics will be stayed within this one-year period unless the insolvency court declares that the collateral is not necessary for the continuation of the commercial or professional activity of the debtor. When it comes to determining which assets or rights of the debtor are used for its professional or business activities, courts have generally embraced a broad interpretation and will likely include most of the debtor’s assets and rights. Nevertheless, shares/quota shares held by an insolvent debtor in another company whose only activity is the holding of a material asset and servicing the financing provided in connection with the acquisition of that asset, are not considered to be an asset necessary for the debtor's business activity as long as the foreclosure of the relevant security interest that has been granted over such shares/quota shares does not bring about the termination or amendment of the insolvent debtor’s contracts with such subsidiary allowing the insolvent debtor to exploit such asset. The above regime does not affect financial collateral foreseen under RDL 5/2005 (the Spanish law implementing the EU Financial Collateral Directive), which shall be still enforceable, or where the collateral is located in another EU member state by the time of insolvency declaration. If the collateral is located in a non-EU state by the time of insolvency declaration, the automatic stay (if any) and, in general, the effects of the insolvency will be governed by the insolvency law of the state where the collateral is located. Pursuant to articles 44, 52 et seq. and 142 et seq. of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, in order to protect the interests of the debtor and creditors, the jurisdiction of the court dealing with insolvency proceedings is extended to handle any ----- enforcement proceedings or interim measures affecting the debtor’s assets (whether based upon civil, labor or administrative law). As a general rule, insolvency proceedings are not compatible with other enforcement proceedings which can have an effect on the insolvent estate (excluding enforcement proceedings with regard to financial collateral (as defined in RDL 5/2005) or collateral located in an EU state other the Spain or, subject to local law, a third state. When compatible, in order to protect the interests of the debtor and creditors, the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law extends the jurisdiction of the court dealing with insolvency proceedings, which is then legally authorized to handle any enforcement proceedings or interim measures affecting the debtor’s assets (whether based upon civil, labor, or administrative law). Finally, prospective investors should also note that enforcement of any security interests will be subject to the provisions of Spanish Law on Civil Procedure and Spanish Recast Insolvency Law (where applicable), which may entail delays in the enforcement. _Ranking of claims (priority rules)_ The court decision issued by the competent Insolvency Court declaring the opening of insolvency proceedings for a particular debtor (auto de declaración de concurso) shall contain an express request for the creditors (i) to declare those debts owed to them within the period of one month period as from the day after the publication of the insolvency proceedings in the Spanish Official Gazette (Boletín Oficial del Estado), and (ii) to provide the insolvency administrator with the relevant documentation to justify such credits. Based on the documentation provided by the creditors and documentation held by the debtor, the court insolvency administrator shall draw up a list of acknowledged creditors/claims and classify them according to the categories established in the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law that are summarized below. Under the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, claims are classified in two groups: i. Post-insolvency credits/Estate claims (créditos contra la masa): Section 242 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law sets out the so-called “estate claims,” which are pre-deductible (when they become due) claims from the estate (excluding those assets of the insolvent debtor subject to in rem security). Debt against the insolvent estate includes, among others: (i) certain amounts of the employee payroll; (ii) costs and expenses of the insolvency proceedings; (iii) certain amounts arising from services provided by the insolvent debtor under reciprocal contracts and outstanding obligations that are declared to remain in force after insolvency declaration as well as obligations to return and indemnity in cases of voluntary termination or breach by the insolvent debtor; (iv) those that derive from the exercise of a claw back action within the insolvency proceeding concerning bilateral contracts (except in cases of bad faith), (v) certain amounts arising from obligations created by law or tort liability of the insolvent debtor after the declaration of insolvency and until its conclusion; (vi) certain debts incurred by the debtor following the declaration of insolvency; (vii) insolvency administrator’s fees; (viii) in case of liquidation, the financing granted to the debtor under a CVA; and (ix) 50% of the new funds lent under a refinancing agreement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in articles 598 or 606 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, excluding the new funds lent by persons being in a special relationship with the debtor through a share capital increase, loan or analogous transaction. These post-insolvency claims are deemed “super-senior” in the sense that they are not subject to ranking or acknowledgement and, in principle, must be paid as and when they fall due; therefore, these claims are preferred to all others, except for proceeds from collateral subject to specially privileged claims (as described below). ii. Insolvency claims (créditos concursales): Insolvency claims are classified as follows: - Specially Privileged Claims (créditos con privilegio especial): Creditors benefiting from special privileges, representing security over certain assets (in rem securities) up to the amount of the value of their security, provided that such security is listed in the creditors’ list (in this regard, the value of a security shall be 90% of the reasonable value of the secured asset determined in accordance with the rules set out in articles 273 et seq of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law minus senior claims). The part of the claim exceeding the value of their security will be classified according to the nature of the claim. These claims benefiting from special privileges may entail separate proceedings, though subject to certain restrictions derived from a waiting period that may last up to one year and certain additional limitations set forth in the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law. As a general rule, privileged creditors are not ----- subject to the CVA, except if they are the authors of the CVA, they adhere to the CVA if certain majorities have been reached among privileged creditors of the same class (see “—Conclusion of Insolvency— _Settlement”). In the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment against the assets on which_ they are secured up to the secured amount. However, the insolvency administrator has the option to halt any enforcement of the securities and pay these claims as administrative expenses under specific payment rules. - Generally Privileged Claims (créditos con privilegio general): Creditors benefiting from a general privilege, including, among others, (i) specific labor claims and specific claims brought by public entities or authorities; (ii) 50% of the claims held by the creditor who filed for the insolvency of the debtor (provided that it is not a subordinated creditor); and (iii) 50% of the new funds under a refinancing agreement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in articles 598 or 606 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law. Similarly to specially privileged claims, these generally privileged claims are not subject to the CVA unless creditors holding claims benefiting from general privileges which represent at least 60% (or 75% depending on the workout measures envisaged under the CVA) of the total value of claims benefiting from general privileges of the same class vote in favor of such Reorganization Plan. In the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment against assets other than those secured by a specially privileged claim after specially privileged creditors, in accordance with the ranking established under the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law. - Ordinary Claims (créditos ordinarios): Ordinary creditors are all those creditors who have claims that are not classified as non subordinated or non privileged claims, and they shall be paid pro rata once the estate claims and both generally and specially privileged claims have been paid. - Subordinated Claims (créditos subordinados): Subordinated creditors is a category of claims which includes, among others: credits communicated late (outside the specific one-month period mentioned above); credits which are contractually subordinated vis-à-vis all other credits of the debtor; credits relating to unpaid interest claims (including default interest), except for those ordinary interests (as opposed to default interests) secured with an in rem right up to the value of the security interest; fines; and claims of creditors which are “specially related parties” to the insolvent debtor. In the case of a legal entity, the following shall be deemed as “specially related parties”: (i) shareholders with unlimited liability (in case such shareholders are natural persons it would include any special related party to these shareholders, as described herein); (ii) limited liability shareholders holding directly or indirectly 10% or more of the insolvent company’s share capital (or 5% if the company is listed or has securities listed in a secondary official market) at the time the credit is generated; (iii) directors (de jure, _de facto or shadow directors), insolvency liquidators, shadow directors and those holding general powers of attorney from the insolvent company (including those people that have held these positions during the two years prior to the declaration of insolvency); and (iv) companies pertaining to the same group as the debtor and their respective shareholders provided such shareholders meet the minimum shareholding requirements set forth in (ii) above (i.e. 10% or 5% if the relevant company is listed). Furthermore, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, assignees or awardees of claims belonging to any of the persons mentioned in this paragraph are presumed to be persons specially related to the insolvent debtor as long as the acquisition has taken place within two years prior to the insolvency proceedings being declared open. Notwithstanding the above, creditors who have directly or indirectly capitalized their credit rights pursuant to a refinancing agreement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in articles 598 or 606 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law (and who have even been appointed as directors) shall not be considered as being in a special relationship with the debtor, in respect of credits against the debtor, as a result of the financing granted under such refinancing agreement. Claims related to accrued and unpaid interest, unless and to the extent they are secured by an in rem, right are also subordinated. Subordinated creditors are second-level creditors. They do not have voting rights on the CVA but are subject to its terms, being paid once ordinary claims are satisfied pursuant to the terms of the CVA. Thus, subordinated creditors have limited chances of collecting payment according to the ranking established in the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law. As an exception to the subordination regime, new financing granted to the debtor pursuant to a refinancing agreement regulated under articles 598 or 606 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, which also contemplates a capitalization of credit rights before the granting of new financing, shall not be classified as subordinated claim under article 281 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law; provided that the requirements set out in article 283 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law are met. This is an incentive to promote refinancing and capitalization of credit rights. ----- Moreover, as a consequence of the of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Act 3/2020, of September 18 (in force as of September 20) has enhanced the position of certain “specially related parties” in order to solve situations of lack of liquidity. Accordingly, in insolvency proceedings declared on or before 14 March 2022: (i) financing granted by specially related parties; or (ii) financing in which they have been subrogated as creditors because of due payment (e.g., as a result of the enforcement of a personal guarantee, resulting in a claim of the guarantor vis-à-vis the debtor) would not be subordinated, but rather considered ordinary or privileged credit claims. _No termination effect_ The general principle of “no termination effect” is established such that all agreements remain effective at the time of the insolvency. Therefore, the declaration of insolvency does not impair the existence of the contracts entered into by the debtor, which would remain in force. Any contractual arrangements establishing the termination of a contract with reciprocal obligations and/or entitling the relevant creditor to terminate it in the event of the declaration of insolvency of the debtor will be unenforceable. As a general rule, the declaration of insolvency does not alter the general contractual rules on termination, but under the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, the judge may decide to remedy an eventual default of the insolvent party by reinstating an agreement, with the effect that any outstanding amounts and further payments under the agreement will be post-insolvency claims. If the court deems it appropriate for the interests of the insolvent party, it is also entitled to terminate an agreement, with compensation for damages if it deems it is best for the insolvency proceeding. There are specific rules for employment agreements, mainly affecting collective dismissals, which are dealt with by the insolvency judge. Additionaly, the insolvency administrator, on its own initiative or at the request of the insolvent party, may reinstate the credit, loan and other financing agreements whose acceleration due to non-payment of principal or accrued interest has occurred within the three months preceding the insolvency declaration (unless the creditor opposes it on the grounds that, prior to the insolvency declaration, has initiated proceedings for payment of the sums due against the debtor or any codebtor or guarantor). _Set-off_ The Spanish Recast Insolvency Law generally prohibits set off of the credits (compensación de créditos) and debts of the insolvent company once it has been declared insolvent, unless the legal requirement for set-off were met prior to the insolvency declaration; set-off of credits and debts which arise from the same contractual relationship entered into before the declaration of insolvency can be subject to set-off. However, set-off may be exercised by a determined creditor vis-à-vis the insolvent company if the governing law of the reciprocal credit right of the insolvent company permits it under insolvency scenarios. _Hardening periods_ There is no claw back date by operation of law. Therefore, there are no prior transactions that automatically become void as a result of the initiation of insolvency proceedings, but instead the insolvency administrator (or creditors that have asked the insolvency administrator to do so in the absence of action by the insolvency administrator) must expressly challenge those transactions that are considered detrimental to the insolvent debtor’s estate. Under the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, in particular under article 226 therein, upon the declaration of insolvency, only transactions that could be deemed as having damaged (perjudiciales) the insolvent debtor’s estate (i.e., causing a so-called “patrimonial damage”) during the two years prior to the date the insolvency is declared, may be challenged, even if there was no fraudulent intention. Transactions taking place earlier than two years prior to the declaration of insolvency may be rescinded subject to Spanish Civil Code based actions (i.e., fraudulent conveyance, which has a four-year look-back period). The Spanish Recast Insolvency Law does not define the meaning of “patrimonial damage.” Damage does not refer to the intention of the parties, but to the consequences of the transaction on the debtor’s interest resulting in the damage to the insolvent debtor’s estate or the prejudice to the equality of the treatment among creditors which drives insolvency proceedings (par condition creditorum). There are several “irrebuttable presumptions” expressly set forth by the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law (i.e., free disposals and prepayment or cancellation of the company’s claims or obligations prior to them being due and where the due dates of the relevant claims or payment obligations fall after the date of declaration of insolvency), except if such obligations were secured by an in rem security, in which case such transactions are subject to a rebuttable presumption of “patrimonial change” as set forth below. In addition to the above, the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law sets forth certain actions which are deemed to cause a “patrimonial damage” to the insolvent company, but which are “rebuttable presumptions” and therefore subject to being contested by the other party (i.e., disposals in favor of “specially related parties” (as described above), ----- the provision of security in respect of previously existing obligations or in respect of new obligations replacing existing ones and the payment or other acts to terminate obligations being secured by an in rem security and which mature after the date of declaration of insolvency). Ordinary transactions carried out within the debtor’s ordinary course of business cannot be rescinded; provided that they are carried out at arm’s length. Consequently, those acts that have been entered into by the relevant debtor may be rescinded if carried out during the two year hardening period and considered detrimental for such debtor’s estate. In particular, judges have considered detrimental payments made by an insolvent company prior to a declaration of insolvency, determining that in some situations a debtor could not be compelled to repay its obligations at the time of payment, because it was already unable to regularly pay debts as they came due. Guarantees granted by a Spanish company in favor of a third party, to secure other group companies’ debt may be subject to claw back, on the basis that such guarantees may be considered as detrimental to the guarantor’s estate, if the guarantor is not able to show that there was a tangible and identifiable corporate benefit for the guarantor to grant such guarantee (beyond an abstract group interest or general mentions to pertinence to the same group of companies or the so-called “group interest”). Whether or not the granting of any upstream guarantee by the guarantor is detrimental to the guarantor’s estate is a factual matter that will need to be proven on a case by case basis in accordance with the Spanish Supreme Court doctrine (the beneficiary of the guarantee bearing the burden of such proof). Case law has sustained that, when the parties had envisaged the creation of the security at the time of granting the financing, if there is a solid business reason to delay the constitution of the security, damage would not exist. In this sense, the Court ruling from Commercial Court no. 1 of Oviedo, dated February 18, 2010 (AC 2010\525) indicated that “in order to value if a security is _contextual to the creation or birth of the claim, it must be verified if the transactions that gave rise to granting the claim and the security were conceived by the parties simultaneously, hence reducing any importance given to the temporary delays there may be in order to technically grant the security.”_ Neither refinancing agreements regulated in articles 598 or 606 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, nor any transactions, acts and payments accomplished or any guarantees instituted in the performance of such refinancing agreements, will be subject to an insolvency clawback actions, provided that they comply with the requirements set out below in section “—Cramdown effects of certain refinancing agreements.” The consequence of the court resolution rescinding a prejudicial act is that the parties involved are required to return their reciprocal consideration with any accrued rents or interest (concerning bilateral contracts, otherwise, the only party obliged to return is the non-insolvent one). Such claims are generally regarded as estate claims unless in case of bad faith of the relevant creditor in which case its claims will be subordinated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to article 16 of the EU Insolvency Regulation and 730 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, acts and transactions governed by laws other than Spanish law will not be subject to claw back actions if such act or transaction cannot be rescinded or challenged by any means and under any grounds whatsoever (i.e., not only in insolvency scenarios) under the relevant non-Spanish applicable laws. Procedurally, there is no safe harbor against a lawsuit being filed and lenders being served to appear before Spanish courts, but the lawsuit should be dismissed on the merits if lenders prove (i) that the act or transaction at issue is subject to foreign law and (ii) that such act or transaction is unavoidable under the circumstances pursuant to that foreign law. _Protection of certain refinancing agreements_ Certain refinancing agreements denominated “collective refinancing agreements” may be protected from claw-back risk provided that they comply with certain requirements further explained in the section referred to as “Cramdown effects of _certain refinancing agreements.”_ In the case that such refinancing agreements are not subject to the procedure of judicial sanctioning therein described (homologados), they may still have certain (but not total) protection against claw-back, if they are backed by at least 3/5 (60%) of the total claims of the insolvent debtor (calculated on an individual and on a consolidated basis but excluding intragroup claims). Among other requisites, the refinancing agreements must be founded on a viability plan reflecting that the insolvent debtor will be viable in the short and medium term and must comply with the rest of requirements explained below. ----- _Cramdown effects of certain refinancing agreements_ In order to seek protection against claw-back, refinancing agreements (out-of-court workouts) may be judicially sanctioned (homologados) by the commercial court that will be competent to conduct an eventual insolvency proceeding of the debtor, upon request by the debtor or by any creditor having entered into such refinancing agreements, if: (i) the refinancing agreement is entered into in the context of a viability plan that allows the continuity of the professional activity of the debtor in the short and medium term; (ii) they entail a significant enlargement of debtor’s credit or a change in the financial structure by either granting a longer term or replacing previous claims with new ones; (iii) they have been subscribed by creditors holding financial liabilities representing, at least, 51% of the debtor’s financial liabilities whether or not subject to financial supervision (excluding from the calculation of such thresholds public creditors, labor creditors and those of commercial transactions) at the date of the refinancing agreement; (iv) the debtor’s auditor issues a certificate acknowledging that the required thresholds have been reached (in the case of a group of companies, certain courts have held that the majority refers both individually to each company and to the group as a whole, without the intercompany claims being taken into account); and (v) the refinancing agreement and the documents substantiating performance of conditions (iii) to (iv) above are formalized in a public instrument. Such judicially sanctioned refinancing agreements may not be subject to a claw-back action (save in case of fraud under general fraudulent conveyance actions). As to the rules to calculate whether the required thresholds have been reached, all creditors holding an interest in a syndicated loan will be deemed to have adhered to the refinancing agreement if it is favorably voted upon by at least 75% of the liabilities represented by the loan, or a lower majority if so established in the syndicated loan agreement. Whether dissident financial creditors have standing to object to homologation and whether the crammed down content may fall beyond the statutory one is not clear among Spanish scholars or courts and therefore it is not possible yet to ascertain what its practical effects will be. The following effects of homologated refinancing agreements may be imposed on (i) dissenting or non-participating unsecured financial creditors or (ii) on dissenting or non-participating secured financial creditors to the extent of that part of their secured claim not covered by their security interest, as such security interest is to be valued in accordance with the rules set out in the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law: (a) If the judicially sanctioned refinancing agreement is supported by creditors representing at least 60% of the debtor’s financial liabilities: i. stays of payments either of principal, interest or any other owed amount may be granted for up to five years; or ii. the debt converted into so-called profit participation loans (préstamos participativos) profit-participating loans of duration up to 5 years. Further, these effects may be extended to the amount of secured claims of non-participating or dissenting financial creditors in the amount covered by their security interest (valued in accordance with the rules set out in articles 273-277 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law), when the agreement has been entered into by financial creditors holding secured claims which represent at least 65% of the value of all secured claims of the debtor. (b) If the homologated refinancing agreement is supported by creditors representing at least 75% of the debtor’s aggregate financial liabilities: i. a deferral either of principal, interest or any other owed amount for a period of 5 or more years (but not more than 10 years); ii. haircuts (note that a cap has not been established); iii. capitalization of debt. Nevertheless, those creditors that have not supported such refinancing agreement (either because they did not sign the agreement or because they oppose it) may choose between (i) the debt for equity swap contemplated by the agreement; or (ii) a discharge of their claims equal to the nominal amount (including any share premium) of the shares/quota shares that would have corresponded to that creditor as a consequence of the relevant debt for equity swap (which works as the default option); ----- iv. conversion of debt into profit participating loans of up to 10 years, convertible bonds, subordinated loans, payment in kind facilities, or in any other financial instrument with a ranking, maturity and features different to the original debt; and v. assignment of assets or rights as assignment in kind for total or partial payment of the debt (datio _pro solute or pro solvendo)._ Further, these effects may be extended to the amount of secured claims of non-participating or dissenting financial creditors in the amount covered by their security interest (valued in accordance with the rules set out in articles 273-277 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law), when the agreement has been entered into by financial creditors holding secured claims which represent at least 80% of the value of all secured claims of the debtor. _Conclusion of insolvency_ Settlement Once the debtor’s assets and liabilities have been identified, the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law encourages creditors to reach a CVA regarding payment of the insolvency debts. The CVA may be proposed either by the debtor or by the creditors (if certain thresholds are met in the value of the claims of the relevant proposing creditors), and it shall set forth how, when and up to what amount creditors are to be paid. Once executed, the CVA must be honored by the debtor and respected by the creditors. The CVA must contain proposals for write-offs and stays. Article 317 of Spanish Recast Insolvency Law provides that it may also contain alternative or additional proposals for all creditors or for certain classes of creditors (except for public entities), including conversion of debt into shares, into profit-sharing credits, convertible bonds or subordinated debt, or any financial instrument different from the original debt. It may also include proposals for allocation of all assets or of certain assets to a specific person with a commitment from the acquirer to continue the activity and to pay off the debt as determined in the CVA. The proposals in the CVA shall include a payment schedule. In order for a CVA to be deemed approved by the creditors, the following majorities shall be met at the creditors’ meeting: (a) In case the CVA contains write-offs equal to or less than 50% of the amount of the claims; to stays on the payment of principal, interest or any other outstanding amount, for a period not exceeding five years; or, in the case of creditors other than those related to the public administration or employment matters, the conversion of debt into profit participating loans (préstamos participativos) over the same period, at least 50% of the unsecured liabilities (ordinary claims) have voted in favor of such CVA. Notwithstanding the above, a simple majority will suffice when the CVA consists of (i) full payment of ordinary or unsecured claims within a period not exceeding three years or (ii) immediate repayment of outstanding ordinary unsecured claims applying a write off of less than 20%. (b) In case the CVA contains stays of between five and ten years; write-offs of more than 50% of the amount of the claims and, in the case of creditors other than those related to the public administration or employment matters, the conversion of debt into profit-participating loans over the same period and any other proposal permitted under the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, 65% of the unsecured liabilities (ordinary credits) should have voted for the CVA. The holders of subordinated credits and those creditors considered as especially related to the debtor are not entitled to vote. Although in principle privileged creditors are not subject to an approved CVA (unless they have expressly voted in its favor) the effects of an approved CVA can be extended to privileged creditors; provided that the relevant CVA has been approved by the following majorities of creditors within its category of creditors (labor creditors, public law creditors, financial creditors or others): ----- (a) In case the CVA contains a write-off (or debt discharges) equal to or less than 50% of the amount of the claims, stays for a period no longer than 5 years or conversion of debt into profit participating loans, also for a period no longer than 5 years, at least 60% of privileged creditors have voted in favor; and (b) In case the CVA contains a write-off of more than 50% of the claim; stays (for a period between 5 and 10 years), conversion of debt into profit participating loans also for a period between 5 and 10 years, and any other proposal permitted under the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, at least 75% of privileged creditors have voted in favor. Pursuant to the Act 3/2020, A debtor can file a proposal for the amendment of the CVA until December 31, 2021. The insolvency court shall notify the debtor of any creditors’ requests filed between January 31, 2021 and September 30, 2021 for the declaration of breach of a CVA and shall not process them until December 31, 2021. During those three months, the debtor may file a proposal to amend the settlement agreement, which will be processed ahead of any creditors’ request for a declaration of breach. Liquidation Failure to obtain the approval of a CVA, a breach of a court-sanctioned CVA (as declared by the insolvency court) or upon debtor’s petition at any time leads to liquidation. The debtor must file a petition for liquidation if, after a CVA has been approved, it becomes aware of no longer being able to meet the payment commitments and obligations undertaken after the approval of such CVA. In such a case, the company will be aimed at dissolution and the directors (in the event of voluntary insolvency) will be removed. Deferred credits will compulsorily fall due and credits consisting of other benefits are converted into cash credits. The insolvency administrator will be required to prepare a liquidation plan that must be approved by the insolvency court. The insolvency administrator is required to report quarterly on the liquidation and has one year to complete it (although this is subject to extension by the relevant Court, at the request of the insolvency administration, what is the normal practice. If the liquidation is not completed within one year (or within the time agreed by the relevant Court after the petitions for extension), the court may appoint a different insolvency administrator. Pursuant to the Act 3/2020, the suspension of the debtor’s obligation to request the opening of the liquidation phase has been extended also until December 31, 2021 provided that the company files a proposal for the amendment of the settlement agreement and it is admitted by the court before that date. _Termination of the insolvency proceedings_ Article 465.6º of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law also foresees the termination of the insolvency proceeding at any stage when it is proven that all credits have been paid, or that all creditors have been entirely satisfied by other means, or that the situation of insolvency (i.e. the impossibility to face payment obligations regularly) has been overcome. Finally, it must be noted that article 473 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law foresees the termination of the insolvency proceeding at any time when assets are not enough to pay post-insolvency debt, as long as no future claw-back actions are envisaged, nor actions claiming liability to third parties, nor the assessment of the proceeding as guilty.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428
257_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,214,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,214.11,England and Wales,214.11.1,Administration,"Administration is an insolvency procedure under the IA86 pursuant to which a company may be reorganised or its assets realised under the protection of a statutory moratorium. There are two distinct methods for placing a company into administration: (i) an application to court followed by a court order for administration (the “in-court route”); or (ii) the filing of certain prescribed forms with the court following which the administration takes effect (the “out-of-court route”). The in-court route is commenced by an application to court by the company itself, its directors, one or more of its creditors including contingent or prospective creditors, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority or the Prudential Regulation Authority or certain other designated persons. The out-of-court method of appointment is available only to the directors, the company itself and the holder of a qualifying floating charge (“QFC”) (see further below for the meaning of this term) and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointor. A QFC is defined in paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 to the IA86 as being a floating charge created by an instrument which: (i) states on its face that paragraph 14 applies to it; (ii) purports to empower the holder of the floating charge to appoint an administrator of the company; or (iii) purports to empower the holder of the floating charge to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by section 29(2) of the IA86. A person is the holder of a QFC if he holds one or more debentures of the company secured by charges and other forms of security, which together relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s property and at least one of which is a qualifying floating charge. When any person other than a holder of a QFC makes an administration appointment (whether by the in-court or outof-court route), it will be necessary to show that the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts (see “—The _Insolvency Test”). Regardless of how an administrator is appointed, he will need to consent to act as administrator and to state_ that, in his opinion, one of the following statutory objectives can be satisfied (the second objective can only be considered if the first objective cannot be satisfied and the third objective only if the first two cannot be satisfied): (i) to rescue the company as a going concern; (ii) to achieve a better result for creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up without first being in administration; or (iii) to realise property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors (see “—Statutory order of priorities”). An interim moratorium takes effect when an application to appoint an administrator is made or a notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court. Regardless of how the administration procedure is commenced, this becomes final once the company is in administration. The moratorium means, among other things, that during the administration process no other legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress or diligence) may be commenced or continued against the company and no step can be taken to enforce security over the company’s property (in each case except with the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court), no administrative receiver can be appointed and any receiver of part of the company’s property will be required to resign if requested to do so by the administrator and, except in certain limited circumstances, no resolution can be passed or order be made for the winding-up of the company. This moratorium does not apply to financial collateral that has been created under a financial collateral arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (as amended) (the “Financial Collateral Regulations”) (generally, such arrangements are in respect of cash or financial instruments, such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments). An administrator owes his duties to the creditors of the company as a whole. Upon appointment, he takes control of the day-to-day running of the company and takes custody or control of all property, to which he thinks the company is entitled. He has broad powers to deal with the company and its assets, except in respect of assets which are subject to fixed charge security (where the consent of the holder of the relevant fixed charge is required in respect of any disposal of such assets). In the absence of consent from the holder of the fixed charge, the permission of the court is required to dispose of any fixed charge assets, which will only be granted if: (i) disposing of the assets in question is likely to promote the administration’s purpose; and (ii) the net proceeds of sale (plus any additional amount required to be added to the net proceeds so as to produce the amount determined by the court as the net amount which would be realised on a sale of the relevant assets for their market value) are applied towards discharging the company’s obligations to the fixed charge holder. An administrator’s powers further extend to investigating why the company failed and, where appropriate, bringing actions against the directors or former directors or seeking to set aside certain transactions (see “—Antecedent Transaction Laws” in respect of the latter). ----- An administration does not itself terminate any contracts and, unlike a liquidator, an administrator does not have the power to disclaim or terminate contracts (although he can choose to breach a contract if he considers it to be in the best interests of the creditors as a whole, in which case the resulting damages will rank as an unsecured debt, see “—Statutory Order of _Priorities”). Conversely, contractual terms providing for automatic termination or a right of termination by the counterparty_ upon the occurrence of an insolvency event (such as administration) will generally be enforceable as they are not considered to be against public policy as a matter of English law. However, there are exceptions to this general approach, most notably in the context of contractual supplies of goods and services - counterparties may not terminate these contracts (or the supplies they govern) or do any other thing (such as increase the pricing of the goods or services supplied under the contract) simply because the company enters administration, except with the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

In order to empower a person to appoint an administrative receiver to the company, the floating charge granted by the company to that person must constitute either: (i) a floating charge over the whole (or substantially the whole) of the property of the company created before September 15, 2003; or (ii) a QFC and the QFC must fall within one of the exceptions in the IA86 to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver under the IA86 is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the IA86), which will apply if the issue of the notes creates a debt of at least £50,000,000 for the relevant company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital market investment” (as defined in the IA86 but is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument). If an administrative receiver has been appointed and is in office, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying charge using the out of court procedure), and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference, or a floating charge (see “—Antecedent Transaction Laws”).",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

Once the liquidator has completed this task, the company will be dissolved and removed from the register of companies. There are two different types of liquidation: (i) compulsory; and (ii) voluntary, which is in turn divided into members’ voluntary liquidation (“MVL”) and creditors’ voluntary liquidation (“CVL”). Regardless of how he is appointed, a liquidator owes his duties to the company and its creditors as a whole and has wide powers to do whatever necessary for the conduct of the liquidation. This includes the power to: (i) agree, compromise and pay creditor claims; (ii) sell any of the company’s property; (iii) bring or defend any legal proceedings on behalf of the company; (iv) disclaim onerous property or contracts in accordance with section 178 of the IA86; (v) bring actions against the directors or former directors; and (vi) bring actions to set aside certain transactions (see “—Antecedent Transaction Laws” in respect of the latter). In a compulsory liquidation, there is an automatic stay on proceedings being commenced or continued against the company or its property except with the permission of the court. In a voluntary liquidation, there is no such automatic stay although the court may, upon the application of the liquidator or any creditor, order a stay under its general discretionary power in section 112 of the IA86.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

The grounds which entitle the court to make a winding up order are set out in section 122 of the IA86. The most common grounds are that: (i) the company is unable to pay its debts (see “—The Insolvency Test” for the meaning of this term); and (ii) the court is of the opinion that it is just and equitable for the company to be wound up. Under section 127 of the IA86, any disposition of the company’s property, any transfer of the company’s shares and any altering of the status of company members is void if made following the “commencement of a winding up”, unless the ----- court orders otherwise. If a winding up order is made, it is deemed to have commenced on the date on which the winding up petition was presented. This gives section 127 retrospective effect, meaning that the company cannot enter into any of the specified transactions during the period between the presentation of a winding up petition and the making of a winding up order without first seeking a validation order from the court. Pursuant to The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (“CIGA”) creditors are temporarily prevented from the use of winding up petitions unless they have reasonable grounds to believe that COVID-19 has not had a financial impact on the company or the grounds for the winding up petition would have applied even if COVID-19 had not had an effect on the company.

Under the IA86, creditors are placed into different classes and, with the exceptions and adjustments noted below, the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. The general priority of claims on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): _First ranking claims: holders of a fixed charge security and creditors with a proprietary interest in specific assets in_ the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor but only to the extent of the realizations from those secured assets or with respect to the asset in which they have a proprietary interest; _Second ranking claims: expenses of the insolvent estate incurred during the relevant insolvency proceedings, which_ include the remuneration of the officeholder (there is a further statutory order of priority setting out the order in which such expenses are to be paid); ----- _Third ranking claims: these are divided into ordinary preferential creditors and secondary preferential creditors with_ ordinary preferential creditors being paid in priority to secondary preferential creditors; Ordinary preferential debts include debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (i) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (ii) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person and (iii) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the insolvency date; Secondary preferential debts include any amounts owed by the insolvent company in respect of certain prescribed taxes (including VAT, PAYE and National Insurance Contributions); _Fourth ranking claims: holders of a floating charge security to the extent of the realizations from those secured assets._ This would include any floating charge that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on a proper interpretation, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below) must be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors; _Fifth ranking claims: general unsecured creditors (save where such creditors are deferred). However, any secured_ creditor not repaid in full from the realization of assets subject to its security can also claim the remaining debt due to it (a shortfall) from the insolvent estate as an unsecured claim; and _Sixth ranking claims: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist,_ these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing at least 75% in value of each class of creditors present and voting at the creditor meeting(s) vote in favour of the proposed compromise, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, that compromise will be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote on the scheme of arrangement and those who voted against the scheme of arrangement. In certain circumstances, a scheme of arrangement can also result in the release of guarantees in order to ensure the effectiveness of the compromise. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has the discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made to the scheme, or reject the scheme. Schemes of arrangement have always been outside the scope of the Recast Insolvency Regulation on the basis that they are not considered to be ‘insolvency’ proceedings (although they are, in practice, often used by financially distressed companies). Instead, if a scheme previously required recognition within the EU, Regulation (EU) 1215/2012 of the European _Parliament and of the Council on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (recast) (the “Brussels Regulation”) was relied upon as granting recognition of the judgment of the court sanctioning_ the scheme in each Member State. The Brussels Regulation ceased to apply to the United Kingdom on December 31, 2020, meaning that an alternative avenue of recognition for schemes is now required. Such avenues include recognition through the following instruments which, together, provide that schemes should still be recognized in Member States notwithstanding that the United Kingdom no longer benefits from the Brussels Regulation: - Lugano Convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters 2007 (“Lugano”): provides a framework for the recognition and enforcement of judgments (including those handed down in relation to English schemes of arrangement). The general position under Lugano is that a defendant domiciled in a jurisdiction which is a signatory to Lugano should be sued in the Courts of that jurisdiction, and that judgments given in the Courts of a signatory shall be automatically registered and enforced in the Courts of the other signatories. The United Kingdom was a signatory to Lugano by merit of its membership of the EU, and therefore ceased to be a signatory on and from December 31, 2020. The United Kingdom however applied to be re-admitted as a signatory in its own right on April 8, 2020. Whilst the United Kingdom’s application has not been accepted as of the Issue Date, if its application is accepted, Lugano should provide an avenue for the recognition and enforcement of judgments sanctioning schemes in the Courts of each other signatory. - Hague Convention of June 30, 2005 on Choice of Court Agreements (the “Hague Convention”): where parties have stipulated an exclusive choice of court agreement in their contracts, the Hague Convention requires that the parties’ decision and choice of court be respected. It further provides that any judgment rendered by the chosen court will be recognized and enforced in other signatory states. Consequently, the Hague Convention may allow for a scheme which seeks to compromise contractual arrangements which contain an exclusive choice of court agreement in favour of the Courts of the United Kingdom to be recognised in other signatory states. The United Kingdom ceased to be a signatory of the Hague Convention on December 31, 2020, but applied to be re-admitted on September, 28 2020. Its application has not yet been accepted as of the Issue Date. - Bilateral treaties: some Member States have their own laws, or bilateral treaties with the UK, that might enable recognition of an English scheme. However the number of these states is limited and the application of these laws and treaties to schemes is untested. ----- - The Rome regulation on the law applicable to contractual obligations ((EC) No 593/2008) (“Rome I”): determines the law governing contractual and non-contractual obligations and applies in all Member States (except Denmark). Following December 31, 2020, Rome I will continue to be applicable in respect of recognition by Member States (except Denmark) of judgments given in the Courts of the United Kingdom, allowing parties to choose the law applicable to the contracts and agreements and for the choice of law to be respected in all Member States. In the context of English law governed debt that is compromised under an English scheme, Rome I will allow the relevant scheme / restructuring plan order to be recognized throughout the EU.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

The process for a restructuring plan is closely modelled on the process for schemes of arrangement, with certain key differences. Those differences are: - Restructuring plans are only available to companies that have encountered or are likely to encounter financial difficulties that affect, or will or may affect, their ability to carry on business as a going concern. - Plan votes are calculated solely by the value of the relevant creditors' debt or members' shares (75% must vote in favour). No numerosity requirement applies. A dissenting class of voters cannot block the plan if the court is satisfied that: - none of the members of the dissenting class would be worse off than under the ‘relevant alternative’ (being the most likely alternative outcome, in the court’s view, if the plan is not approved – in most cases, this will be administration or liquidation); and - at least 75% by value of a class of creditors or members, which would receive a payment or have a genuine economic interest if the relevant alternative were pursued, has still voted in favour of the plan. A restructuring plan is therefore, in some respects, more flexible than a scheme because it enables a company to propose a compromise or arrangement with its creditors which can be approved if only a single class of its creditors vote in favour, provided that the above criteria are met. The plan is also subject to the same requirement as to fairness and reasonableness as a scheme, providing creditors with an additional safeguard. The Lugano Convention and the Hague Convention both contain exclusions whereby they are deemed to not apply to judgments handed down in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. As the law currently stands, the Court of the United Kingdom consider that restructuring plans fall within this exclusion due to the requirement that a company must have encountered or be likely to encounter financial difficulties in order to propose a restructuring plan. Unlike schemes, restructuring plans therefore fall outside the scope of the Lugano Convention and the Hague Convention. The recognition of a restructuring plan in Member States therefore depends upon Rome I and/or the domestic laws of those Member States, and may be less straightforward than the recognition of a scheme.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

A court generally will not intervene if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it. Subject to this, if the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into (which could include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside any security interests or guarantees granted). In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a “connected person” (as defined in the IA86), in which case there is a presumption that the company was unable to pay its debts and the connected person must demonstrate the company was not unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction, in such proceedings. An order by the court for a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not he is the person with whom the company entered into the transaction, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for value, or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who ----- received a benefit from the transaction in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where that person was a party to the transaction.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

A company gives a preference to a person if: (i) that person is one of the company’s creditors, a surety or a guarantor for any of the company’s debts or other liabilities; (ii) the company has done something (such as the granting of a security interest or guarantee), or has suffered something to be done which (in either case) has had the effect of putting that person into a position which, in the event that the company goes into insolvent liquidation, will be better than the position he would have been in if that thing had not been done; (iii) the company was influenced in deciding to give the preference by a desire to put the creditor in a better position than he would have been in if the thing had not been done or suffered to be done (this desire is rebuttably presumed in the case of connected persons); (iv) the preference was given within the relevant time (6 months before the onset of the insolvency or 2 years from the onset of insolvency where the transaction is with a connected person); and (v) the company was at the time of the transaction, or became as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts (as defined in the IA86). Subject to this, if the court determines that a transaction was a preference, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given (which could include the releasing of a security interest or guarantee granted by the company under such transaction). An order by the court for a preference may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not he is the person to whom the preference was given, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for value, or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the preference in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to that person at a time when he was a creditor of the company. The desire to prefer requires a “positive wish to improve the creditor’s position in the event of the company’s insolvent liquidation” (Re Fairway Magazines Ltd 1993 BCLC 643). A preferential effect for a creditor may be foreseen by the company without being desired. Where a company is influenced by “proper commercial considerations” there will be no desire to prefer and therefore no voidable preference (MC Bacon 1990 BCLC 324).",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

In all other cases, this means within a period of 12 months before the onset on insolvency when the company was at the time of the transaction, or became as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts (as defined in the IA86).

No court action is required save for in respect of the officeholder of a foreign proceeding recognised under the CBIR who wishes to apply for standing to challenge a voidable floating charge.

This provision may be used by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction and is not therefore limited to liquidators or administrators.

The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the person with whom the transaction was entered into.

The compulsory winding-up of a company by the court is deemed to start when a winding-up petition is presented by a creditor against the company, rather than the date on which the court makes the windingup order (if any).

Civil liabilities based on the securities laws of the United States may not be enforceable in the Netherlands, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. courts. The United States and the Netherlands currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not be enforceable in the Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must be relitigated before a competent Dutch court. A Dutch court will, under current practice, generally grant the same judgment without relitigation analysis on the merits if (i) the foreign court rendering that judgment has jurisdiction over the matter on internationally acceptable grounds and has conducted the proceedings in accordance with generally accepted principles of fair trial, (ii) that judgment does not contravene public policy (openbare orde) of the Netherlands, (iii) the foreign judgment is not in conflict with a decision rendered by a Dutch court between the same parties, or with an earlier judgment rendered by a foreign court in proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties, provided that the earlier decision can be recognized in the Netherlands, and (iv) the foreign judgment is—according to the law of its country of origin—final and conclusive in such a way that all appeals have been exhausted and no other remedy could be obtained from a competent judicial body have been exhausted and no other remedy could be obtained from a competent judicial body.

A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (tribunal judiciaire). Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non-ex parte) proceedings if the civil court is satisfied that the following conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law, do not include a review by the French court of the merits of the foreign judgment): - such U.S. judgment is final and enforceable in the jurisdiction of the court which rendered it; - the subject matter of such U.S. judgment is sufficiently or substantially connected with the jurisdiction of the court that rendered it, the choice of the U.S. court was not fraudulent and French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction to hear the matter; - such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both pertaining to the merits and the procedure of the case; - such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud; and - such U.S. judgment does not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment that has become effective in France and there is no risk of conflict with proceedings pending before French courts at the time enforcement of the judgment is sought. If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit from the res judicata effect as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus be declared enforceable in France. However, the decision granting the exequatur is subject to appeal. In principle, the appeal proceedings has no suspensive effect (i.e.: the Judgement will be enforceable notwithstanding the appeal). The claimant is however allowed to file a request before the 1st President of the Court of appeal in order to seek the freezing the enforcement of the exequatur judgement pending the outcome of the appeal proceedings). In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under certain circumstances by French law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French laws No. 80-538 of July 16, 1980 and No. 2000-916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to the communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Pursuant to the regulations above, the U.S. authorities would have to comply with international (the 1970 Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad) and French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France or from French persons. Similarly, French data protection rules (law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data files and individual liberties, as most recently modified by law No. 2014-344 of March 17, 2014) can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action in a discovery context. We have been advised by our French counsel that if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply foreign law (or part of foreign law) as designated by the applicable French rules of conflict or as chosen by the parties to govern their contract if its application is deemed to contravene French international public policy (as determined on a caseby-case basis by French courts) or in case of overriding mandatory rules. In an action brought in France on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought. Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual) may decide to bring an action before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign country with a French person. Pursuant to Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the French national in a foreign country with the foreign claimant. These provisions also apply in the context of non-contractual obligations. For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than French courts. However, according to case law from 2006 and 2007, the French courts’ jurisdiction over French nationals is no longer mandatory to the extent an action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction that has sufficient contacts with the dispute and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. More specifically, according to this case law, a French defendant can no longer challenge the jurisdiction of a foreign court on the basis of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code in circumstances where the foreign ----- court has otherwise jurisdiction. In addition, French and foreign claimants may waive his or her rights respectively to benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including by way of conduct by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court. In a decision dated September 26, 2012, the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) held that a contractual provision submitting one party to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the discretionary option to choose any competent jurisdiction was invalid on the ground that it was discretionary (potestative). In a decision dated 25 March 2015, the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) reversed the decision of the Angers Court of Appeal, stating that it should have examined whether the one-sided jurisdiction clause which did not set out an objective basis for the alternative jurisdictions that one party could choose, wasn’t contrary to the Lugano Convention’s objectives of predictability and legal certainty (which, so far as relevant, is the same as the Brussels I Regulation). Accordingly, any provisions to the same effect in any relevant documents would not be binding on the party submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court or prevent a French party from bringing an action before the French courts. On the other hand, a provision which allows to identify the alternative forum in which a potential dispute could be brought will be upheld.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

Consequently, a final and conclusive judgment by any U.S. federal or state court for payment based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. A final judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action of exequatur before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally would not reinvestigate and review the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below. The recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a German court would be conditional upon a number of factors, including but not limited to the following: - the judgment being final under U.S. federal or state law; - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original in accordance with the principles of jurisdictional competence of German law; - the defendant having had the chance to defend herself or himself against an unduly or untimely served complaint; - the judgment was not given in default of appearance and the defendant invokes such default or the defendant was not served with the document which instituted the proceedings properly or within sufficient time to enable him to arrange for his or her defence; - the judgment is not irreconcilable with a judgment given in Germany or a previous, recognizable foreign judgment recognition in Germany or the proceedings leading to such judgment are irreconcilable with proceedings that were filed (rechtshängig) in Germany previously; - the judgment of the U.S. court not being consistent with the judgment of a German court or a recognized judgment of a foreign court handed down before the judgment of the U.S. court; - the enforcement of the judgment by the U.S. court being compatible with the substantial foundations of German law (e.g. ordre public), including without limitation, fundamental rights (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Basic Law (Grundgesetz); and - generally, the guarantee of reciprocity.

We cannot, however, assure you that attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful under all circumstances.

Also, if circumstances have arisen after the date on which such foreign judgment became res judicata, a defence against execution may arise. ----- If an original action is brought before a German court, and the court does not decline jurisdiction, the court may apply not only EU and German rules of civil procedure, but also certain substantive provisions of the EU and German law that are regarded as mandatory and may refuse to apply U.S. law provisions, particularly those relating to certain remedies, if the relevant application violates German public policy. In particular, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages is usually denied by German courts as incompatible with the substantial foundations of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation or moratorium as well as other similar laws affecting creditor’s rights generally. German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. With respect to the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre- trial discovery process exists under German law.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

The United States and Spain are not party to any treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, any party wishing to have a U.S. ruling recognized or enforced in Spain must file an application seeking declaration of enforceability of the U.S. resolution (exequatur) with the relevant Spanish Court of First Instance (Juzgado de Primera Instancia) or Commercial Court (Juzgado _de lo Mercantil)._ The Spanish courts may express any such order in a currency other than Euro in respect of the amount due and payable by Adevinta Spain, but in case of enforcement in Spain, the court costs (costas judiciales) and interest will be paid in euros. Any judgment obtained against the Adevinta Spain in any country bound by the provisions of EU Regulation 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council would be recognized and enforced in accordance with the terms set forth thereby. The enforcement of any judgment in Spain entails, among others, the following actions and costs: - translation fees for documents in a language other than Spanish, which must be accompanied by a sworn translation into Spanish (translator’s fees will be payable); - certain professional fees for the verification of the legal representative of a party litigating in Spain (if needed); - payment of certain court costs and fees; - the procedural acts of a party litigating in Spain must be directed by an attorney at law and the party must be represented by a court agent (procurador); and - the contents and validity of foreign law must be evidenced to the Spanish courts. Moreover, please note that Spanish civil proceedings rules cannot be amended by agreement of the parties and will, therefore, prevail notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Notes. Notwithstanding the parties’ choice of foreign jurisdiction, the Spanish courts may in certain circumstances, including where considerations of Spanish public policy rules require it, take jurisdiction or grant ancillary relief in relation to proceedings commenced in a foreign court (including the chosen court). If an original action is brought in Spain, Spanish courts may refuse to apply the designated law if its application contravenes Spanish public policy. Pursuant to Article 54 of the current Spanish Civil Procedure Act, the parties to an agreement are entitled to clearly agree on their submission to a particular judge (juzgado) or court (tribunal) provided that, under the Spanish Civil Procedure Act and the Spanish Judicial Act (Ley 6/1985, de 1 de Julio, Orgánica del Poder Judicial), the relevant judge or court is competent to solve the relevant dispute; therefore such article does not cover the validity of non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses, at least for conflicts between different Spanish courts.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

In order to enforce a US judgment against a judgment debtor in England & Wales it would be necessary to bring a new claim (or counterclaim) in England & Wales to sue on the implied contract to pay created by the US judgment. Such a claim (or counterclaim) would be likely to succeed, provided that: - the court in which the original judgment was given had jurisdiction according to the English rules of the conflict of laws; - the judgment was not obtained in breach of an agreement that relevant disputes would be determined otherwise than by a court in the relevant US state; - the judgment was final and conclusive; ----- - the judgment was for a fixed sum of money and not directly or indirectly in respect of penal laws, taxes, fines, penalties or multiple (punitive) damages nor based on a public law of a foreign state; - the judgment was not obtained in a manner contrary to the rules of natural justice or by fraud; - the judgment does not conflict with a prior judgment of the courts of England and Wales or another court whose judgment is entitled to recognition in England and Wales; - enforcement proceedings are not time barred under the Limitation Act 1980 or otherwise; and - the judgment is not otherwise contrary to English public policy and does not violate the Human Rights Act 1998. A court in England & Wales would not generally reinvestigate or review the merits of the underlying claim decided by a U.S. court, except insofar as necessary to determine the defences described above. There is no requirement that a judgment from England and Wales would be enforceable in the US state where judgment was obtained. Provided that there is no arguable case that any of the above defences apply, the judgment creditor may be able to obtain summary judgment on the basis that the judgment debtor has no reasonable prospect of defending the claim. Once judgment has been obtained in a court of England and Wales in the manner described above, it would then be possible to enforce that judgment against the judgment debtor’s assets in England & Wales in the same way and to the same extent as any other judgment of a court of England & Wales. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions: - The asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; - The contractual terms of the financial asset meet the SPPI criterion. All other financial assets (i.e. financial assets that do not meet the criteria for classification as subsequently measured at either amortised cost or FVOCI) are classified as subsequently measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss (FVTPL). In addition, an entity has the option on initial recognition to irrevocably designate a financial asset as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency (i.e. an “accounting mismatch”) that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities, or recognizing the gains and losses on them, on different basis.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

The model is forward looking and incorporates historical information, current information, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions. For those financial instruments that have not had a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition or that have low credit risk at the reporting date (Stage 1), an entity will typically record a 12month Expected Credit Losses (ECL) (i.e., the expected credit loss that results from default events that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date). It is not the expected cash shortfalls over the 12-month period, but the entire credit loss on an asset weighted by the probability that the loss will occur in the next 12 months. For trade receivables, contract assets, and lease receivables, certain simplifications are available that eliminate the need to calculate 12-month ECL and to assess when a significant increase in credit risk has occurred, as they allow (or in some cases require) measurement of the loss allowance at initial recognition and throughout the life of an instrument at an amount equal to lifetime ECL.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

Under IFRS 9, full derecognition is appropriate once both of the following conditions have been met: - The financial asset has been transferred outside the consolidated group. - The entity has transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset. If there is a qualifying transfer, an entity must determine the extent to which it retains the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset. IFRS 9 requires the entity to evaluate the extent of the transfer of risks and rewards by comparing its exposure to the variability in the amounts and timing of the transferred financial assets’ net cash flows, both before and after the transfer. If the entity’s exposure does not change substantially, derecognition would be precluded. Rather, a liability equal to the consideration received would be recorded (i.e., a financing transaction). If, however, substantially all risks and rewards are transferred, the entity would derecognize the financial asset transferred and recognize separately any asset or liability created through any rights and obligations retained in the transfer (e.g., servicing assets).",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet as either financial assets or liabilities. They are initially measured at fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent measurement of all derivatives is at their fair value, regardless of any hedging relationship that might exist. Changes in a derivative’s value are recognized in the income statement as they arise, unless they satisfy the criteria for hedge accounting. According to IFRS, hedge accounting is permitted provided that an entity meets qualifying criteria in relation to documentation and hedge effectiveness.

257_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,218,US GAAP,218.33,,218.33.1,,"Revenue recognition under U.S. GAAP is similar to IFRS, with the exception of a few discrete areas such as collectability threshold, non-cash consideration and definition of completed contract. U.S. GAAP also allows entities to elect to account for shipping and handling activities that occur after the customer has obtained control of a good as a fulfillment cost rather than an additional promised service and to make an accounting policy election to present all taxes collected from customers on a net basis. Similar to IFRS, business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method, with limited exceptions, and annual impairment testing is required for goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life. Goodwill is assigned to an entity’s reporting units (RUs), defined as the same as, or one level below, an operating segment. The determination of reporting units is based on a segment reporting structure. Under US GAAP, Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if an event occurs to indicate an impairment. With the adoption of ASU 2017-04, the requirement for step 2 of the goodwill impairment test is removed. The goodwill impairment amount is the excess of carrying value over fair value of the reporting entity, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. U.S GAAP also provides private companies with the option of amortizing goodwill on a straight-line basis over a period not to exceed ten years. Under US GAAP, generally, both research costs and development costs are expensed as incurred, except that the treatment of costs associated with the development of software for sale to third Parties or with the development of software for internal use may be recognized. US GAAP generally does not require the component approach for depreciation. While it would generally be expected that the appropriateness of significant assumptions within the financial statements would be reassessed each reporting period, there is no explicit requirement for an annual review of residual values. d. **Spare parts A-2 ----- Under U.S. GAAP, there is no explicit guidance for accounting for spare parts and there could be a diversity in practice on how to account for them. All consolidation decisions are evaluated first under the Variable Interest Entity (VIE) model. U.S. GAAP requires an entity with a variable interest in a VIE to qualitatively assess the determination of the primary beneficiary of the VIE. In applying the qualitative model, an entity is deemed to have a controlling financial interest if it meets both of the following criteria: - Power to direct activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance (power criterion) - Obligation to absorb losses from or right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE (losses/benefits criterion) There is no requirement for uniform accounting policy between the parent and subsidiary. Reversal of impairment on equity method investments is not permitted. US GAAP permits recognition of loss in excess of investment amount when the imminent return to profitability by the investee is assured. The classification and accounting treatment of loans and receivables generally depends on whether the asset in question meets the definition of a debt security under ASC 320. To meet the definition of a security under ASC 320, the asset is required to be of a type commonly available on securities exchanges or in markets, or, when represented by an instrument, is commonly recognized in any area in which it is issued or dealt in as a medium for investment. Loans and receivables that are not within the scope of ASC 320 fall within the scope of other guidance, such as ASC 310, Receivables. Loans are generally: - Classified as loans held for investment, in which case they are measured at amortized cost; - Classified as loans held for sale, in which case they are measured at the lower of cost or fair value (market); or - Carried at fair value if the fair value option is elected. Under US GAAP, the legal form of a debt instrument primarily drives classification. For example, available-for-sale debt instruments that are securities in legal form are typically carried at fair value, even if there is no active market to trade the securities. At the same time, a debt instrument that is not in the form of a security (for example, a corporate loan) is accounted for at amortized cost even though both instruments (i.e., the security and the loan) have similar economic characteristics. Under US GAAP, the instruments in the scope of the general e current expected credit losses (CECL) model, lifetime expected credit losses are recorded upon initial recognition of the instrument as an allowance for loan losses. A-4 ----- US GAAP focuses on whether an entity has surrendered effective control over a transferred asset. The evaluation is governed by three key considerations: - Legal isolation of the transferred asset from the transferor - The ability of the transferee (or, if the transferee is a securitization vehicle, each third-party beneficial interest holder) to pledge or exchange the asset (or the beneficial interest) - The transferor has no right or obligation to repurchase the transferred assets As such, derecognition can be achieved even if the transferor has significant ongoing involvement with the transferred assets, such as significant exposure to credit risk. If a transfer of an entire financial asset qualifies for sale accounting, the transferred asset must be derecognized from the transferor’s balance sheet. All assets received and obligations assumed in exchange are recognized at fair value. If the transferor continues to service the transferred assets, a related servicing asset or servicing liability should be recorded at its fair value. Any gain or loss on the transfer should be recognized, calculated as the difference between the net proceeds received and the carrying value of the assets sold. U.S. GAAP defines a derivative as a financial instrument or other contract in the scope of the financial instruments that has all of the following features: - one or more underlyings; and one or more notional amounts or payment provisions or both; A-5 ----- - it has an initial net investment smaller than would be required for other instruments that would be expected to have a similar response to the variable; and - it requires or permits net settlement, is readily settleable through a market mechanism outside the contract; or provides for delivery of an asset that is readily convertible to cash. The new FASB hedge accounting guidance is intended to simplify certain accounting requirements for hedging activities, resolve practice issues, and better align hedge accounting with an organization’s risk management activities. Although both IFRS 9 and the amended ASC 815 guidance permit more hedging strategies to qualify for hedge accounting, the frameworks retain complex (though different) requirements for hedge accounting. Both the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting and the accounting for qualifying hedges are different. Similar to IFRS, business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method, with limited exceptions. A business combination is a transaction or other event in which an acquirer obtains control of one or more businesses. However, the U.S. GAAP guidance on control differs from IFRS and other differences relate to recognition of certain assets and liabilities based on the reliably measurable criterion, accounting for contingencies, and accounting for noncontrolling interests. Under US GAAP, LIFO is an acceptable inventory costing method with no explicit requirement for a consistent cost formula for all inventories similar in nature. Any write-down of inventory below cost creates a new cost basis that cannot be subsequently reversed. Deferred taxation is provided on all temporary differences between the tax and book bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted statutory tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is A-6 ----- expected to be settled or realised at the reporting date, subject to a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount which “more likely than not” will be realised in the future. US GAAP requires that all amounts be classified as noncurrent in the balance sheet. Similarly to IFRS, lessees will record all leases within the scope of the standard, regardless of classification, on the balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement. US GAAP is more general in defining incremental borrowing rate in that it simply requires use of a collateralized rate for an amount equal to the lease payments. Under ASC 842, a lessee can have either a finance or operating lease, determined using classification criteria similar to that used for capital leases in ASC 840. Under US GAAP, the income statement recognition for finance leases will consist of an amortization of the right-of-use asset and interest expense related to the lease liability, but for leases classified as operating leases the amortization of the right-of- use asset and interest expense related to the lease liability will be recorded together as lease (rent) expense to produce a straight-line recognition effect in the income statement. US GAAP does not have recognition exemption for leases based on value of the underlying assets. US GAAP permits companies to either (1) record gains/losses in the period incurred within the statement of operations or (2) defer gains/losses through the use of the corridor approach (or any systematic method that results in faster recognition than the corridor approach). Whether gains/losses are recognized immediately or amortized in a systematic fashion, they are ultimately recorded within the statement of operations as components of net periodic benefit cost. Under US GAAP, if there is a pre-existing arrangement such that the employer and employees have a mutual understanding of the benefits the employee will receive if involuntarily terminated, the cost of the benefits are accrued when payment is probable and reasonably estimable. In this instance, no announcement to the workforce (nor initiation of the plan) is required prior to expense recognition. Bank overdrafts are not included in cash and cash equivalents; changes in the balances of bank overdrafts are classified as financing cash flows under US GAAP. A-8 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

F. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities In March 2015, the Bundeskartellamt, or German Federal Cartel Office (“FCO”), conducted unannounced inspections of the premises of several metal packaging manufacturers, including a German subsidiary of the Company. The local court order authorizing the inspection cited FCO suspicions of anti-competitive agreements in the German market for the supply of metal packaging products. The Company conducted an internal investigation into the matter and discovered instances of inappropriate conduct by certain employees of German subsidiaries of the Company. The Company cooperated with the FCO and submitted a leniency application with the FCO which disclosed the findings of its internal investigation to date. In April 2018, the FCO discontinued its national investigation and referred the matter to the European Commission (the “Commission”). Following the referral, Commission officials conducted unannounced inspections of the premises of several metal packaging manufacturers, including Company subsidiaries in Germany, France and the United Kingdom. The Commission’s investigation is ongoing and, to date, the Commission has not officially charged the Company or any of its subsidiaries with violations of competition law. The Company is cooperating with the Commission and submitted a leniency application with the Commission with respect to the findings of the investigation in Germany referenced above. This application may lead to the reduction of possible future penalties. At this stage of the investigation the Company believes that a loss is probable but is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the Commission’s investigation and is unable to estimate the loss or possible range of losses that could be incurred, and has therefore not recorded a charge in connection with the actions by the Commission. If the Commission finds that the Company or any of its subsidiaries violated competition law, fines levied by the Commission could be material to the Company’s operating results and cash flows for the periods in which they are resolved or become reasonably estimable. The Company is also subject to various other lawsuits and claims with respect to labor, environmental, securities, vendor and other matters arising out of the Company’s normal course of business. While the impact on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists, management believes that the ultimate liabilities resulting from such lawsuits and claims will not materially affect the Company’s earnings, financial position or cash flow. The Company has various commitments to purchase materials, supplies and utilities as part of the ordinary conduct of business. The Company’s basic raw materials for its products are steel and aluminum, both of which are purchased from multiple sources. The Company is subject to fluctuations in the cost of these raw materials and has periodically adjusted its selling prices to reflect these movements. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be able to fully recover any increases or fluctuations in raw material costs from its customers. The Company also has commitments for standby letters of credit and for purchases of capital assets. F-10 ----- G.

Description of Business The Combined Financial Statements present, on a historical cost basis, the combined assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses related to the European Tinplate businesses (the “Company”) of Crown Holdings, Inc. (the “Crown Holdings” or “Crown”). The Company does not operate as a separate stand-alone entity and is comprised of certain Crown wholly owned legal entities for which the Company is the sole business, components of legal entities in which the Company operates in conjunction with other Crown businesses and majority owned joint ventures. The Company is a worldwide leader in the design, manufacture and sale of packaging products for consumer goods. The Company’s packaging for consumer goods include steel and aluminum cans for food, household and other consumer products and metal vacuum closures and steel crowns sold through the Company’s sales organization to the food, citrus, household products, personal care and various other industries. The Company operates 37 food and closures plants in 16 countries throughout Europe and Africa, including France, Italy and Spain, three aerosol plants in Italy and the U.K. and four promotional and specialty packaging plants in France, the Netherlands and the U.K. The food can business is seasonal with the first quarter tending to be the slowest period as the autumn packaging period in the Northern Hemisphere has ended and new crops are not yet planted. The industry enters its busiest period in the third quarter when the majority of fruits and vegetables in the Northern Hemisphere are harvested. Due to this seasonality, inventory levels increase in the first half of the year to meet peak demand in the second and third quarters. B. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Business and Principles of Combination.** The financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and reflect management’s estimates and assumptions. Actual results could differ from those estimates, impacting reported results of operations and financial position. All intercompany accounts and transactions within the Company have been eliminated in the preparation of the combined financial statements. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions with Crown are considered related party transactions and deemed to have been paid in the period the cost was incurred. Throughout the periods covered by the Combined Financial Statements, the Company, operated as a part of Crown. Consequently, stand-alone financial statements have not been historically prepared for the Company. The accompanying Combined Financial Statements have been derived from Crown’s historical accounting records and as if the Company operated on a stand-alone basis. The Combined Financial Statements include the historical operations, assets and liabilities of the legal entities and components of legal entities that are considered to comprise the Company’s business. The Combined Statements of Operations include all revenues and costs directly attributable to the Company, including costs for facilities, functions and services used by the Company. Costs for certain administrative functions and services performed by centralized Crown organizations are charged to the Company using an allocation method primarily based on percentage of sales. The Combined Statements of Operations also includes allocations of Crown’s general corporate expenses, including but not limited to, executive management, finance, legal, information technology, employee benefit administration, treasury and risk management. Current and deferred income taxes and related tax expense have been determined based on the stand-alone results of the Company in each country as if it were a separate taxpayer. Charges and allocations for costs for facilities, functions and services performed by Crown have been deemed paid by the Company to Crown in the period in which the cost was recorded in the Combined Statement of Operations. The Company’s portion of current income taxes payable is deemed to have been remitted to Crown in the period the related tax expense was recorded. The Company’s portion of current income tax receivable is deemed to have been remitted F-21 ----- to the Company by Crown in the period in which the receivable applies only to the extent that a refund of such taxes could have been recognized by the Company on a stand-alone basis under the law of the relevant taxing jurisdiction. Crown uses a centralized approach to cash management and financing most of its operations. Accordingly, the cash and cash equivalents included on the Combined Balance Sheets represents cash balances specifically attributable to the Company at the end of each reporting period. Transfers of cash, both to and from Crown’s centralized cash management system, are reflected as a component of Crown net investment on the Combined Balance Sheet and as a financing activity on the Combined Statement of Cash Flow. All related party long-term debt receivable and payable balances, including those supported by written agreements, between the Company and other Crown subsidiaries are included in Crown net investment, as the Company anticipates these balances will be settled. Crown’s short and longterm debt, and the related interest expense, has not been allocated to the Company’s Combined Financial Statements because it is not specifically identifiable to the Company. Transactions between Crown and the Company are accounted for through Crown net investment and are deemed to have been settled immediately. The allocations and estimates in the Combined Financial Statements are based on assumptions that management of Crown and the Company believes are reasonable. However, the Combined Financial Statements included herein may not be indicative of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company in the future or if the Company had been a separate, stand-alone entity during the periods presented. allocated to the discount is based on its relative standalone price and is recognized upon purchase of the additional product. Customer payment terms are typically less than one year and as such, the Company has applied the practical expedient to exclude consideration of significant financing components from the determination of transaction price. Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from net sales. Shipping and handling fees and costs from product sales are reported as cost of products sold and are accrued when the Company recognizes revenue over time before the shipping and handling activities occur. Costs to obtain a contract are generally immaterial but the Company has elected the practical expedient to expense these costs as incurred if the duration of the contract is one year or less. Unbilled receivables are recorded for revenue recognized over time when the Company has determined that control has passed to the customer but the customer has not yet been invoiced because the Company does not have present right to payment. The Company generally has a present right to payment when title of product transfers. Unbilled receivables are included in receivables in the Combined Balance Sheet with a corresponding decrease to inventory. Contract assets are recorded for revenue recognized over time when the Company has determined that control for a performance obligation has passed to the customer, but the right to invoice the customer is contingent upon the completion of the performance obligations included in the contract. Contract assets are classified as current as they are expected to be invoiced within one year and may not exceed their net realizable value. Contract liabilities are established if the Company must defer the recognition of a portion of consideration received because it has to satisfy a future obligation. Contract liabilities are classified as current or noncurrent based on when the Company expects to recognize revenue. Goodwill was allocated to the reporting units at the time of each acquisition based on the relative fair values of the reporting units. In assessing goodwill for impairment, the Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Further quantitative assessment may then be required. The quantitative assessment involves a number of assumptions and judgments, including the calculation of fair value for the Company’s identified reporting units. The Company determines the estimated fair value of each reporting unit based on an average of the estimated fair values using an income and a market approach. The income approach utilizes significant assumptions, including revenue and Adjusted EBITDA margin growth rates and discount rate. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, any impairment loss is measured by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. the use of derivative financial instruments, primarily swaps and forwards. Counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties. The company does not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. All outstanding derivative financial instruments are recognized in the balance sheet at their fair values. The Company applies a market approach to value its commodity price hedge contracts. Prices from observable markets are used to develop the fair value of these instruments. The Company uses an income approach to value its foreign exchange contracts. These contracts are valued using a discounted cash flow model that calculates the net present value of future cash flows under the terms of the contracts using market information as of the reporting date, such as foreign exchange spot and forward rates. The impact on earnings from recognizing the fair values of these instruments depends on their intended use, their hedge designation and their effectiveness in offsetting changes in the fair values of the exposures they are hedging. Changes in the fair values of instruments designated to reduce or eliminate adverse fluctuations in the fair values of recognized assets and liabilities are reported currently in earnings along with changes in the fair values of the hedged items. Changes in the effective portions of the fair values of instruments used to reduce or eliminate adverse fluctuations in cash flows of anticipated or forecasted transactions are reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings when the related hedged items impact earnings or the anticipated transactions are no longer probable. Changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are reported currently in earnings. Amounts reported in earnings are classified consistent with the item being hedged. The effectiveness of derivative instruments in reducing risks associated with the hedged exposures is assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis. Time value, a component of an instrument’s fair value, is excluded in assessing effectiveness for fair value hedges, except hedges of firm commitments, and included for cash flow hedges. Hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when (i) the instrument is no longer effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the underlying hedged item, (ii) the instrument expires, is sold, terminated or exercised, or (iii) designating the instrument as a hedge is no longer appropriate. The Company formally documents all relationships between its hedging instruments and hedged items at inception, including its risk management objective and strategy for establishing various hedge relationships. Cash flows from hedging instruments are classified in the Combined Statements of Cash Flows consistent with the items being hedged. The Company recorded a gain of less than $1 in Net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 and losses of less than $1 in Net income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. C. Relationship with Crown and Related Entities The Company has been managed and operated in the normal course of business with other affiliates of Crown. Accordingly, certain shared costs have been allocated to the Company and reflected as expenses in the Combined Financial Statements. Management of Crown and the Company consider the allocation methodologies used to be reasonable and appropriate reflections of the historical Crown expenses attributable to the Company for purposes of the stand-alone financial statements. The expenses reflected in the Combined Financial Statements may not be indicative of expenses that will be incurred by the Company in the future or that may be incurred by the Company on a stand-alone basis. All related party transactions approximate market prices. Related Party Purchases and Sales Throughout the periods covered by the Combined Financial Statements, the Company sold goods to and purchased goods from other Crown businesses. Net sales and Cost of product sold, excluding depreciation and amortization, included the following amounts related to the sale and purchase of finished goods to other Crown businesses: **2020** **2019** **2018** Related party sales ........................................... $ 44 $ 31 $ 29 Related party purchases..................................... 92 82 80 Receivable, net and accounts payable included the following related party receivable and payable balances with other Crown businesses as of December 31: **2020** **2019** Related party receivables ............................................................. $ 5 $ 4 Related party payables ................................................................ 14 15 Corporate Expense Allocations Crown incurs significant corporate costs for services provided to the Company as well as other Crown businesses. These costs include expenses for executive management, finance, legal, information technology, employee benefit administration, treasury and risk management. A portion of these costs benefit multiple or all of Crown’s businesses, including the Company, and are allocated to the Company using an allocation method primarily based on percentage of sales. Corporate expenses of $62, $58 and $56 were recorded in the Combined Financial Statements in selling and administrative expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Management and Financing The Company participates in Crown centralized cash management and finance programs. Crown maintains an international cash pooling arrangement which allows operations with excess cash to invest and operations with cash needs to utilize the excess cash. All short and long-term debt is financed by Crown and financing decisions for wholly and majority owned subsidiaries is determined by central Crown treasury operations. D.

257_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,220,NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,220.29,"Revenue Recognition. On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted new accounting guidance which outlined a single",220.29.1,,"comprehensive model to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and superseded previous revenue recognition guidance. The Company adopted the new revenue guidance using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were outstanding as of January 1, 2018. The Company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of Crown net investment. Under the new guidance, revenues are recognized when control of the promised product is transferred to customers. The majority of the Company’s revenues are derived from multi-year requirement contracts with leading manufacturers and marketers of packaged consumer products for can sets, comprising a can and an end. As requirement contracts do not typically include fixed volumes, customers often purchase products pursuant to purchase orders or other communications which are short-term in nature. The can and the end are considered separate performance obligations because they are distinct and separately identifiable. The Company manufactures certain products that have no alternative use to the Company once they are printed or manufactured to customer specifications. If the Company has an enforceable right to payment for custom products at all times in the manufacturing process, revenue is recognized over time. The timing of revenue recognition for the Company’s products may vary as these products may be printed or customized depending upon customer preferences which can vary by geographic market. Revenue that is recognized over time is generally recognized using the cost-tocost input method as these products involve an intermediary step that results in customized work-in-process inventory. For products that follow a point in time model, revenue is generally recognized when title and risk of loss transfer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. Standalone selling prices for each performance obligation are generally stated in the contract. When the Company offers variable consideration in the form of volume rebates to customers, it estimates the most likely amount of revenue to which it is expected to be entitled and includes the estimate in the transaction price, limited to the amount which is probable will not result in reversal of cumulative revenue recognized when the variable consideration is resolved. When the Company offers customers options to purchase additional product at discounted prices, judgment is required to determine if the discounted prices represent material rights. If so, the transaction price F-22 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

257_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,220,NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,220.32,Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced,220.32.1,,"amount and do not bear interest. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on past events, historical experience, current conditions and forecasts that affect the collectability of accounts receivable. Inventory Valuation.** Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost principally determined under the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) or average cost method. Property, Plant and Equipment.** Property, plant and equipment (“PP&E”) is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and includes expenditures for new facilities and equipment and those costs which substantially increase the useful lives or capacity of existing PP&E. Cost of constructed assets includes capitalized interest incurred during the construction and development period. Maintenance and repairs, including labor and material costs for planned major maintenance such as annual production line overhauls, are expensed as incurred. When PP&E is retired or otherwise disposed, the net carrying amount is eliminated with any gain or loss on disposition recognized in earnings at that time. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets described below (in years). The Company periodically reviews the estimated useful lives of its PP&E and, where appropriate, changes are made prospectively. Land improvements ...................................................................................... 25 Buildings and building improvements ................................................................ 25 – 40 Machinery and equipment............................................................................... 3 – 18 Goodwill.** Assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition.

Goodwill is carried at cost and reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year or when facts and circumstances indicate goodwill may be impaired.

257_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,220,NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,220.35,Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying,220.35.1,,"value of long-lived assets, primarily PP&E, may be impaired, the Company performs a recoverability evaluation. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is measured by comparing the carrying value of the asset to its fair value, based on discounted cash flows. Long-lived assets classified as held for sale are presented in the balance sheet at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. Leases. On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted new guidance on lease accounting. Under the guidance, lease classification criteria and income statement recognition were similar to previous guidance; however, all leases with a term longer than one year are recorded on the balance sheet through a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability. The Company has operating leases for land and buildings related to certain manufacturing facilities, warehouses and corporate offices, vehicle fleets and certain office and manufacturing equipment. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. The Company’s lease terms include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. Variable lease payment amounts that cannot be determined at commencement of the lease, such as increases in index rates, are not included in the measurement of the lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets and are recognized in the period those payments are incurred. The Company separates lease and non-lease components of lease arrangements and allocates contract consideration based on standalone selling prices. Variable consideration is allocated to the lease and non-lease components to which the variable payments specifically relates. The discount rate implicit within the Company’s leases is often not determinable and therefore the Company generally uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date of the lease in determining the present value of the lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is determined based on lease term and the currency in which lease payments are made. The Company’s leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted new guidance on the accounting for credit losses on financial instruments. The new guidance introduced an approach, based on expected losses, to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments. The new approach to estimating credit losses applies to most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in operating leases and off-balance-sheet credit exposures.

Commitments and Contingent Liabilities In March 2015, the Bundeskartellamt, or German Federal Cartel Office (“FCO”), conducted unannounced inspections of the premises of several metal packaging manufacturers, including a German subsidiary of the Company. The local court order authorizing the inspection cited FCO suspicions of anti-competitive agreements in the German market for the supply of metal packaging products. The Company conducted an internal investigation into the matter and discovered instances of inappropriate conduct by certain employees of German subsidiaries of the Company. The Company cooperated with the FCO and submitted a leniency application with the FCO which disclosed the findings of its internal investigation to date. In April 2018, the FCO discontinued its national investigation and referred the matter to the European Commission (the “Commission”). Following the referral, Commission officials conducted unannounced inspections of the premises of several metal packaging manufacturers, including Company subsidiaries in Germany, France and the United Kingdom. The Commission’s investigation is ongoing and, to date, the Commission has not officially charged the Company or any of its subsidiaries with violations of competition law. The Company is cooperating with the Commission and submitted a leniency application with the Commission with respect to the findings of the investigation in Germany referenced above. This application may lead to the reduction of possible future penalties. At this stage of the investigation the Company believes that a loss is probable but is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the Commission’s investigation and is unable to estimate the loss or possible range of losses that could be incurred, and has therefore not recorded a charge in connection with the actions by the Commission. If the Commission finds that the Company or any of its subsidiaries violated competition law, fines levied by the Commission could be material to the Company’s operating results and cash flows for the periods in which they are resolved or become reasonably estimable. The Company is also subject to various other lawsuits and claims with respect to labor, environmental, securities, vendor and other matters arising out of the Company’s normal course of business. While the impact on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists, management believes that the ultimate liabilities resulting from such lawsuits and claims will not materially affect the Company’s earnings, financial position or cash flow. The Company has various commitments to purchase materials, supplies and utilities as part of the ordinary conduct of business. The Company’s basic raw materials for its products are steel and aluminum, both of which are purchased from multiple sources. The Company is subject to fluctuations in the cost of these raw materials and has periodically adjusted its selling prices to reflect these movements. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be able to fully recover any increases or fluctuations in raw material costs from its customers. The Company also has commitments for standby letters of credit and for purchases of capital assets. F-30 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,428

Statement of Information Furnished The Combined Financial Statements present, on a historical cost basis, the combined assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses related to the European Tinplate businesses (the “Company”) of Crown Holdings, Inc. (the “Crown Holdings” or “Crown”). The Company does not operate as a separate stand-alone entity and is comprised of certain Crown wholly owned legal entities for which the Company is the sole business, components of legal entities in which the Company operates in conjunction with other Crown businesses and majority owned joint ventures. In the opinion of management, these combined financial statements contain all adjustments of a normal and recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2021 and the results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 and the cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. The results reported in these combined financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year. These results have been determined based on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), the application of which requires management’s utilization of estimates, and actual results may differ materially from the estimates utilized. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted. The accompanying combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with the combined financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company is a worldwide leader in the design, manufacture and sale of packaging products for consumer goods. The Company’s packaging for consumer goods include steel and aluminum cans for food, household and other consumer products and metal vacuum closures and steel crowns sold through the Company’s sales organization to the food, citrus, household products, personal care and various other industries. The Company operates 37 food and closures plants in 16 countries throughout Europe and Africa, including France, Italy and Spain, three aerosol plants in Italy and the U.K. and four promotional and specialty packaging plants in France, the Netherlands and the U.K. The food can business is seasonal with the first quarter tending to be the slowest period as the autumn packaging period in the Northern Hemisphere has ended and new crops are not yet planted. The industry enters its busiest period in the third quarter when the majority of fruits and vegetables in the Northern Hemisphere are harvested. Due to this seasonality, inventory levels increase in the first half of the year to meet peak demand in the second and third quarters. B. Relationship with Crown and Related Entities The Company has been managed and operated in the normal course of business with other affiliates of Crown. Accordingly, certain shared costs have been allocated to the Company and reflected as expenses in the Combined Financial Statements. Management of Crown and the Company consider the allocation methodologies used to be reasonable and appropriate reflections of the historical Crown expenses attributable to the Company for purposes of the stand-alone financial statements. The expenses reflected in the Combined Financial Statements may not be indicative of expenses that will be incurred by the Company in the future or that may be incurred by the Company on a stand-alone basis. All related party transactions approximate market prices. Related Party Purchases and Sales Throughout the periods covered by the Combined Financial Statements, the Company sold goods to and purchased goods from other Crown businesses. Net sales and Cost of product sold, excluding depreciation and amortization, included the following amounts related to the sale and purchase of finished goods to other Crown businesses: F-8 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,428
